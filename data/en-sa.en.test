the same de@@ al@@ t sub@@ ti@@ l@@ ly with our kind@@ red, and evil en@@ trea@@ ted our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live .
in which time moses was bor@@ n, and was exceeding fai@@ r, and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed up in his father 's house three month@@ s :
and when he was cast out, pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h 's daughter took him up, and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed him for her own son .
and moses was lear@@ ned in all the wisdom of the egy@@ pti@@ ans, and was mighty in words and in deeds .
and when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to vi@@ sit his brethren the children of israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wr@@ on@@ g, he de@@ f@@ en@@ ded him, and a@@ ven@@ ged him that was op@@ pre@@ s@@ sed, and smote the egy@@ pti@@ an :
for he suppo@@ sed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they st@@ ro@@ ve, and would have set them at one again, saying, sirs, ye are brethren ; why do ye wr@@ ong one to another ?
but he that did his neighbour wr@@ ong thrust him away, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
wilt thou kill me, as thou di@@ d@@ dest the egy@@ pti@@ an y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ?
then fled moses at this saying, and was a str@@ anger in the land of ma@@ di@@ an, where he begat two sons .
and when forty years were ex@@ pi@@ red, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sin@@ a an angel of the lord in a f@@ lame of fire in a bu@@ sh .
when moses saw it, he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the lord came unto him ,
saying, i am the god of thy fathers, the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob . then moses tremb@@ led, and du@@ rst not behold .
then said the lord to him, put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou stand@@ est is holy ground .
i have se@@ en, i have seen the affli@@ ction of my people which is in egypt, and i have heard their g@@ ro@@ an@@ ing, and am come down to deliver them . and now come, i will send thee into egypt .
this moses whom they re@@ fu@@ sed, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deli@@ ve@@ re@@ r by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bu@@ sh .
he brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that moses, which said unto the children of israel, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
this is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sin@@ a, and with our fathers : who received the li@@ ve@@ ly or@@ ac@@ les to give unto us :
to whom our fathers would not obe@@ y, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into egypt ,
saying unto a@@ ar@@ on, make us go@@ ds to go before us : for as for this moses, which brought us out of the land of egypt, we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
and they made a cal@@ f in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the i@@ do@@ l, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
then god turned, and gave them up to worship the ho@@ st of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets, o ye house of israel, have ye offered to me slain be@@ asts and sacrifi@@ ces by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
yea, ye took up the tabernac@@ le of mo@@ lo@@ ch, and the st@@ ar of your god re@@ mp@@ han@@ , fi@@ gu@@ res which ye made to worship them : and i will carry you away beyond b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on .
our fathers had the tabernac@@ le of witness in the wilderness, as he had appoin@@ ted, speaking unto moses, that he should make it according to the f@@ as@@ hi@@ on that he had seen .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the posses@@ sion of the gentiles, whom god dra@@ ve out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of david ;
who found fav@@ our before god, and desired to find a tabernac@@ le for the god of jacob .
but solomon built him an house .
howbeit the most high dwel@@ leth not in tem@@ ple@@ s made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
heaven is my thr@@ one, and earth is my foo@@ tstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
hath not my hand made all these things ?
ye sti@@ f@@ f@@ ne@@ cked and un@@ circumci@@ sed in heart and ears, ye do always resi@@ st the holy ghost : as your fathers did, so do ye .
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one ; of whom ye have been now the betra@@ y@@ ers and murde@@ rers :
who have received the law by the di@@ spo@@ si@@ tion of ange@@ ls, and have not kept it .
when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnas@@ he@@ d on him with their teeth .
but he, being full of the holy ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of god, and jesus standing on the right hand of god ,
and said, behold, i see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
then they cried out with a loud voice, and st@@ op@@ ped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord ,
and cast him out of the city, and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet, whose name was saul .
and they stoned stephe@@ n, calling upon god, and saying, lord jesus, receive my spirit .
and he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, lord, lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this, he fell asle@@ ep .
and saul was con@@ sen@@ ting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecu@@ tion against the church which was at jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the re@@ gi@@ ons of judaea and samaria, except the apostles .
and devout men carried stephe@@ n to his bu@@ ri@@ al, and made great la@@ men@@ tation over him .
as for saul, he made ha@@ vo@@ ck of the church, entering into every house, and ha@@ ling men and women committed them to prison .
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
then philip went down to the city of samaria, and preached christ unto them .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
for unclean spiri@@ ts, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with pal@@ si@@ es, and that were la@@ me, were healed .
and there was great joy in that city .
but there was a certain man, called simon, which be@@ fore@@ time in the same city used sor@@ cer@@ y, and be@@ wit@@ ched the people of samaria, gi@@ ving out that himself was some great one :
to whom they all gave he@@ ed, from the least to the grea@@ t@@ est, saying, this man is the great power of god .
and to him they had regar@@ d, because that of long time he had be@@ wit@@ ched them with sor@@ cer@@ i@@ es .
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god, and the name of jesus christ, they were baptized, both men and women .
then simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized, he continued with philip, and won@@ de@@ red, beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god, they sent unto them peter and john :
who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy ghost :

then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy ghost .
and when simon saw that through la@@ ying on of the apostles ' hands the holy ghost was gi@@ ven, he offered them money ,
saying, give me also this power, that on whomsoever i lay hands, he may receive the holy ghost .
but peter said unto him, thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be pur@@ cha@@ sed with money .
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of god .
repent therefore of this thy wi@@ c@@ ke@@ d@@ ness, and pray god, if per@@ ha@@ ps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
for i perceive that thou art in the ga@@ ll of bi@@ tter@@ ness, and in the bon@@ d of iniquity .
then answered simon, and said, pray ye to the lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they, when they had testi@@ fied and preached the word of the lord, returned to jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villa@@ ges of the samarit@@ ans .
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip, saying, arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto ga@@ z@@ a, which is desert .
and he arose and went : and, behold, a man of e@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a, an eunu@@ ch of great authority under can@@ da@@ ce qu@@ e@@ en of the e@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ ans, who had the charge of all her treasu@@ re, and had come to jerusalem for to worship ,
was retur@@ ning, and sitting in his cha@@ ri@@ ot read esaias the prophet .
then the spirit said unto philip, go near, and jo@@ in thyself to this cha@@ ri@@ ot .
and philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet esai@@ as, and said, under@@ stand@@ est thou what thou rea@@ dest ?
and he said, how can i, except some man should gu@@ ide me ? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him .
the place of the scripture which he read was this, he was led as a sheep to the sla@@ ugh@@ ter ; and like a la@@ mb dumb before his s@@ hea@@ re@@ r, so opened he not his mouth :
in his hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
and the eunu@@ ch answered philip, and said, i pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself, or of some other man ?
then philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scriptu@@ re, and preached unto him jesus .
and as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water : and the eunu@@ ch said, see, here is water ; what doth hin@@ der me to be baptized ?
and philip said, if thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest . and he answered and said, i believe that jesus christ is the son of god .
and he commanded the cha@@ ri@@ ot to stand still : and they went down both into the water, both philip and the eunu@@ ch ; and he baptized him .
and when they were come up out of the water, the spirit of the lord caught away philip, that the eunu@@ ch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoi@@ c@@ ing .
but philip was found at a@@ z@@ o@@ tus : and pas@@ sing through he preached in all the ci@@ ties, till he came to caesarea .
and saul, yet brea@@ thing out th@@ rea@@ ten@@ ings and sla@@ ugh@@ ter against the disciples of the lord, went unto the high priest ,
and desired of him le@@ tters to damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto jerusalem .
and as he journe@@ ye@@ d, he came near damascus : and suddenly there shi@@ ned round about him a light from heaven :
and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ?
and he said, who art thou, lord ? and the lord said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to ki@@ ck against the pri@@ c@@ ks .
and he tremb@@ ling and astonished said, lord, what wilt thou have me to do ? and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and the men which journe@@ yed with him stood spee@@ ch@@ les@@ s, hearing a voice, but seeing no man .
and saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man : but they led him by the hand, and brought him into damascus .
and he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink .
and there was a certain disciple at damasc@@ us, named ananias ; and to him said the lord in a visi@@ on, ananias . and he said, behold, i am here, lord .
and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the stre@@ et which is called strai@@ ght, and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul, of tar@@ sus : for, behold, he praye@@ th ,
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in, and pu@@ tting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight .
then ananias answered, lord, i have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy sa@@ ints at jerusalem :
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
but the lord said unto him, go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the gentiles, and king@@ s, and the children of israel :
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name 's sake .
and ananias went his way, and entered into the house ; and pu@@ tting his hands on him said, brother saul, the lord, even jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou ca@@ m@@ est, hath sent me, that thou mi@@ ght@@ est receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy ghost .
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been sca@@ les : and he received sight forth@@ wi@@ th, and arose, and was baptized .
and when he had received meat, he was streng@@ the@@ ned . then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus .
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues, that he is the son of god .
but all that heard him were amazed, and said ; is not this he that destro@@ yed them which called on this name in jerusalem, and came hither for that int@@ ent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
but saul incre@@ ased the more in streng@@ th, and con@@ f@@ ounded the jews which dwelt at damasc@@ us, pro@@ ving that this is very christ .
and after that many days were fulfilled, the jews took counsel to kill him :
but their la@@ ying a@@ wait was known of saul . and they watched the ga@@ tes day and night to kill him .
then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the w@@ all in a baske@@ t .
and when saul was come to jerusalem, he as@@ say@@ ed to jo@@ in himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple .
but barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached bold@@ ly at damascus in the name of jesus .
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem .
and he spake bold@@ ly in the name of the lord jesus, and dispu@@ ted against the gre@@ ci@@ ans : but they went about to slay him .
which when the brethren kne@@ w, they brought him down to caesa@@ rea, and sent him forth to tar@@ sus .
then had the chur@@ ches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria, and were e@@ di@@ fied ; and walking in the fear of the lord, and in the comfor@@ t of the holy ghost, were multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and it came to pass, as peter passed throughout all qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, he came down also to the sa@@ ints which dwelt at ly@@ d@@ da .
and there he found a certain man named a@@ ene@@ as, which had kept his bed ei@@ ght years, and was sick of the pal@@ sy .
and peter said unto him, a@@ ene@@ as, jesus christ ma@@ keth thee whole : arise, and make thy bed . and he arose immediately .
and all that dwelt at ly@@ d@@ da and sa@@ r@@ on saw him, and turned to the lord .
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named ta@@ bi@@ tha, which by interpre@@ tation is called d@@ or@@ c@@ as : this woman was full of good works and al@@ m@@ s@@ deeds which she did .
and it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died : whom when they had washe@@ d, they laid her in an upper cha@@ mber .
and forasmuch as ly@@ d@@ da was nigh to jo@@ ppa, and the disciples had heard that peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not de@@ lay to come to them .
then peter arose and went with them . when he was come, they brought him into the upper cha@@ mber : and all the widows stood by him weep@@ ing, and she@@ wing the coa@@ ts and garments which d@@ or@@ c@@ as ma@@ de, while she was with them .
but peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed ; and tur@@ ning him to the body said, ta@@ bi@@ tha, arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw peter, she sat up .
and he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the sa@@ ints and widow@@ s, presen@@ ted her a@@ live .
and it was known throughout all joppa ; and many believed in the lord .
and it came to pass, that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tan@@ ner .
there was a certain man in caesarea called corneli@@ us, a centurion of the band called the i@@ ta@@ li@@ an band ,
a devout man, and one that feared god with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to god al@@ way .
he saw in a vision evi@@ den@@ tly about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him, and saying unto him, cornelius .
and when he looked on him, he was afrai@@ d, and said, what is it, lord ? and he said unto him, thy pray@@ ers and thine alms are come up for a me@@ mor@@ i@@ al before god .
and now send men to jo@@ ppa, and call for one simon, whose surname is peter :
he lod@@ ge@@ th with one simon a tan@@ n@@ er, whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou ou@@ ght@@ est to do .
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed, he called two of his house@@ hold servants, and a devout soldi@@ er of them that waited on him continu@@ al@@ ly ;
and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to joppa .
on the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, peter went up upon the house@@ top to pray about the sixth hour :
and he be@@ came very hun@@ gr@@ y, and would have eaten : but while they made ready, he fell into a tr@@ ance ,
and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descen@@ ding upon him, as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ n@@ ers, and let down to the earth :
wherein were all manner of four@@ foo@@ ted be@@ asts of the earth, and wi@@ ld be@@ ast@@ s, and cre@@ ep@@ ing things, and fowls of the air .
and there came a voice to him, rise, peter ; ki@@ ll, and eat .
but peter said, not so, lord ; for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
and the voice spake unto him again the second time, what god hath clean@@ sed, that call not thou common .
this was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
now while peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should me@@ an, behold, the men which were sent from cornelius had made enqui@@ ry for simon 's house, and stood before the gate ,
and called, and asked whether simon, which was surnamed peter, were lodged there .
while peter thought on the visi@@ on, the spirit said unto him, behold, three men seek thee .
arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doub@@ ting nothing : for i have sent them .
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius ; and said, behold, i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and they said, cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fea@@ reth god, and of good re@@ port among all the nation of the jews, was war@@ ned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee .
then called he them in, and lodged them . and on the morrow peter went away with them, and certain brethren from joppa accomp@@ ani@@ ed him .
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea . and cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kin@@ s@@ men and near friends .
and as peter was coming in, cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him .
but peter took him up, saying, stand up ; i myself also am a man .
and as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together .
and he said unto them, ye know how that it is an un@@ lawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep comp@@ an@@ y, or come unto one of another nation ; but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean .
therefore came i unto you without ga@@ in@@ saying, as soon as i was sent for : i ask therefore for what int@@ ent ye have sent for me ?
and cornelius said, four days a@@ go i was fa@@ sting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in b@@ right clo@@ thing ,
and said, corneli@@ us, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance in the sight of god .
send therefore to jo@@ ppa, and call hither simon, whose surname is peter ; he is lodged in the house of one simon a tan@@ ner by the sea side : who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee .
immediately therefore i sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before god, to hear all things that are commanded thee of god .
then peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth i perceive that god is no re@@ spe@@ c@@ ter of per@@ sons :
but in every nation he that fea@@ reth him, and wor@@ keth righteousness, is ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted with him .
the word which god sent unto the children of israel, preaching peace by jesus christ :
that word, i say, ye know, which was publi@@ shed throughout all judaea, and began from galilee, after the baptism which john preached ;
how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power : who went about do@@ ing good, and healing all that were op@@ pre@@ ssed of the devil ; for god was with him .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews, and in jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
him god raised up the third day, and shewed him openly ;
not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before god, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of qui@@ ck and dead .
to him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins .
while peter yet spake these words, the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
and they of the circumci@@ sion which believed were astoni@@ shed, as many as came with peter, because that on the gentiles also was p@@ oured out the gift of the holy ghost .
for they heard them speak with tongu@@ es, and mag@@ ni@@ fy god . then answered peter ,
can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy ghost as well as we ?
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god .
and when peter was come up to jerusalem, they that were of the circumci@@ sion cont@@ en@@ ded with him ,
saying, thou w@@ en@@ test in to men un@@ circumci@@ sed, and didst eat with them .
but peter re@@ hear@@ sed the matter from the begin@@ ning, and ex@@ p@@ ounded it by or@@ der unto them, saying ,
i was in the city of joppa pra@@ ying : and in a tr@@ ance i saw a visi@@ on, a certain vessel descen@@ d, as it had been a great she@@ e@@ t, let down from heaven by four cor@@ ners ; and it came even to me :
upon the which when i had fast@@ ened mine eyes, i consi@@ de@@ red, and saw four@@ foo@@ ted be@@ asts of the earth, and wi@@ ld be@@ ast@@ s, and cre@@ ep@@ ing things, and fowls of the air .
and i heard a voice saying unto me, arise, peter ; slay and eat .
but i said, not so, lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
but the voice answered me again from heaven, what god hath clean@@ sed, that call not thou common .
and this was done three times : and all were dra@@ wn up again into heaven .
and, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was, sent from caesarea unto me .
and the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doub@@ ting . moreover these six brethren accomp@@ ani@@ ed me, and we entered into the man 's house :
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, send men to jo@@ ppa, and call for simon, whose surname is peter ;
who shall tell thee words, where@@ by thou and all thy house shall be saved .
and as i began to speak, the holy ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning .
then remembered i the word of the lord, how that he said, john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost .
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the lord jesus christ ; what was i, that i could with@@ stand god ?
when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified god, saying, then hath god also to the gentiles gran@@ ted repentance unto life .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecu@@ tion that arose about stephe@@ n tra@@ ve@@ lled as far as phe@@ ni@@ ce, and cyp@@ ru@@ s, and antio@@ ch, preaching the word to none but unto the jews only .
and some of them were men of cyp@@ r@@ us and cy@@ ren@@ e, which, when they were come to antio@@ ch, spake unto the gre@@ ci@@ ans, preaching the lord jesus .
and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number believed, and turned unto the lord .
then tid@@ ings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas, that he should go as far as antioch .
who, when he came, and had seen the grace of god, was gla@@ d, and exhor@@ ted them all, that with purpo@@ se of heart they would c@@ leave unto the lord .
for he was a good man, and full of the holy ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
then departed barnabas to tar@@ sus, for to seek saul :
and when he had found him, he brought him unto antioch . and it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people . and the disciples were called chri@@ sti@@ ans first in antioch .
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
and there stood up one of them named aga@@ bu@@ s, and signi@@ fied by the spirit that there should be great de@@ ar@@ th throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of c@@ lau@@ di@@ us caesar .
then the disciples, every man according to his abi@@ li@@ ty, determined to send re@@ lie@@ f unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea :
which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul .
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to ve@@ x certain of the church .
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
and because he saw it pleased the jews, he proce@@ e@@ ded further to take peter also .
and when he had ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ ded him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four qua@@ ter@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; int@@ en@@ ding after e@@ as@@ ter to bring him forth to the people .
peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ce@@ as@@ ing of the church unto god for him .
and when herod would have brought him forth, the same night peter was sle@@ ep@@ ing between two soldiers, bound with two cha@@ ins : and the kee@@ pers before the door kept the prison .
and, behold, the angel of the lord came upon him, and a light shi@@ ned in the prison : and he smote peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, arise up quick@@ ly . and his cha@@ ins fell off from his hands .
and the angel said unto him, gi@@ rd thyself, and bind on thy s@@ and@@ al@@ s . and so he did . and he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee, and follow me .
and he went out, and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
when they were pa@@ st the first and the second ward, they came unto the i@@ r@@ on gate that lea@@ deth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out, and passed on through one stre@@ et ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
and when peter was come to himself, he said, now i know of a sure@@ ty, that the lord hath sent his ange@@ l, and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod, and from all the expe@@ c@@ tation of the people of the jews .
and when he had consi@@ dered the thing, he came to the house of mary the mother of john, whose surname was mar@@ k ; where many were gathered together pra@@ ying .
and as peter kno@@ cked at the door of the ga@@ te, a damsel came to hear@@ ken, named r@@ ho@@ da .
and when she knew peter 's voice, she opened not the gate for gla@@ d@@ ness, but ran in, and told how peter stood before the gate .
and they said unto her, thou art ma@@ d . but she con@@ stan@@ tly af@@ fir@@ med that it was even so . then said they, it is his angel .
but peter continued kno@@ c@@ king : and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished .
but he, beck@@ oning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said, go shew these things unto james, and to the brethren . and he departed, and went into another place .
now as soon as it was day, there was no small sti@@ r among the soldiers, what was become of peter .
and when herod had sought for him, and found him not, he exa@@ mined the kee@@ pers, and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from judaea to caesa@@ rea, and there abode .
and herod was high@@ ly disp@@ leased with them of tyre and sid@@ on : but they came with one accord to him, and, having made bla@@ st@@ us the king 's cha@@ mb@@ er@@ la@@ in their friend, desired peace ; because their country was n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed by the king 's country .
and upon a set day herod, ar@@ ra@@ yed in ro@@ y@@ al ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l, sat upon his thr@@ one, and made an or@@ ation unto them .
and the people gave a shou@@ t, saying, it is the voice of a god, and not of a man .
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him, because he gave not god the glory : and he was eaten of wor@@ ms, and gave up the ghost .
but the word of god gre@@ w and multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their mini@@ str@@ y, and took with them john, whose surname was mar@@ k .
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teac@@ he@@ rs ; as barnabas, and si@@ me@@ on that was called ni@@ g@@ er, and lu@@ ci@@ us of cy@@ ren@@ e, and man@@ a@@ en, which had been brought up with herod the tetrar@@ ch, and saul .
as they ministered to the lord, and f@@ as@@ ted, the holy ghost said, se@@ para@@ te me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
and when they had fast@@ ed and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away .
so they, being sent forth by the holy ghost, departed unto sele@@ u@@ ci@@ a ; and from thence they sailed to cyp@@ r@@ us .
and when they were at sa@@ la@@ mi@@ s, they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john to their minister .
and when they had gone through the is@@ le unto pa@@ p@@ ho@@ s, they found a certain sor@@ ce@@ re@@ r, a false prophet, a jew@@ , whose name was bar@@ jesus :
which was with the de@@ pu@@ ty of the country, ser@@ gi@@ us pa@@ ul@@ us, a p@@ ru@@ d@@ ent man ; who called for barnabas and saul, and desired to hear the word of god .
but el@@ y@@ m@@ as the sor@@ ce@@ re@@ r with@@ stood them, seeking to turn away the de@@ pu@@ ty from the faith .
then saul, filled with the holy ghost, set his eyes on him .
and said, o full of all sub@@ ti@@ l@@ ty and all mis@@ chi@@ e@@ f, thou child of the devil, thou ene@@ my of all righteousness, wilt thou not ce@@ ase to perver@@ t the right ways of the lord ?
and now, behold, the hand of the lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mi@@ st and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
then the de@@ pu@@ ty, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the lord .
now when paul and his company loosed from pa@@ p@@ ho@@ s, they came to per@@ g@@ a in pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a : and john depar@@ ting from them returned to jerusalem .
but when they departed from per@@ ga@@ , they came to antioch in pi@@ si@@ di@@ a, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down .
and after the rea@@ ding of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhor@@ tation for the people, say on .
then paul stood up, and beck@@ oning with his hand said, men of israel, and ye that fear god, give au@@ di@@ ence .
the god of this people of israel cho@@ se our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt, and with an high ar@@ m brought he them out of it .
and about the time of forty years suffered he their man@@ ners in the wilderness .
and when he had destro@@ yed seven nations in the land of chan@@ a@@ an, he divided their land to them by lot .
and after that he gave unto them jud@@ ges about the space of four hundred and fif@@ ty years, until sa@@ mu@@ el the prophet .
and afterward they desired a king : and god gave unto them saul the son of ci@@ s, a man of the tri@@ be of b@@ en@@ ja@@ min@@ , by the space of forty years .
and when he had re@@ moved him, he raised up unto them david to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimon@@ y, and said, i have found david the son of jes@@ se, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfi@@ l all my will .
of this man 's seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a sa@@ vi@@ our, jesus :
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
and as john fulfilled his cour@@ se, he said, whom think ye that i am ? i am not he . but, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose .
men and brethren, children of the sto@@ ck of abraham, and whosoever among you fea@@ reth god, to you is the word of this salvation sent .
for they that dwell at jerusalem, and their rul@@ ers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voi@@ ces of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condem@@ ning him .
and though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they pilate that he should be slain .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre .
but god raised him from the dead :
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people .
and we declare unto you glad tid@@ ings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up jesus again ; as it is also written in the second p@@ sal@@ m, thou art my son, this day have i be@@ gotten thee .
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corrup@@ tion, he said on this wise, i will give you the sure mer@@ ci@@ es of david .
wherefore he saith also in another p@@ sal@@ m, thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corrup@@ tion .
for david, after he had served his own generation by the will of god, fell on sle@@ ep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corrup@@ tion :
but he, whom god raised again, saw no corrup@@ tion .
be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins :
and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets ;
behold, ye despi@@ ser@@ s, and wond@@ er, and perish : for i work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you .
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue, the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
now when the con@@ gre@@ ga@@ tion was broken up, many of the jews and re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous pro@@ sel@@ y@@ tes followed paul and barnabas : who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continu@@ e in the grace of god .
and the next sabbath day came al@@ most the whole city together to hear the word of god .
but when the jews saw the multitu@@ des, they were filled with en@@ v@@ y, and spake against those things which were spoken by paul, cont@@ ra@@ di@@ c@@ ting and blasphe@@ m@@ ing .
then paul and barnabas waxed bo@@ ld, and said, it was ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry that the word of god should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves un@@ worthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the gentiles .
for so hath the lord commanded us, saying, i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the en@@ ds of the earth .
and when the gentiles heard this, they were gla@@ d, and glorified the word of the lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
and the word of the lord was publi@@ shed throughout all the region .
but the jews stirred up the devout and honou@@ ra@@ ble women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecu@@ tion against paul and barnabas, and expe@@ lled them out of their coasts .
but they sho@@ ok off the du@@ st of their feet against them, and came unto i@@ con@@ iu@@ m .
and the disciples were filled with jo@@ y, and with the holy ghost .
and it came to pass in i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed .
but the unbelie@@ ving jews stirred up the gentiles, and made their min@@ ds evil af@@ fe@@ cted against the brethren .
long time therefore abode they speaking bold@@ ly in the lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his gra@@ ce, and gran@@ ted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
but the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the jews, and part with the apostles .
and when there was an as@@ sa@@ ult made both of the gentiles, and also of the jews with their rul@@ ers, to use them despi@@ te@@ ful@@ ly, and to stone them ,
they were ware of it, and fled unto ly@@ str@@ a and der@@ be, cities of ly@@ ca@@ oni@@ a, and unto the region that lie@@ th round about :
and there they preached the gospel .
and there sat a certain man at ly@@ stra@@ , im@@ po@@ t@@ ent in his feet, being a cri@@ pp@@ le from his mother 's wo@@ mb, who never had walked :
the same heard paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him, and percei@@ ving that he had faith to be healed ,
said with a loud voice, stand up@@ right on thy feet . and he lea@@ ped and walked .
and when the people saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voi@@ ces, saying in the speech of ly@@ ca@@ oni@@ a, the go@@ ds are come down to us in the li@@ k@@ en@@ ess of men .
and they called barnabas, j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ; and paul, mer@@ cu@@ ri@@ us, because he was the chief spea@@ ke@@ r .
then the priest of j@@ up@@ i@@ ter, which was before their city, brought o@@ x@@ en and gar@@ lan@@ ds unto the ga@@ tes, and would have done sacrifice with the people .
which when the apostles, barnabas and paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out ,
and saying, sirs, why do ye these things ? we also are men of like pas@@ sions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these van@@ i@@ ties unto the living god, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein :
who in times pa@@ st suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us ra@@ in from heaven, and fru@@ it@@ ful seas@@ ons, fi@@ l@@ ling our hearts with fo@@ od and gla@@ dness .
and with these sayings s@@ car@@ ce re@@ strained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, who persuaded the people, and having stoned paul, drew him out of the city, sup@@ pos@@ ing he had been dead .
howbe@@ it, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city : and the next day he departed with barnabas to der@@ be .
and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to ly@@ stra@@ , and to i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, and antioch ,
con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing the souls of the disciples, and exhor@@ ting them to continu@@ e in the faith, and that we must through much tribu@@ lation enter into the kingdom of god .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fast@@ ing, they com@@ men@@ ded them to the lord, on whom they believed .
and after they had passed throughout pi@@ si@@ di@@ a, they came to pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a .
and when they had preached the word in per@@ ga@@ , they went down into at@@ ta@@ li@@ a :
and thence sailed to antio@@ ch, from whence they had been re@@ com@@ men@@ ded to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled .
and when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they re@@ hear@@ sed all that god had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles .
and there they abode long time with the disciples .
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren, and said, except ye be circumci@@ sed after the manner of moses, ye cannot be saved .
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dis@@ sen@@ sion and dispu@@ tation with them, they determined that paul and barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church, they passed through phe@@ ni@@ ce and samaria, decl@@ aring the conver@@ sion of the gentiles : and they ca@@ used great joy unto all the brethren .
and when they were come to jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that god had done with them .
but there rose up certain of the se@@ ct of the pharisees which believed, saying, that it was nee@@ d@@ ful to circumci@@ se them, and to command them to keep the law of moses .
and the apostles and elders came together for to consi@@ der of this matter .
and when there had been much dispu@@ t@@ ing, peter rose up, and said unto them, men and brethren, ye know how that a good while a@@ go god made cho@@ i@@ ce among us, that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospe@@ l, and believe .
and god, which knoweth the hear@@ ts, bare them witness, gi@@ ving them the holy ghost, even as he did unto us ;
and put no di@@ ffe@@ re@@ nce between us and them, puri@@ fying their hearts by faith .
now therefore why tempt ye god, to put a y@@ o@@ ke upon the ne@@ ck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be sa@@ ved, even as they .
then all the multitude kept sil@@ en@@ ce, and gave au@@ di@@ ence to barnabas and paul, decl@@ aring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them .
and after they had held their peace, james answered, saying, men and brethren, hearken unto me :
si@@ me@@ on hath declared how god at the first did vi@@ sit the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name .
and to this agre@@ e the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
after this i will retur@@ n, and will build again the tabernac@@ le of david, which is fallen down ; and i will build again the ru@@ ins thereof, and i will set it up :
that the resi@@ du@@ e of men might seek after the lord, and all the gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the lord, who doeth all these things .
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world .
wherefore my sen@@ t@@ ence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the gentiles are turned to god :
but that we write unto them, that they ab@@ sta@@ in from pol@@ lu@@ tions of i@@ do@@ ls, and from forni@@ ca@@ tion, and from things strang@@ led, and from blood .
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas ; na@@ me@@ ly, judas surnamed bar@@ sa@@ bas and si@@ la@@ s, chief men among the brethren :
and they wrote le@@ tters by them after this manner ; the apostles and elders and brethren send gree@@ ting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syri@@ a and cilici@@ a .
forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, sub@@ ver@@ ting your sou@@ ls, saying, ye must be circumci@@ sed, and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accor@@ d, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
men that have ha@@ zar@@ ded their li@@ ves for the name of our lord jesus christ .
we have sent therefore judas and si@@ la@@ s, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
for it seemed good to the holy ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater bur@@ den than these ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry things ;
that ye ab@@ sta@@ in from me@@ a@@ ts offered to i@@ do@@ ls, and from blood, and from things strang@@ led, and from forni@@ cation : from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well . f@@ are ye well .
so when they were dis@@ mis@@ sed, they came to antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the e@@ pi@@ st@@ le :
which when they had rea@@ d, they rejoiced for the con@@ so@@ lation .
and judas and si@@ la@@ s, being prophets also themselves, exhor@@ ted the brethren with many words, and con@@ fir@@ med them .
and after they had tarried there a sp@@ ac@@ e, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
notwith@@ standing it pleased silas to abide there still .
paul also and barnabas continued in antio@@ ch, teaching and preaching the word of the lord, with many others also .
and some days after paul said unto barnabas, let us go again and vi@@ sit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord, and see how they do .
and barnabas determined to take with them john, whose surname was mar@@ k .
but paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, and went not with them to the work .
and the cont@@ en@@ tion was so sha@@ r@@ p between them, that they departed as@@ under one from the other : and so barnabas took mar@@ k, and sailed unto cyp@@ r@@ us ;
and paul cho@@ se si@@ la@@ s, and departed, being re@@ com@@ men@@ ded by the brethren unto the grace of god .
and he went through syri@@ a and cilici@@ a, con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing the chur@@ ches .
then came he to der@@ be and ly@@ str@@ a : and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named timothe@@ us, the son of a certain woman, which was a jew@@ es@@ s, and believed ; but his father was a gree@@ k :
which was well re@@ por@@ ted of by the brethren that were at ly@@ str@@ a and i@@ con@@ iu@@ m .
him would paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumci@@ sed him because of the jews which were in those qu@@ ar@@ ters : for they knew all that his father was a gree@@ k .
and as they went through the ci@@ ties, they delivered them the de@@ cre@@ es for to ke@@ ep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem .
and so were the chur@@ ches esta@@ bli@@ shed in the faith, and incre@@ ased in number daily .
now when they had gone throughout ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a and the region of ga@@ la@@ ti@@ a, and were for@@ bidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia ,
after they were come to my@@ si@@ a, they as@@ say@@ ed to go into bi@@ th@@ y@@ ni@@ a : but the spirit suffered them not .
and they pas@@ sing by my@@ si@@ a came down to tro@@ as .
and a vision appeared to paul in the night ; there stood a man of macedonia, and prayed him, saying, come over into macedonia, and help us .
and after he had seen the visi@@ on, immediately we en@@ dea@@ v@@ oured to go into macedonia, as@@ sure@@ dly ga@@ ther@@ ing that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
therefore loo@@ sing from tro@@ as, we came with a straight course to sa@@ mo@@ th@@ ra@@ ci@@ a, and the next day to ne@@ apo@@ l@@ is ;
and from thence to phili@@ p@@ pi@@ , which is the chief city of that part of macedonia, and a co@@ lon@@ y : and we were in that city abi@@ ding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a ri@@ ver side, where prayer was won@@ t to be made ; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resor@@ ted thither .
and a certain woman named ly@@ di@@ a, a sel@@ ler of pur@@ ple, of the city of th@@ y@@ a@@ ti@@ ra@@ , which worshipped god, heard us : whose heart the lord opened, that she a@@ tt@@ en@@ ded unto the things which were spoken of paul .
and when she was baptized, and her househo@@ ld, she besought us, saying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord, come into my house, and abide there . and she con@@ strained us .
and it came to pass, as we went to pray@@ er, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of di@@ vin@@ ation met us, which brought her masters much ga@@ in by so@@ o@@ th@@ saying :
the same followed paul and us, and cried, saying, these men are the servants of the most high god, which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and this did she many days . but paul, being grie@@ ved, turned and said to the spirit, i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their ga@@ ins was g@@ one, they caught paul and si@@ la@@ s, and drew them into the marke@@ t@@ place unto the rulers ,
and brought them to the magistra@@ tes, saying, these men, being jews, do excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly trouble our city ,
and teach custo@@ ms, which are not lawful for us to recei@@ ve, neither to ob@@ ser@@ ve, being roman@@ s .
and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistra@@ tes rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them .
and when they had laid many stri@@ pes upon them, they cast them into prison, char@@ ging the ja@@ i@@ l@@ or to keep them sa@@ fe@@ ly :
who, having received such a char@@ ge, thrust them into the in@@ ner prison, and made their feet fast in the sto@@ c@@ ks .
and at mid@@ night paul and silas prayed, and san@@ g p@@ rai@@ ses unto god : and the prison@@ ers heard them .
and suddenly there was a great earth@@ qua@@ ke, so that the founda@@ tions of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one 's b@@ an@@ ds were loosed .
and the kee@@ per of the prison a@@ wa@@ king out of his sle@@ ep, and seeing the prison doors op@@ en, he drew out his s@@ word, and would have killed himself, sup@@ pos@@ ing that the prison@@ ers had been fled .
but paul cried with a loud voice, saying, do thyself no har@@ m : for we are all here .
then he called for a light, and sp@@ ran@@ g in, and came tremb@@ ling, and fell down before paul and silas ,
and brought them out, and said, sirs, what must i do to be saved ?
and they said, believe on the lord jesus christ, and thou shalt be sa@@ ved, and thy house .
and they spake unto him the word of the lord, and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stri@@ pes ; and was baptized, he and all hi@@ s, straightway .
and when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoi@@ ce@@ d, belie@@ ving in god with all his house .
and when it was day, the magistra@@ tes sent the ser@@ je@@ an@@ ts, saying, let those men go .
and the kee@@ per of the prison told this saying to paul, the magistra@@ tes have sent to let you go : now therefore depar@@ t, and go in peace .
but paul said unto them, they have be@@ ate@@ n us openly un@@ condem@@ ned, being roman@@ s, and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out pri@@ vi@@ ly ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fe@@ tch us out .
and the ser@@ je@@ an@@ ts told these words unto the magistra@@ tes : and they fea@@ red, when they heard that they were roman@@ s .
and they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of ly@@ di@@ a : and when they had seen the brethren, they comfor@@ ted them, and departed .
now when they had passed through am@@ phi@@ pol@@ is and apo@@ l@@ loni@@ a, they came to thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , where was a synagogue of the jews :
and paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
open@@ ing and al@@ le@@ g@@ ing, that christ must needs have suffe@@ red, and risen again from the dead ; and that this jesus, whom i preach unto you, is christ .
and some of them believed, and con@@ sor@@ ted with paul and silas ; and of the devout greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few .
but the jews which believed not, moved with en@@ v@@ y, took unto them certain le@@ w@@ d fellow@@ s of the ba@@ se@@ r sor@@ t, and gathered a comp@@ an@@ y, and set all the city on an upro@@ ar, and as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted the house of j@@ as@@ on, and sought to bring them out to the people .
and when they found them not, they drew j@@ as@@ on and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, c@@ ry@@ ing, these that have turned the world up@@ side down are come hither also ;
whom j@@ as@@ on hath received : and these all do contrary to the de@@ cre@@ es of caesar, saying that there is another king, one jesus .
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things .
and when they had taken secu@@ ri@@ ty of j@@ as@@ on, and of the o@@ ther, they let them go .
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto be@@ rea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews .
these were more no@@ ble than those in thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , in that they received the word with all rea@@ d@@ in@@ ess of min@@ d, and se@@ ar@@ ched the scriptures dai@@ ly, whether those things were so .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honou@@ ra@@ ble women which were gree@@ ks, and of men, not a few .
but when the jews of thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ c@@ a had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at be@@ rea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea : but silas and timothe@@ us abode there still .
and they that con@@ du@@ cted paul brought him unto a@@ the@@ ns : and recei@@ ving a commandment unto silas and timothe@@ us for to come to him with all spe@@ ed, they departed .
now while paul waited for them at a@@ then@@ s, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city who@@ l@@ ly given to i@@ do@@ la@@ tr@@ y .
therefore dispu@@ ted he in the synagogue with the jews, and with the devout per@@ s@@ ons, and in the marke@@ t daily with them that met with him .
then certain phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phe@@ rs of the e@@ pi@@ cu@@ re@@ ans, and of the sto@@ i@@ ck@@ s, en@@ coun@@ tered him . and some said, what will this b@@ ab@@ b@@ ler say ? other so@@ me, he see@@ meth to be a se@@ tter forth of stran@@ ge go@@ ds : because he preached unto them jesus, and the resurrection .
and they took him, and brought him unto a@@ re@@ o@@ pa@@ g@@ us, saying, may we know what this new doctr@@ in@@ e, whereof thou spea@@ k@@ est, is ?
for thou bring@@ est certain stran@@ ge things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .

then paul stood in the midst of mar@@ s ' hi@@ ll, and said, ye men of a@@ then@@ s, i perceive that in all things ye are to@@ o super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous .
for as i passed by, and beheld your de@@ vo@@ tions, i found an al@@ ta@@ r with this in@@ scri@@ pti@@ on, to the unknown god . whom therefore ye i@@ gn@@ or@@ an@@ tly wor@@ ship, him declare i unto you .
god that made the world and all things there@@ in, seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth, dwel@@ leth not in tem@@ ple@@ s made with hands ;
neither is worshipped with men 's hands, as though he nee@@ ded any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and brea@@ th, and all things ;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appoin@@ ted, and the b@@ oun@@ ds of their ha@@ bi@@ tation ;
that they should seek the lord, if ha@@ ply they might fee@@ l after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us :
for in him we li@@ ve, and mo@@ ve, and have our being ; as certain also of your own po@@ e@@ ts have said, for we are also his off@@ sp@@ ring .
forasmuch then as we are the off@@ sp@@ ring of god, we ought not to think that the go@@ d@@ head is like unto go@@ ld, or sil@@ ver, or st@@ one, gra@@ ven by art and man 's devi@@ ce .
and the times of this i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance god win@@ ked at ; but now comman@@ deth all men every where to repent :
because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given as@@ sur@@ ance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead .
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked : and others said, we will hear thee again of this matter .
so paul departed from among them .
howbeit certain men c@@ la@@ ve unto him, and believed : among the which was di@@ on@@ y@@ si@@ us the a@@ re@@ o@@ pa@@ gi@@ te, and a woman named da@@ mar@@ is, and others with them .
after these things paul departed from a@@ then@@ s, and came to cor@@ in@@ th ;
and found a certain jew named a@@ qui@@ la@@ , born in pon@@ tus, la@@ te@@ ly come from i@@ tal@@ y, with his wife pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a ; and came unto them .
and because he was of the same cra@@ f@@ t, he abode with them, and wrought : for by their o@@ c@@ c@@ up@@ ation they were ten@@ t@@ ma@@ k@@ ers .
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabba@@ th, and persuaded the jews and the greeks .
and when silas and timothe@@ us were come from macedonia, paul was pre@@ ssed in the spirit, and testi@@ fied to the jews that jesus was christ .
and when they op@@ po@@ sed themselves, and blasphe@@ med, he sho@@ ok his rai@@ ment, and said unto them, your blood be upon your own hea@@ ds ; i am clean ; from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles .
and he departed thence, and entered into a certain man 's house, named ju@@ st@@ us, one that worshipped god, whose house jo@@ ined hard to the synagogue .
and cri@@ sp@@ us, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the lord with all his house ; and many of the cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans hearing believed, and were baptized .
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a visi@@ on, be not afrai@@ d, but speak, and hold not thy peace :
for i am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hu@@ r@@ t thee : for i have much people in this city .
and he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of god among them .
and when ga@@ l@@ li@@ o was the de@@ pu@@ ty of acha@@ i@@ a, the jews made in@@ surre@@ ction with one accord against paul, and brought him to the judgment seat ,
saying, this fellow persua@@ deth men to worship god contrary to the law .
and when paul was now about to open his mouth, ga@@ l@@ li@@ o said unto the jews, if it were a matter of wr@@ ong or wicked le@@ w@@ d@@ ness, o ye jews, reason would that i should bear with you :
but if it be a question of words and na@@ mes, and of your law, look ye to it ; for i will be no judge of such mat@@ ters .
and he dra@@ ve them from the judgment seat .
then all the greeks took so@@ s@@ then@@ es, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat . and ga@@ l@@ li@@ o ca@@ red for none of those things .
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into syri@@ a, and with him pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a and a@@ qui@@ l@@ a ; having shor@@ n his head in cen@@ ch@@ rea : for he had a vo@@ w .
and he came to ephe@@ sus, and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the jews .
when they desired him to tarry lon@@ ger time with them, he con@@ sen@@ ted not ;
but bade them fa@@ re@@ well, saying, i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem : but i will return again unto you, if god will . and he sailed from ephe@@ sus .
and when he had lan@@ ded at caesa@@ rea, and gone up, and salu@@ ted the church, he went down to antioch .
and after he had sp@@ ent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of ga@@ la@@ ti@@ a and ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a in or@@ d@@ er, streng@@ the@@ ning all the disciples .
and a certain jew named apo@@ llo@@ s, born at alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a, an e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ent man, and mighty in the scriptu@@ res, came to ephe@@ sus .
this man was inst@@ ru@@ cted in the way of the lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in the spirit, he spake and taught di@@ ligen@@ tly the things of the lord, knowing only the baptism of john .
and he began to speak bold@@ ly in the synagogue : whom when a@@ qui@@ l@@ a and pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a had heard, they took him unto them, and ex@@ p@@ ounded unto him the way of god more perfec@@ tly .
and when he was di@@ spo@@ sed to pass into acha@@ i@@ a, the brethren wro@@ te, exhor@@ ting the disciples to receive him : who, when he was come, hel@@ ped them much which had believed through grace :
for he migh@@ ti@@ ly con@@ vin@@ ced the jews, and that publi@@ ck@@ ly, she@@ wing by the scriptures that jesus was christ .
and it came to pass, that, while apo@@ llo@@ s was at cor@@ in@@ th, paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephe@@ sus : and fin@@ ding certain disciples ,
he said unto them, have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost .
and he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized ? and they said, unto john 's baptism .
then said paul, john verily baptized with the baptism of repen@@ tan@@ ce, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on christ jesus .
when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
and when paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongu@@ es, and prophesi@@ ed .
and all the men were about twelve .
and he went into the synagogue, and spake bold@@ ly for the space of three months, dispu@@ ting and persua@@ ding the things concerning the kingdom of god .
but when divers were har@@ den@@ ed, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and se@@ para@@ ted the disciples, dispu@@ ting daily in the s@@ cho@@ ol of one ty@@ ran@@ n@@ us .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus, both jews and greeks .
and god wrought spe@@ ci@@ al miracles by the hands of paul :
so that from his body were brought unto the sick han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ e@@ f@@ s or ap@@ r@@ ons, and the disea@@ ses departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them .
then certain of the v@@ aga@@ bon@@ d jews, ex@@ or@@ ci@@ st@@ s, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus, saying, we ad@@ ju@@ re you by jesus whom paul prea@@ che@@ th .
and there were seven sons of one s@@ ce@@ v@@ a, a jew@@ , and chief of the priests, which did so .
and the evil spirit answered and said, jesus i know, and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
and the man in whom the evil spirit was lea@@ ped on them, and over@@ came them, and pre@@ vai@@ led against them, so that they fled out of that house na@@ ked and w@@ ounded .
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwel@@ ling at ephe@@ sus ; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the lord jesus was mag@@ ni@@ fied .
and many that believed came, and confes@@ sed, and shewed their deeds .
many of them also which used cu@@ ri@@ ous ar@@ ts brought their boo@@ ks together, and bur@@ ned them before all men : and they counted the pri@@ ce of them, and found it fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
so migh@@ ti@@ ly gre@@ w the word of god and pre@@ vai@@ led .
after these things were en@@ ded, paul purpo@@ sed in the spirit, when he had passed through macedoni@@ a and acha@@ i@@ a, to go to jerusalem, saying, after i have been there, i must also see ro@@ me .
so he sent into macedoni@@ a two of them that ministered unto him, timothe@@ us and er@@ ast@@ us ; but he himself sta@@ yed in asia for a season .
and the same time there arose no small sti@@ r about that way .
for a certain man named de@@ me@@ tri@@ us, a sil@@ ver@@ smi@@ th, which made silver sh@@ rin@@ es for di@@ an@@ a, brought no small ga@@ in unto the cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men ;
whom he called together with the wor@@ k@@ men of like o@@ c@@ c@@ up@@ a@@ tion, and said, sirs, ye know that by this cra@@ ft we have our we@@ al@@ th .
moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at ephe@@ sus, but al@@ most throughout all asi@@ a, this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no go@@ ds, which are made with hands :
so that not only this our cra@@ ft is in danger to be set at n@@ ought ; but also that the temple of the great go@@ d@@ des@@ s di@@ an@@ a should be despi@@ sed, and her mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cen@@ ce should be destro@@ ye@@ d, whom all asia and the world worshi@@ p@@ peth .
and when they heard these sayings, they were full of wra@@ th, and cried out, saying, great is di@@ an@@ a of the ephe@@ si@@ ans .
and the whole city was filled with con@@ fu@@ sion : and having caught ga@@ i@@ us and ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us, men of macedonia, paul 's comp@@ ani@@ ons in tra@@ ve@@ l, they ru@@ shed with one accord into the the@@ at@@ re .
and when paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not .
and certain of the chief of asi@@ a, which were his frien@@ ds, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not ad@@ ven@@ ture himself into the the@@ at@@ re .
some therefore cried one thing, and some another : for the assemb@@ ly was con@@ fu@@ sed : and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
and they drew alex@@ an@@ der out of the multitude, the jews pu@@ tting him for@@ ward . and alex@@ an@@ der beck@@ oned with the hand, and would have made his de@@ f@@ ence unto the people .
but when they knew that he was a jew@@ , all with one voice about the space of two hou@@ rs cried out, great is di@@ an@@ a of the ephe@@ si@@ ans .
and when the tow@@ n@@ c@@ ler@@ k had appe@@ ased the people, he said, ye men of ephe@@ sus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephe@@ si@@ ans is a worshi@@ p@@ per of the great go@@ d@@ des@@ s di@@ an@@ a, and of the image which fell down from j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ?
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken again@@ st, ye ought to be qui@@ e@@ t, and to do nothing ra@@ sh@@ ly .
for ye have brought hither these men, which are neither ro@@ b@@ b@@ ers of chur@@ che@@ s, nor yet blasphe@@ m@@ ers of your go@@ d@@ des@@ s .
wherefore if de@@ me@@ tri@@ us, and the cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is op@@ en, and there are de@@ pu@@ ties : let them im@@ ple@@ ad one another .
but if ye enquire any thing concerning other mat@@ ter@@ s, it shall be determined in a lawful assemb@@ ly .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's upro@@ ar, there being no cause where@@ by we may give an ac@@ coun@@ t of this con@@ course .
and when he had thus spoken, he dis@@ mis@@ sed the assemb@@ ly .
and after the upro@@ ar was cea@@ sed, paul called unto him the disciples, and e@@ mb@@ rac@@ ed them, and departed for to go into macedoni@@ a .
and when he had gone over those par@@ ts, and had given them much exhor@@ tation, he came into gree@@ ce ,
and there abode three month@@ s . and when the jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into syri@@ a, he purpo@@ sed to return through macedoni@@ a .
and there accomp@@ ani@@ ed him into asia so@@ pa@@ ter of be@@ rea ; and of the thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ans, ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us and se@@ c@@ und@@ us ; and ga@@ i@@ us of der@@ be, and timothe@@ us ; and of asi@@ a, ty@@ chi@@ c@@ us and tro@@ phi@@ m@@ us .
these going before tarried for us at tro@@ as .
and we sailed away from phili@@ pp@@ i after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to tro@@ as in five days ; where we abode seven days .
and upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to brea@@ k bread, paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until mid@@ night .
and there were many li@@ gh@@ ts in the upper cha@@ mb@@ er, where they were gathered together .
and there sat in a win@@ dow a certain young man named e@@ u@@ ty@@ ch@@ us, being fallen into a de@@ ep sleep : and as paul was long prea@@ chi@@ ng, he sun@@ k down with sle@@ ep, and fell down from the third lo@@ f@@ t, and was taken up dead .
and paul went down, and fell on him, and e@@ mb@@ rac@@ ing him said, trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
when he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and ea@@ t@@ en, and talked a long while, even till brea@@ k of day, so he departed .
and they brought the young man a@@ li@@ ve, and were not a little comfor@@ ted .
and we went before to ship, and sailed unto as@@ so@@ s, there int@@ en@@ ding to take in paul : for so had he appoin@@ ted, min@@ ding himself to go af@@ o@@ ot .
and when he met with us at as@@ so@@ s, we took him in, and came to mi@@ ty@@ len@@ e .
and we sailed thence, and came the next day over against chi@@ o@@ s ; and the next day we ar@@ ri@@ ved at sa@@ mo@@ s, and tarried at tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ u@@ m ; and the next day we came to mi@@ le@@ tus .
for paul had determined to sail by ephe@@ sus, because he would not sp@@ end the time in asia : for he ha@@ s@@ ted, if it were possible for him, to be at jerusalem the day of p@@ ente@@ co@@ st .
and from mi@@ le@@ tus he sent to ephe@@ sus, and called the elders of the church .
and when they were come to him, he said unto them, ye know, from the first day that i came into asi@@ a, after what manner i have been with you at all seas@@ ons ,
ser@@ ving the lord with all hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty of min@@ d, and with many te@@ ar@@ s, and temp@@ ta@@ tions, which be@@ fell me by the lying in wait of the jews :
and how i kept back nothing that was profi@@ table unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publi@@ ck@@ ly, and from house to house ,
testi@@ fying both to the jews, and also to the gree@@ ks, repentance toward god, and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
and now, behold, i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall be@@ fall me there :
save that the holy ghost witnes@@ seth in every city, saying that bon@@ ds and affli@@ c@@ tions abide me .
but none of these things move me, neither coun@@ t i my life dea@@ r unto myself, so that i might fin@@ ish my course with jo@@ y, and the mini@@ str@@ y, which i have received of the lord jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of god .
and now, behold, i know that ye all, among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god, shall see my face no more .
wherefore i take you to record this day, that i am pu@@ re from the blood of all men .
for i have not s@@ hun@@ ned to declare unto you all the counsel of god .
take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flo@@ ck, over the which the holy ghost hath made you over@@ se@@ ers, to fe@@ ed the church of god, which he hath pur@@ cha@@ sed with his own blood .
for i know this, that after my depar@@ ting shall grie@@ v@@ ous wol@@ ves enter in among you, not sp@@ aring the flo@@ ck .
also of your own sel@@ ves shall men arise, speaking perver@@ se things, to draw away disciples after them .
therefore wat@@ ch, and reme@@ mb@@ er, that by the space of three years i ce@@ ased not to war@@ n every one night and day with te@@ ar@@ s .
and now, brethren, i comm@@ end you to god, and to the word of his gra@@ ce, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sancti@@ fied .
i have cove@@ ted no man 's sil@@ ver, or go@@ ld, or ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l .
yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my ne@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ties, and to them that were with me .
i have shewed you all things, how that so lab@@ our@@ ing ye ought to sup@@ port the we@@ a@@ k, and to remember the words of the lord jesus, how he said, it is more blessed to give than to receive .
and when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all .
and they all wept so@@ re, and fell on paul 's ne@@ ck, and kis@@ sed him ,
sorrow@@ ing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more . and they accomp@@ ani@@ ed him unto the ship .
and it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had laun@@ che@@ d, we came with a straight course unto co@@ o@@ s, and the day following unto r@@ ho@@ des, and from thence unto pa@@ tar@@ a :
and fin@@ ding a ship sai@@ ling over unto phe@@ ni@@ ci@@ a, we went abo@@ ard, and set forth .
now when we had dis@@ co@@ vered cyp@@ ru@@ s, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into syri@@ a, and lan@@ ded at tyre : for there the ship was to un@@ la@@ de her bur@@ den .
and fin@@ ding disciples, we tarried there seven days : who said to paul through the spirit, that he should not go up to jerusalem .
and when we had accompli@@ shed those days, we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way, with wi@@ ves and children, till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the sho@@ re, and prayed .
and when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship ; and they returned home again .
and when we had fin@@ ished our course from ty@@ re, we came to p@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ is, and salu@@ ted the brethren, and abode with them one day .
and the next day we that were of paul 's company departed, and came unto caesarea : and we entered into the house of philip the e@@ van@@ ge@@ li@@ st, which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and the same man had four daugh@@ ter@@ s, virg@@ in@@ s, which did prophe@@ sy .
and as we tarried there many days, there came down from judaea a certain prophet, named aga@@ bu@@ s .
and when he was come unto us, he took paul 's gir@@ dle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, thus saith the holy ghost, so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that ow@@ ne@@ th this gir@@ dle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles .
and when we heard these things, both w@@ e, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
then paul answered, what mean ye to weep and to brea@@ k mine heart ? for i am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus .
and when he would not be persua@@ ded, we cea@@ sed, saying, the will of the lord be done .
and after those days we took up our car@@ ri@@ a@@ ges, and went up to jerusalem .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesa@@ rea, and brought with them one m@@ n@@ as@@ on of cyp@@ ru@@ s, an old disciple, with whom we should lo@@ dge .
and when we were come to jerusalem, the brethren received us gla@@ dly .
and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
and when he had salu@@ ted them, he declared par@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his mini@@ st@@ ry .
and when they heard it, they glorified the lord, and said unto him, thou se@@ est, brother, how many thous@@ an@@ ds of jews there are which believe ; and they are all ze@@ al@@ ous of the law :
and they are infor@@ med of thee, that thou teac@@ hest all the jews which are among the gentiles to for@@ sake moses, saying that they ought not to circumci@@ se their children, neither to walk after the custo@@ ms .
what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vo@@ w on them ;
them ta@@ ke, and puri@@ fy thyself with them, and be at char@@ ges with them, that they may sha@@ ve their hea@@ ds : and all may know that those things, whereof they were infor@@ med concerning thee, are nothing ; but that thou thyself also wal@@ kest or@@ der@@ ly, and ke@@ ep@@ est the law .
as touching the gentiles which believe, we have written and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that they ob@@ serve no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to i@@ do@@ ls, and from blood, and from strang@@ led, and from forni@@ cation .
then paul took the men, and the next day puri@@ fying himself with them entered into the temple, to signi@@ fy the accompli@@ sh@@ ment of the days of puri@@ fi@@ ca@@ tion, until that an off@@ ering should be offered for every one of them .
and when the seven days were al@@ most en@@ ded, the jews which were of asi@@ a, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him ,
crying out, men of israel, help : this is the man, that teac@@ he@@ th all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place : and further brought greeks also into the temple, and hath pol@@ lu@@ ted this holy place .

and all the city was mo@@ ved, and the people ran together : and they took paul, and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
and as they went about to kill him, tid@@ ings came unto the chief captain of the b@@ and, that all jerusalem was in an upro@@ ar .
who immediately took soldiers and centuri@@ ons, and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left bea@@ ting of paul .
then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two cha@@ ins ; and de@@ man@@ ded who he was, and what he had done .
and some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude : and when he could not know the cer@@ tain@@ ty for the tu@@ mul@@ t, he commanded him to be carried into the cast@@ le .
and when he came upon the sta@@ i@@ rs, so it was, that he was bor@@ ne of the soldiers for the viol@@ ence of the people .
for the multitude of the people followed af@@ ter, c@@ ry@@ ing, away with him .
and as paul was to be led into the cast@@ le, he said unto the chief cap@@ tain, may i speak unto thee ? who said, canst thou speak gree@@ k ?
art not thou that egy@@ pti@@ an, which before these days ma@@ dest an upro@@ ar, and le@@ d@@ dest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murde@@ rers ?
but paul said, i am a man which am a jew of tar@@ sus, a city in cilici@@ a, a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of no mean city : and, i besee@@ ch thee, suffer me to speak unto the people .
and when he had given him li@@ cen@@ ce, paul stood on the sta@@ i@@ rs, and beck@@ oned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ en@@ ce, he spake unto them in the hebre@@ w tongu@@ e, saying ,
men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my de@@ f@@ ence which i make now unto you .

i am verily a man which am a jew@@ , born in tar@@ sus, a city in cilici@@ a, yet brought up in this city at the feet of ga@@ ma@@ lie@@ l, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was ze@@ al@@ ous toward god, as ye all are this day .
and i persecuted this way unto the death, b@@ in@@ ding and deli@@ ver@@ ing into pri@@ sons both men and women .
as also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the esta@@ te of the elders : from whom also i received le@@ tters unto the brethren, and went to damasc@@ us, to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem, for to be p@@ un@@ ished .
and it came to pass, that, as i made my journey, and was come nigh unto damascus about no@@ on, suddenly there sh@@ one from heaven a great light round about me .
and i fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ?
and i answered, who art thou, lord ? and he said unto me, i am jesus of nazareth, whom thou persecutest .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and i said, what shall i do, lord ? and the lord said unto me, arise, and go into damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and when i could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, i came into damascus .
and one anani@@ as, a devout man according to the law, having a good re@@ port of all the jews which dwelt there ,
came unto me, and stoo@@ d, and said unto me, brother saul, receive thy sight . and the same hour i looked up upon him .
and he said, the god of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that just one, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and now why tar@@ ri@@ est thou ? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the lord .
and it came to pass, that, when i was come again to jerusalem, even while i prayed in the temple, i was in a tr@@ ance ;
and saw him saying unto me, make ha@@ ste@@ , and get thee quick@@ ly out of jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
and i said, lord, they know that i im@@ pris@@ oned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
and when the blood of thy mar@@ ty@@ r stephe@@ n was shed, i also was standing by, and con@@ sen@@ ting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
and he said unto me, depart : for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles .
and they gave him au@@ di@@ ence unto this word, and then lifted up their voi@@ ces, and said, away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not f@@ it that he should live .
and as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw du@@ st into the air ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the cast@@ le, and bade that he should be exa@@ mined by scour@@ ging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with th@@ on@@ g@@ s, paul said unto the centurion that stood by, is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a ro@@ man, and un@@ condemned ?
when the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief cap@@ tain, saying, take heed what thou doest : for this man is a ro@@ man .
then the chief captain came, and said unto him, tell me, art thou a ro@@ man ? he said, ye@@ a .
and the chief captain answered, with a great su@@ m ob@@ ta@@ ined i this fre@@ e@@ dom . and paul said, but i was free born .
then straightway they departed from him which should have exa@@ mined him : and the chief captain also was afrai@@ d, after he knew that he was a ro@@ man, and because he had bound him .
on the morrow, because he would have known the cer@@ tain@@ ty wherefore he was accused of the jews, he loosed him from his b@@ and@@ s, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appe@@ ar, and brought paul down, and set him before them .
and paul, ear@@ nes@@ tly beholding the council, said, men and brethren, i have li@@ ved in all good cons@@ ci@@ ence before god until this day .
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
then said paul unto him, god shall smite thee, thou whi@@ ted w@@ all : for si@@ tt@@ est thou to judge me after the law, and command@@ est me to be smi@@ tten contrary to the law ?
and they that stood by said, re@@ vi@@ lest thou god 's high priest ?
then said paul, i wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest : for it is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadduce@@ es, and the other pharisees, he cried out in the council, men and brethren, i am a pharise@@ e, the son of a pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question .
and when he had so said, there arose a dis@@ sen@@ sion between the pharisees and the sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
for the sadducees say that there is no resurre@@ ction, neither ange@@ l, nor spirit : but the pharisees confess both .
and there arose a great c@@ ry : and the scribes that were of the pharisees ' part arose, and st@@ ro@@ ve, saying, we find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fi@@ ght against god .
and when there arose a great dis@@ sen@@ sion, the chief cap@@ tain, fe@@ aring lest paul should have been p@@ ul@@ led in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by for@@ ce from among them, and to bring him into the cast@@ le .
and the night following the lord stood by him, and said, be of good che@@ er, paul : for as thou hast testi@@ fied of me in jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at ro@@ me .
and when it was day, certain of the jews b@@ an@@ ded together, and bound themselves under a cur@@ se, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul .
and they were more than forty which had made this con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y .
and they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, we have bound our@@ sel@@ ves under a great cur@@ se, that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul .
now therefore ye with the council signi@@ fy to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfec@@ tly concerning him : and w@@ e, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him .
and when paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wa@@ it, he went and entered into the cast@@ le, and told paul .
then paul called one of the centuri@@ ons unto him, and said, bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him, and brought him to the chief cap@@ tain, and said, paul the prison@@ er called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside private@@ ly, and asked him, what is that thou hast to tell me ?
and he said, the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire some@@ what of him more perfec@@ tly .
but do not thou y@@ i@@ e@@ ld unto them : for there li@@ e in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oa@@ th, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee .
so the chief captain then let the young man depar@@ t, and charged him, see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
and he called unto him two centuri@@ ons, saying, make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesa@@ rea, and hor@@ se@@ men thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and t@@ en, and spe@@ ar@@ men two hund@@ red, at the third hour of the night ;
and pro@@ vi@@ de them be@@ ast@@ s, that they may set paul on, and bring him sa@@ f@@ e unto felix the governor .
and he wrote a le@@ tter after this manner :
c@@ lau@@ di@@ us ly@@ sias unto the most exce@@ ll@@ ent governor felix sen@@ deth gree@@ ting .
this man was taken of the jews, and should have been killed of them : then came i with an ar@@ m@@ y, and re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed him, having understood that he was a ro@@ man .
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, i brought him forth into their council :
whom i perceived to be accused of questi@@ ons of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bon@@ ds .
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man, i sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accu@@ sers also to say before thee what they had against him . fa@@ re@@ well .
then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took paul, and brought him by night to anti@@ pa@@ tr@@ is .
on the morrow they left the hor@@ se@@ men to go with him, and returned to the cast@@ le :
who, when they came to caesarea and delivered the e@@ pi@@ st@@ le to the gover@@ n@@ or, presen@@ ted paul also before him .
and when the governor had read the le@@ t@@ ter, he asked of what pro@@ vin@@ ce he was . and when he understood that he was of cilici@@ a ;
i will hear thee, said he, when thine accu@@ sers are also come . and he commanded him to be kept in herod 's judgment ha@@ ll .
and after five days ananias the high priest descen@@ ded with the elders, and with a certain or@@ at@@ or named ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us, who infor@@ med the governor against paul .
and when he was called forth, ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us began to accuse him, saying, seeing that by thee we en@@ joy great qui@@ e@@ t@@ ness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy pro@@ vi@@ den@@ ce ,
we ac@@ ce@@ pt it al@@ ways, and in all places, most no@@ ble feli@@ x@@ , with all than@@ k@@ ful@@ ness .
notwith@@ standing, that i be not further te@@ di@@ ous unto thee, i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy cle@@ men@@ cy a few words .
for we have found this man a p@@ esti@@ l@@ ent fello@@ w, and a mo@@ ver of se@@ dition among all the jews throughout the world, and a r@@ ing@@ lea@@ der of the se@@ ct of the naza@@ re@@ ne@@ s :
who also hath gone about to pro@@ f@@ an@@ e the temple : whom we too@@ k, and would have judged according to our law .
but the chief captain ly@@ sias came upon us, and with great viol@@ ence took him away out of our hands ,
comman@@ ding his accu@@ sers to come unto thee : by exa@@ min@@ ing of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him .
and the jews also as@@ s@@ ente@@ d, saying that these things were so .
then paul, after that the governor had beck@@ oned unto him to speak, answered, forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, i do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
because that thou mayest under@@ st@@ and, that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship .
and they neither found me in the temple dispu@@ ting with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city :
neither can they pro@@ ve the things whereof they now accuse me .
but this i confess unto thee, that after the way which they call here@@ sy, so worship i the god of my fathers, belie@@ ving all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
and have hope toward god, which they themselves also al@@ lo@@ w, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust .
and here@@ in do i exercise myself, to have always a cons@@ ci@@ ence vo@@ id to off@@ ence toward god, and toward men .
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation, and off@@ er@@ ings .
where@@ upon certain jews from asia found me puri@@ fied in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tu@@ mul@@ t .
who ought to have been here before thee, and ob@@ je@@ c@@ t, if they had ought against me .
or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil do@@ ing in me, while i stood before the council ,
except it be for this one voice, that i cried standing among them, touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day .
and when felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he de@@ fer@@ red them, and said, when ly@@ sias the chief captain shall come down, i will know the uttermost of your matter .
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul, and to let him have liber@@ ty, and that he should forbid none of his ac@@ qua@@ int@@ ance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days, when felix came with his wife d@@ ru@@ sil@@ la@@ , which was a jew@@ es@@ s, he sent for paul, and heard him concerning the faith in christ .
and as he reasoned of righteousness, tem@@ per@@ an@@ ce, and judgment to come, felix tremb@@ led, and answered, go thy way for this time ; when i have a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent seas@@ on, i will call for thee .
he ho@@ ped also that money should have been given him of paul, that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er, and comm@@ un@@ ed with him .
but after two years por@@ ci@@ us festus came into felix ' room : and feli@@ x@@ , willing to shew the jews a ple@@ asu@@ re, left paul bound .
now when festus was come into the pro@@ vin@@ ce, after three days he as@@ cen@@ ded from caesarea to jerusalem .
then the high priest and the chief of the jews infor@@ med him against paul, and besought him ,
and desired fav@@ our against him, that he would send for him to jerusalem, la@@ ying wait in the way to kill him .
but festus answered, that paul should be kept at caesa@@ rea, and that he himself would depart shor@@ tly thither .
let them therefore, said he, which among you are ab@@ le, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wi@@ c@@ ke@@ dness in him .
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought .
and when he was come, the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grie@@ v@@ ous com@@ pla@@ ints against paul, which they could not pro@@ ve .
while he answered for himself, neither against the law of the jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against caesar, have i offended any thing at all .
but fes@@ tus, willing to do the jews a ple@@ asu@@ re, answered paul, and said, wilt thou go up to jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me ?
then said paul, i stand at caesar 's judgment se@@ at, where i ought to be judged : to the jews have i done no wr@@ on@@ g, as thou very well knowest .
for if i be an offen@@ d@@ er, or have committed any thing worthy of death, i re@@ f@@ use not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them . i appea@@ l unto caesar .
then fes@@ tus, when he had con@@ fer@@ red with the council, answered, hast thou appe@@ aled unto caesar ? unto caesar shalt thou go .
and after certain days king agri@@ ppa and ber@@ ni@@ ce came unto caesarea to salu@@ te festus .
and when they had been there many days, festus declared paul 's cause unto the king, saying, there is a certain man left in bon@@ ds by felix :
about who@@ m, when i was at jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the jews infor@@ med me, desiring to have judgment against him .
to whom i answered, it is not the manner of the roman@@ s to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accu@@ sers face to face, and have li@@ cen@@ ce to answer for himself concerning the cri@@ me laid against him .
therefore, when they were come hi@@ ther, without any de@@ lay on the morrow i sat on the judgment se@@ at, and commanded the man to be brought forth .
against whom when the accu@@ sers stood up, they brought none accu@@ sa@@ tion of such things as i suppo@@ sed :
but had certain questi@@ ons against him of their own super@@ sti@@ tion, and of one jesus, which was dead, whom paul af@@ fir@@ med to be a@@ live .
and because i doub@@ ted of such manner of questi@@ ons, i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem, and there be judged of these mat@@ ters .
but when paul had appe@@ aled to be re@@ served unto the hearing of au@@ gu@@ st@@ us, i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar .
then agri@@ ppa said unto fes@@ tus, i would also hear the man myself . to morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him .
and on the morrow, when agri@@ ppa was come, and ber@@ ni@@ ce, with great po@@ m@@ p, and was entered into the place of hear@@ ing, with the chief cap@@ tains, and prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l men of the city, at festus ' commandment paul was brought forth .
and festus said, king agri@@ ppa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the jews have de@@ al@@ t with me, both at jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any lon@@ ger .
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appe@@ aled to au@@ gu@@ st@@ us, i have determined to send him .
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord . wherefore i have brought him forth before you, and spe@@ ci@@ al@@ ly before thee, o king agri@@ ppa, that, after exa@@ min@@ ation ha@@ d, i might have some@@ what to write .
for it see@@ meth to me un@@ reas@@ on@@ able to send a prison@@ er, and not with@@ al to signi@@ fy the cri@@ mes laid against him .
then agri@@ ppa said unto paul, thou art per@@ mi@@ tted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself :
i think myself ha@@ pp@@ y, king agri@@ ppa, because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews :
es@@ pe@@ ci@@ al@@ ly because i know thee to be ex@@ per@@ t in all custo@@ ms and questi@@ ons which are among the jews : wherefore i besee@@ ch thee to hear me pa@@ ti@@ en@@ tly .
my manner of life from my you@@ th, which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem, know all the jews ;
which knew me from the begin@@ ning, if they would testi@@ f@@ y, that after the most strai@@ test se@@ ct of our re@@ li@@ gion i li@@ ved a pharisee .
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god, unto our fathers :
unto which promise our twelve tri@@ bes, in@@ stan@@ tly ser@@ ving god day and night, hope to come . for which hope 's sake, king agri@@ ppa, i am accused of the jews .
why should it be thought a thing incre@@ di@@ ble with you, that god should raise the dead ?
i verily thought with myself, that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
which thing i also did in jerusalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did i shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death, i gave my voice against them .
and i p@@ un@@ ished them of@@ t in every synagogue, and com@@ pe@@ lled them to blasphe@@ me ; and being excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly ma@@ d against them, i persecuted them even unto stran@@ ge cities .
where@@ upon as i went to damascus with authority and commi@@ s@@ sion from the chief priests ,
at mid@@ day, o king, i saw in the way a light from heaven, above the bri@@ ght@@ ness of the sun@@ , shi@@ ning round about me and them which journe@@ yed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the earth, i heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the hebre@@ w tongu@@ e, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to ki@@ ck against the pri@@ c@@ ks .
and i said, who art thou, lord ? and he said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
but rise, and stand upon thy feet : for i have appeared unto thee for this purpo@@ se, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast se@@ en, and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee ;
deli@@ ver@@ ing thee from the people, and from the gentiles, unto whom now i send thee ,
to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto god, that they may receive forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins, and inheritance among them which are sancti@@ fied by faith that is in me .
where@@ up@@ on, o king agri@@ ppa, i was not di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent unto the heavenly vision :
but shewed first unto them of damasc@@ us, and at jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of judaea, and then to the gentiles, that they should repent and turn to god, and do works meet for repentance .
for these ca@@ u@@ ses the jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me .
having therefore ob@@ ta@@ ined help of god, i continu@@ e unto this day, witnes@@ sing both to small and grea@@ t, saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come :
that christ should suf@@ f@@ er, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the gentiles .
and as he thus spake for himself, festus said with a loud voice, paul, thou art beside thyself ; much lear@@ ning doth make thee ma@@ d .
but he said, i am not ma@@ d, most no@@ ble festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and so@@ ber@@ ness .
for the king knoweth of these things, before whom also i speak fre@@ e@@ ly : for i am persuaded that none of these things are hi@@ d@@ den from him ; for this thing was not done in a cor@@ ner .
king agri@@ ppa, believest thou the prophets ? i know that thou believest .
then agri@@ ppa said unto paul, al@@ most thou persu@@ ad@@ est me to be a chri@@ sti@@ an .
and paul said, i would to god, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both al@@ mo@@ st, and al@@ together such as i am, except these bon@@ ds .
and when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the gover@@ n@@ or, and ber@@ ni@@ ce, and they that sat with them :
and when they were gone asi@@ de, they talked between themselves, saying, this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bon@@ ds .
then said agri@@ ppa unto fes@@ tus, this man might have been set at liber@@ ty, if he had not appe@@ aled unto caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail into i@@ tal@@ y, they delivered paul and certain other prison@@ ers unto one named ju@@ li@@ us, a centurion of au@@ gu@@ st@@ us ' band .
and entering into a ship of ad@@ ra@@ my@@ t@@ ti@@ u@@ m, we laun@@ che@@ d, me@@ an@@ ing to sail by the coasts of asia ; one ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us, a macedoni@@ an of thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , being with us .
and the next day we touched at sid@@ on . and ju@@ li@@ us cour@@ te@@ ously en@@ trea@@ ted paul, and gave him liber@@ ty to go unto his friends to re@@ fre@@ sh himself .
and when we had laun@@ ched from thence, we sailed under cyp@@ ru@@ s, because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilici@@ a and pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, we came to my@@ ra@@ , a city of ly@@ ci@@ a .
and there the centurion found a ship of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a sai@@ ling into i@@ tal@@ y ; and he put us therein .
and when we had sailed s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly many days, and s@@ car@@ ce were come over against c@@ ni@@ d@@ us, the wind not suf@@ f@@ ering us, we sailed under cre@@ te, over against sal@@ m@@ one ;
and, har@@ dly pas@@ sing it, came unto a place which is called the fa@@ ir ha@@ ven@@ s ; nigh whereunto was the city of la@@ sea .
now when much time was sp@@ ent, and when sai@@ ling was now d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous, because the fast was now already pa@@ st, paul ad@@ mon@@ ished them ,
and said unto them, sirs, i perceive that this vo@@ y@@ age will be with hu@@ r@@ t and much da@@ mag@@ e, not only of the la@@ ding and ship, but also of our li@@ ves .
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the ow@@ ner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by paul .
and because the ha@@ ven was not com@@ mo@@ di@@ ous to win@@ ter in, the more part ad@@ vi@@ sed to depart thence also, if by any means they might at@@ tain to phe@@ ni@@ ce, and there to win@@ ter ; which is an ha@@ ven of cre@@ te, and lie@@ th toward the south west and n@@ or@@ th west .
and when the south wind ble@@ w so@@ f@@ tly, sup@@ pos@@ ing that they had ob@@ ta@@ ined their purpo@@ se, loo@@ sing thence, they sailed clo@@ se by cre@@ te .
but not long after there arose against it a temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous wind, called e@@ u@@ ro@@ c@@ ly@@ d@@ on .
and when the ship was ca@@ u@@ ght, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her d@@ ri@@ ve .
and run@@ ning under a certain is@@ land which is called c@@ lau@@ da@@ , we had much work to come by the bo@@ at :
which when they had taken up, they used hel@@ p@@ s, under@@ gir@@ ding the ship ; and, fe@@ aring lest they should fall into the quick@@ s@@ and@@ s, stra@@ ke sai@@ l, and so were d@@ ri@@ ven .
and we being excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly to@@ ssed with a temp@@ est, the next day they light@@ ened the ship ;
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the ta@@ ck@@ ling of the ship .
and when neither sun nor star@@ s in many days appea@@ red, and no small temp@@ est lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, sirs, ye should have hear@@ k@@ ened unto me, and not have loosed from cre@@ te, and to have gained this har@@ m and lo@@ ss .
and now i exhor@@ t you to be of good che@@ er : for there shall be no lo@@ ss of any man 's life among you, but of the ship .
for there stood by me this night the angel of god, whose i am, and whom i serve ,
saying, fear not, paul ; thou must be brought before caesar : and, lo, god hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
where@@ fore, sirs, be of good che@@ er : for i believe god, that it shall be even as it was told me .
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain is@@ land .
but when the four@@ te@@ en@@ th night was come, as we were d@@ ri@@ ven up and down in ad@@ ri@@ a, about mid@@ night the shi@@ p@@ men dee@@ med that they drew near to some country ;
and s@@ oun@@ ded, and found it tw@@ en@@ ty fa@@ tho@@ ms : and when they had gone a little fur@@ ther, they s@@ ounded again, and found it fif@@ teen fa@@ tho@@ ms .
then fe@@ aring lest we should have fallen upon ro@@ ck@@ s, they cast four an@@ ch@@ ors out of the ster@@ n, and wi@@ shed for the day .
and as the shi@@ p@@ men were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the bo@@ at into the sea, under co@@ l@@ our as though they would have cast an@@ ch@@ ors out of the fore@@ ship ,
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved .
then the soldiers cut off the ro@@ pes of the bo@@ at, and let her fall off .
and while the day was coming on, paul besought them all to take meat, saying, this day is the four@@ te@@ en@@ th day that ye have tarried and continued fast@@ ing, having taken nothing .
wherefore i pray you to take some meat : for this is for your heal@@ th : for there shall not an ha@@ ir fall from the head of any of you .
and when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave than@@ ks to god in presence of them all : and when he had broken it, he began to eat .
then were they all of good che@@ er, and they also took some meat .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and six@@ teen souls .
and when they had eaten en@@ ough@@ , they light@@ ened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when it was day, they knew not the land : but they dis@@ co@@ vered a certain cre@@ e@@ k with a sho@@ re, into the which they were min@@ ded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ or@@ s, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the ru@@ d@@ der b@@ and@@ s, and ho@@ ised up the ma@@ in@@ sail to the wind, and made toward shor@@ e .
and fal@@ ling into a place where two se@@ as me@@ t, they ran the ship a@@ ground ; and the fore@@ part stu@@ ck fa@@ st, and remained un@@ mo@@ ve@@ ab@@ le, but the hin@@ der part was broken with the viol@@ ence of the wa@@ ves .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prison@@ ers, lest any of them should s@@ wi@@ m out, and es@@ cap@@ e .
but the centurion, willing to save paul, kept them from their purpo@@ se ; and commanded that they which could s@@ wi@@ m should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land :
and the re@@ st, some on bo@@ ar@@ ds, and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass, that they es@@ cap@@ ed all sa@@ f@@ e to land .
and when they were es@@ ca@@ pe@@ d, then they knew that the is@@ land was called me@@ li@@ t@@ a .
and the bar@@ bar@@ ous people shewed us no little kin@@ dness : for they kind@@ led a fire, and received us every one, because of the present ra@@ in, and because of the co@@ ld .
and when paul had gathered a b@@ und@@ le of sti@@ ck@@ s, and laid them on the fire, there came a vi@@ per out of the hea@@ t, and fast@@ ened on his hand .
and when the bar@@ bar@@ i@@ ans saw the ven@@ o@@ m@@ ous bea@@ st han@@ g on his hand, they said among themselves, no doub@@ t this man is a murde@@ re@@ r, who@@ m, though he hath es@@ cap@@ ed the sea, yet ven@@ ge@@ ance suffe@@ reth not to live .
and he sho@@ ok off the bea@@ st into the fire, and fe@@ lt no har@@ m .
howbeit they looked when he should have s@@ wo@@ ll@@ en, or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while, and saw no har@@ m come to him, they chan@@ ged their min@@ ds, and said that he was a god .
in the same qu@@ ar@@ ters were posses@@ sions of the chief man of the is@@ land, whose name was publi@@ us ; who received us, and lodged us three days cour@@ te@@ ously .
and it came to pass, that the father of publi@@ us lay sick of a fever and of a bloo@@ dy f@@ lu@@ x : to whom paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him .
so when this was done, others also, which had disea@@ ses in the is@@ land, came, and were healed :
who also honou@@ red us with many hon@@ ours ; and when we departed, they la@@ ded us with such things as were ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry .
and after three month@@ s we departed in a ship of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a, which had win@@ tered in the is@@ le, whose sign was cast@@ or and pol@@ lu@@ x .
and lan@@ ding at sy@@ ra@@ cu@@ se, we tarried there three days .
and from thence we fe@@ t@@ ched a com@@ pass, and came to r@@ he@@ gi@@ u@@ m : and after one day the south wind ble@@ w, and we came the next day to pu@@ te@@ o@@ l@@ i :
where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward ro@@ me .
and from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as ap@@ pi@@ i for@@ u@@ m, and the three ta@@ ver@@ ns : whom when paul sa@@ w, he than@@ ked god, and took c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge .
and when we came to ro@@ me, the centurion delivered the prison@@ ers to the captain of the gu@@ ard : but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldi@@ er that kept him .
and it came to pass, that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together : and when they were come together, he said unto them, men and brethren, though i have committed nothing against the people, or custo@@ ms of our fathers, yet was i delivered prison@@ er from jerusalem into the hands of the roman@@ s .
who, when they had exa@@ mined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me .
but when the jews spake against it, i was con@@ strained to appea@@ l unto caesar ; not that i had ought to accuse my nation of .
for this cause therefore have i called for you, to see you, and to speak with you : because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this cha@@ in .
and they said unto him, we neither received le@@ tters out of judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any har@@ m of thee .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thin@@ kest : for as concerning this se@@ c@@ t, we know that every where it is spoken against .
and when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lod@@ ging ; to whom he ex@@ p@@ ounded and testi@@ fied the kingdom of god, persua@@ ding them concerning jesus, both out of the law of moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till even@@ ing .
and some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not .
and when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that paul had spoken one word, well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
saying, go unto this people, and say, hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive :
for the heart of this people is waxed g@@ ro@@ ss, and their ears are du@@ ll of hear@@ ing, and their eyes have they clo@@ sed ; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and i should heal them .
be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles, and that they will hear it .
and when he had said these words, the jews departed, and had great reas@@ oning among themselves .
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him ,
preaching the kingdom of god, and teaching those things which concer@@ n the lord jesus christ, with all con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce, no man for@@ bid@@ ding him .
