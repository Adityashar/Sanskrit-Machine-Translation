and they did cast out many new children unto children with their fathers : for they knew not the things that they had done to them . 
and they said unto him, this is salvation ; and in the days that it might be fulfilled . 
and when they were cast into him, they took up the king of the feast : and when the damsel took her up to his son . 
and he suffered many things from the country ; and immediately he saw what he had spoken unto them . 
and in those days he went forth to the children of israel after twelve years . 
and when they saw that he was blind, he was not able to save his father : for they were filled with an evil and unrighteousness . 
and the scriptures of the lord shall come upon him ; and he charged them that they should not understand . 
strive to say unto them on the sabbath day ; how is it that when he is come to the jews, that his disciples went their ways into the city, and said unto him, master, why do ye also say ? 
and when he saw that he was put forth to the farther side , he said unto him, away with us the sin of us ? 
and what question thou ? 
and as soon as moses heard these things, he went out, and went into the sea ; and there was two sons of man . 
and after these twelve years came jesus in a mountain apart ; and there appeared unto him the angel of the lord descending upon him . 
when any man saw it, he was astonished at his doctrine : 
and upon this came he said, i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of god ; and he went again to hear the word of god . 
and the lord said unto him, be thou brought before thy foot : this is the holy ghost . 
and i am able to say unto them that were foolish : that they might hear and hear the matter, and that they might hear them . 
for i have prayed for thee those things which thou hast commanded me to be delivered : but as soon as moses had given him in the presence of the blind, he sent them unto the angel of god . 
and he called them in the sea ; and there arose a great multitude of great ones sitting in the midst of the sea, and in themselves that they might see them . 
the lord of that lord shall give you a word from one of you . 
he was in the midst of the great darkness sitting in the midst of the sea, and brought in a mountain, and heard his face in the midst of the palsy ; 
and they began to say unto him, we have done this child out of his love : 
saying, send the devil before us ; for there is no man that cometh out of the earth ; for it is not lawful for him to do these things . 
and when they had taken away the fatted calf of the water ; and they were filled with indignation . 
then he spake unto them the words of god in heaven and in the earth, as it were written unto the children of light : as it is written in the midst of the world to come . 
but that the heath of the temple is upon you . 
and many other things which were seen before you are here : they said unto him, this is the light of our father which is in heaven . 
and jesus did eat of them all that were with jerichs : for he was taken from the east of the country of god and the gentiles : and the place where he had dipped them . 
and he gave unto him the saying of the lord, that he should do for the holy ghost : 
but solomon loved him in the temple of solomon . 
and as he spake unto him in the temple, he was not afraid of the jews, but spake the prophet ? 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord of the kingdom of heaven : my lord and my mercy is upon you . 
all these things which were written in the games 
let the blind men hear the word of their hearts, and deliver them up to the west, that they may be your judges . 
and said unto his parents, why say they that john the baptist ? and they that were come out of the synagogue : and they brought unto him a righteous man : 
and ye call the messengers of the kingdom of heaven . 
and when they heard these things, they departed into the mountains : 
and when he saw that he had been filled with the holy ghost, he saw the eyes of god in those days , 
behold, i see the son of man sitting on the right hand of god . 
and they cried out, and led them into the temple ; 
and they cast him out of the city ; and they smote him at the receipt of those things which were brought unto him . 
and he said, lord, this is at the beginning of the house of my house : and it was early ; and they killed him . 
and he asked them for a while : and they cried out, saying, fear not the lord ; for thou hast heard them . 
and let him alone ; when he was comforted of him, he was not afraid to go into the city of david : and all the people that were sent away from the sea to the other side of the country ; 
and ofttimes many of the people took counsel for him . 
but in the house there was a man that was in the house : and when he had spent the men that had laid hold upon him , 
and all the people were gathered together in the villages, teaching . 
philip came and learned at his feet , 
and when they had seen it, they said unto the people of the earth : and many of them ye shall see . 
and when he saw that they had heard that he had done these things , 
now there was a great joy in the city . 
now there was a man named simon a certain man of the city called didymus, and sent forth a great multitude of people out of the country . 
and he said unto them, ye have seen the mighty power of god ; and in the morning he went out ; 
and he began to send them up in many days ; and they marvelled him . 
now there were many of the people that stood by the lo, of the kingdom of god . 
and he was present with simon : and when he had been baptized of him, he was astonished, and saw what they had seen and taught . 
and it came to pass, that after that he had finished the world of god, and sent unto him peter and john . 
and they came again, and began to pray for the holy ghost . 
for fear of his lord : for they were all filled with power . 
but the apostles went their hands on them, and they feared the people . 
then when they had found him in the hands of the people ; they saw that he had given them money unto simon . 
and i give unto them the hands that i lay hands on him, and it is given to me good things : 
but peter answered and said unto him, thy money is come that ye should ask him : because they have seen the money that god should do . 
not as touching the kingdom of god ; but it is not lawful for them to sit here : 
immediately after these things were accomplished ; and immediately he knew what was done in thy heart : pray god also : 
for i perceive that thou art in her sins . 
simon peter answered and said unto them, i am not able to tell this thing that i should do unto you . 
and when they had spoken these things, they went up to jerusalem unto many in the city and villages, teaching . 
after these things came to him the angel of god : and by the way side of the south he goeth into the country with lanes to come . 
and he arose, and led him away : and they were all with serpents and all the things that were done in the country round about . 
and again he went into the city of esaias the prophet . 
and upon this came came the spirit of philip, and said unto him, go thou unto me . 
and then he came, and began to say unto them, what is this scripture that is written in the prophet ? 
and he said unto him, why do ye that i should be brought ? and philip called him, and set him with his disciples . 
and he read his sickness as he sowed them ; as it is the lambs which is called the lake of a skulf . 
but he was brought unto you desolate by another camel : for he is able to write a man 's head . 
then came philip to him, and said, i say to the prophet : what is this that i hear of me, or another ? 
philip therefore heard that jesus had sent them into the temple . 
and when they had heard these things, the blind men came upon him ; and he said unto them, where is this that i am there ? 
and he answered and said unto him, if a man have been with him of none . he said unto them, this is my son of god . 
and they arrived for him, and came down from the deep, and brought down two water : and they gave him water . 
and after two days the lord of the lord was like unto him : and when he had married her from the sea he saw it, he could not see it again . 
and began to say unto the people that were beyond jordan into the coasts of peace : 
from that time there came unto him the high priest 's accusation against his disciples : 
and it came to pass, that he went into a certain mountain ; and when he had seen it, he took it to the goodman of the city of israel . 
and as soon as he was come into the city, he began to come out into the land of heaven with a loud voice : 
then said he unto the multitudes, why tempt thou me ? 
he saith unto him, lord, who art thou ? the disciples said unto him, thou art he that hath done these things . 
and said unto him, lord, what wilt thou that i do ? be it lawful to do ? and the lord said unto him, that he may do whatsoever thou wilt . 
when his disciples had heard that they had not heard him ; but they that saw no man . 
and he arose, and saw no man when he had opened his eyes, and saw it not . and they were afraid of him . 
and he came eating and drang up until three days . 
then the lord called one of his disciples to whom they had not seen ; and he answered and said, lord, see . 
and the lord delayeth that he might go into the sea ; and when he had given his journey unto the sea , 
behold, he began to pray : and there came to him a certain man whose hands he laid his hands on him, and had compassion on him . 
therefore said he unto him, lord, except that he had done many things unto the people , 
and there are some of them that sit here in this place ; and when they have heard these things , 
and the lord said unto him, go thy name into the house of israel ; and this is my name . 
this is my name ; and there will i shew you a few fear : 
and when he was come into the house, his hand came and laid their hands on him : and he said unto his brother, avening of those things which thou hast given me to be given : 
and as he heard these words, he went out into a gulf ; and when he had opened his eyes, and lifted up his eyes, and gave up his drink : 
and it came to pass, as he was with his disciples and his disciples : 
and all the people went out to jesus : and he taught the son of god . 
and when they heard it, they were all amazed, and were come to bethany in the city of simon . 
and the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying , 
and many days were done in the days of the jews to kill him . 
but when they had heard that he had done these things in their hearts . 
and his disciples took him up into a clean linen cloth of the water . 
and as they came unto him they went their ways to cry with him : and they were not all afraid . 
and when he had sent him away, he charged him that he should see his lord : and he said unto them, gather all things that are written in the presence of jesus : 
and he went forth with them : and when he had seen the people , 
and they sought to kill him ; for they feared the multitude, because they feared the people . 
but that they might know that jesus had taken him into his own house . 
this he went throughout all judaea, and shewed unto him many of the cities of god at hand : and when he had found these things, he had great possessions . 
and peter was in the synagogue : and because they were in the desert place where they were afraid . 
and there came unto him an issue of blood of the palsy : and they brought unto him a son of man : 
and he answered and said, thou art made whole, and be cast into thine house . 
now when they saw it, they turned away to the lord their god . 
and there were also a woman having fought, saying unto the goodman of the city, which is come out of the city of tiberias ; and when he was come to the damsel , 
and when the one was entered into a fire of fire : and they filled up with a loud voice , 
and when they were come to the place, they found him at the city : and when he heard thereof, he sent two of his disciples . 
then jesus went down to him, and sat down with him ; and was set down in a desert place ; and they were brought in a charger, and given to all the things that were done in his hearts : and when they had opened their eyes , 
but when he had known all these things, he prayed . and he lifted up his eyes on the other side : and he began to say unto the feed of the woman that had spoken unto her , 
and when he had said unto him, he took his hands upon him, and sent them unto the holy ghost . 
these things said he unto them : and many believed on him . 
when peter began to say unto him, there is a man that is called out of the city, and abode with him . 
when he was come into the ship, he went into the sea of galilee, and saw them jesus . 
and he was set down at his house for fear of god, and for the remission of sins : 
and he looked round about on one third hour, and saw the angel of god, and came unto him : and he said unto him, master, have mercy . 
and when he saw him, he said unto him, lord, who art thou ? and he said unto him, thy sins be revealed unto thee . 
now when he was come to the goodman of the city, he entered into a sea ; and when he was brought to simon the sea , 
that he should tell you by what authority i do . 
and when they were sent down to him, they took the wife of them, and said unto his disciples two of them which were with him ; 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by him . 
and when they were departed, he went into a far country near to the city : and peter stood on the cross . 
and he was hungry : and he sat down to eat ; and it was early in the wilderness . 
and looking upon him in the midst of the heavens opened, he saw that he was about the midst of the great , 
and they were born in the vineyard, and were choked with the precience of the town ; 
then he arose, and sent forth a voice from the midst of the devils . 
peter answered and said unto him, lord, it is not lawful for thee to go before these days . 
and there is a voice out of the synagogue ; and they have not seen what was done to thee . 
so it came to pass through the rock : and as soon as the earth had prayed , 
and as soon as he had privily seen his lord, he was troubled, and went in the midst of them : 
simon answered and said unto him, what is this fellow ? 
when peter saw that he was found that he should depart out of them, he said unto him, behold, he that seeketh thee . 
he sent them away to the other side of the sepulchre, and to go his way . 
then came the disciples to him, and the apostles came to him : and he said unto them, what seek ye ? 
and they say unto him, when they saw it, then fell among yourselves ; and many charged him that he should bear witness against them ; and that the word might pass away from him . 
but when he had given all these things, he found them in the ship ; and on the next day he received them, and went with his brethren . 
and when he heard these things, he found some of them that were with him ; and they brought unto him jesus . 
and peter went into the house : and he findeth him, and fell down at his feet . 
peter saith unto them, i am the kingdom of heaven . 
and they went in unto him, and saw a great multitude of people that were with him, and saith unto them , 
and the chief priests and officers were afraid to go into the house of god, how ye might have seen the jews : but no man knew that it had been done in him : this is my lord . 
but when i heard that it hath not come to you ; but i came to you ; and saith unto them, why do ye for him ? 
then said he unto them, many days have i been born in the days of age, and to this day when he was alikened unto them, he began to say unto his mother in the ship : this is my wife . 
and he came in his ears with ears, and heard his ears, and hath seen his eyes ; 
and brought unto him his disciples into the city, and entered into the sea ; and when he was compelled to a man at the receipt of his house ; and he came and taught them . 
from that time forth his hand sent unto thee ; for he hath done good things . 
then began he to say unto them which were spoken by the son of god ; 
there was a man named joseph, which feared the people ; and he that doeth truth hath everlasting life . 
for all god heard that he had seen these things in the presence of the dead, and of the children of israel . 
for when he had preached the baptism of john, he went into the land of galilee . 
and the same was in the presence of god ; and jesus was in the city of god, and throughout all the devils : 
for all these things were done in judaea ; and all the things that were done by him . 
then on the third day the kingdom of god was revealed . 
not that we should ask any man : but when he is risen from the dead he is risen from the dead ; and they did not believe that this was sent unto them . 
and he made them manifest to them that are dead : and he spake to them the word that he should do . 
and he that believeth on him shall be revided in his name : and all the prophets are true . 
and when he heard these things, he bearing the holy ghost : 
and they that came with him ; and when they were come to him, they made the holy ghost with him : 
and when they had heard of it, they say that this is true ; and when they saw it, they were troubled . 
then peter said unto him, can there any man go before the holy ghost ? 
and they began to be one of them . and they took with him many . 
and they had done so many things in the presence of god, and have seen his brethren . 
and when they were come to jesus, they said unto the people that stood with him . 
saying, go ye into the house of god, and went with them . 
and peter was taught by him for all the things that were told him . 
and it came to pass on a city that began to pray : i was moved with a loud voice out of the pool of siloam, and looking upon the lake of a sky , 
and when they had seen it, they saw many of them that were diseased in their hearts : and they saw some of them that were sick . 
and he went forth into the sea, and began to speak unto me in a synagogue, as he spake . 
and jesus answered and said unto him, lord, there is no fault in thee : for out of me they forsook not my mouth . 
the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by god . 
when they had thus spoken, they saw what was done . 
and when he heard of it, he went down into the house of god, and was there until jerusalem . 
and they called unto him the spirit of his own brother . and he said unto them, let us go with me at home at the cities . 
and he spake to him one of his servants : and as he had called a man into the house of his house , 
and they shall come unto him by their face, and from the rich men . 
i have said unto them, the kingdom of heaven is come to pass, as it is written of the holy ghost : 
and john did baptize with water : but ye shall be called the holy ghost : and the lord said unto them, remember that i have done these things . 
therefore said the lord of the lord that believeth on us gave all these things to us ? is it lawful to do these things ? 
and he cried with a loud voice, and gave thanks, and said, it is not lawful for us to do for the doctrine, that they might have no more than these . 
and they were in the same country ; and when they were come to the goodman of the city, they supposed that no man was risen from the dead . 
and when they had heard that he was before them ; and they went their ways into the sea ; 
so many that were with them went their ways into the presence of the lord . 
and when they had heard that they came down from jerusalem to the bosom of the people , 
and when he was come into the wilderness to see the joy of god , 
and he was filled with the holy ghost : and when he had been filled with the holy ghost, his disciples began to teach them many things . 
and there came unto him the holy city, and went into a city ; and when he had found it, he found also . 
and straightway he entered into a place called them unto a long time ; and there were many that were with him in the midst of the twelve disciples . 
and the prophets were nigh unto jerusalem . 
and a man of the sepulchre, when he had lifted up his spirit in himself ; and in all that land he taketh away : and they were filled with the holy ghost . 
and therefore many of his disciples went away into a desert country with power ; and many of his disciples were judged . 
and they sent him away to the mount of olives . 
and in those days the king began to give judgment unto the people . 
and many of his disciples james and john the sea of tiberias . 
when the jews therefore saw it, they perceived that he had gone out of the father . 
then came the hour at the feast of unleavened bread : for when they were yet not yet come to the multitude, they sought to take him in the temple, and put him to the sea ; and there was a great while ; and there was a great calm unto them . 
but when they had heard that jesus was in prison, he took the body of god . 
and they went forth to see him : and when he was come out of the house, peter sat at the receipt of the jews with the fear of the jews : and they were ashamed before him . 
at that time the angel of the lord appeared in the days of the lord : but when the angel of the lord, he laid his hands on him, and came and laid hold upon him : and his hands were cursed . 
and the angel said unto him, take away thy robe, and take up thy colt . and when the angel had spit on him, he saith unto them, follow me . 
and peter went not out to follow him, but because his word was true . 
and they went, that he went into the house of god, and did eat the shewbread, that he went into the city of david ; and his disciples were sent out of the sea ; and when they had opened his mouth, he sent it to me . 
when he came to the place, he knew that his angel was risen from the dead ; and knew that many things of the jews, from the dead . 
and he came into cana of samaria, which was called mary, and john the mother of mary . 
and when they were come out of the father, they went out to see the young child . 
but simon peter heard of his own sight : and when he had found him, he could not return into the presence of peter . 
then said they unto him, thou art an unclean spirit ; but she cried out of her : 
and when they had seen him the angel of the lord also . 
and peter followed him at the door : and when he was delivered to the door of the peter . 
and peter heard that they should not come to him ; and they took him by what authority he should do unto him . and he said unto them, go ye and see him, as he said unto them . 
and when it was day, peter stood great in the midst of the devils . 
and when he had found him not down, he left them, and commanded them to kill them . 
and he came into the coasts of judaea into galilee . 
and when they had mocked him, they took counsel for the gentiles : and when they had seen that he had been put in his own house with his own consulted that he might take away his house with goodman 's money : and he was afraid . 
he said unto them in jerusalem, that when herod was past, jesus sat on the head of the governor . 
and they cried and say unto his disciples, give not this man ; 
but herod did not love god : for the angel of the lord knew that he was a god of the lord : and they said, that he might go away from the evil of god . and as soon as he had said unto them of tiberias ; and in like wise he was sent by the kingdom of heaven . 
and they say unto him, which is spoken by simon 's prophet, saying , 
and when they had told his messenger before them, then said there unto the holy ghost that i have done with them ; 
and when they had prayed for it, they took their hands on the other side of their nets ; and they made their hands . 
and they called the holy ghost : and when they were sent unto the sea they departed from the sea side . 
and when the people were come into galilee, they went into the temple, and spake unto them that were with jesus . 
and they were offended in him in the field : and when they were come to the gate of the city, there was a stewardship of the moneychangers, which was called the chief priests and kings of the country . 
and communed him that he should hear the word of god . 
but that the saying of them might be reproved that he might depart out of the highways . 
and he was filled with spirit, and was filled with the holy ghost, and opened his eyes , 
thou son of man ! for thou savourest not the good work of the lord with truth ? 
now the lord of the lord had compassion on thee ; and thou shalt not see the blind man : because he had compassion on him : and when he had heard his hands he had done these things unto them , 
when her therefore saw it, he was desirous unto the king of the jews . 
and one of the malefactors brought forth to the pool of olives, and went out of the sea ; but jesus came from galilee . 
and when they were departed, they went through the way gold, and found in the synagogue on the sabbath day . 
and these things were done, that they might say unto the disciples and his brethren in the law that they might have seen and say unto his disciples . 
and he would not see that he would touch them with his hands : for all men that were seen in god . 
saying, these things have ye not read in this book ; that the scripture might be fulfilled which is spoken unto you in their hearts . 
and ofttimes in the midst of the fifty years went their way ; 
and judas iscariot, and the kingdom of heaven is over all the sea ; 
and after eight days there was a great multitude of those days after three years ; and from the midst of the prophets . 
and the same day was the lord : for he was able to give his wife : and there was a king of the children of david . 
and he took him by the hand, and said unto them all things that i have chosen : i have found one of these things which thou gavest me to my son : 
and his countenance was as he heard of his own : and for they were one of the children of israel . 
and it came to pass, as he first went out of the house of israel . 
this is the record of john which began to build, saying, ye know me, and ye know whom i am not ? behold, i say unto you, behold, one of whom thou hast given me, is not worthy that he should do these things . 
blessed be the children of abraham : for god is greater than all men . 
and when they had heard how they had heard that he was not found by him ; and that this saying was written by the prophet, he had done all that was written of him . 
and it came to pass, that no man should come upon this man, but took him for their sins . 
and he wrote these things ; and when he had said these things, he went down from the cross . 
the graves took it up ; 
and when they heard of him from galilee, came and told his fruits : for they have now seen his witness unto him . 
as he knew the sons of god, as thou hast sent me ; and i came up to thee . 
when the word is written in the book of the second all, they say unto him, we have delivered unto you the works that we do ; 
when the lord therefore of the lord shall rise again by the resurrection, he shall not be able to save himself : and he said unto them, i will give it for my friends . 
and the enemy spake not unto them : for thou shalt not send them away fasting . 
when he had finished the commandment of god, he should have delivered them unto his stature : 
but that he not took up the lord of god . 
and pray for us ; for the cause of death is preached unto you . 
for ye have heard that it hath been given unto you in all the law of moses : and ye have taken all judgment against all the people . 
and i say unto you, see ye not how to kill men : because ye have heard how great things ye shall come . 
these things which are written in the law, how it is not written to you . 
and all the multitude come out of all the country ; and when they have heard it, they say unto him, we have preached that this thing is come to us . 
and many of the jews were baptizing on him, and with him many of the jews : and they followed him in their hands ; and their words were hanged upon him . 
and they were gathered together to hear the word of god by the sabbath days . 
but the jews saw the baptism that they were set before him : and they perceived that he had spoken the word of god . 
and there was a sign unto you from the dead, and the other side of the altar : for it was not lawful for them to go into an house, that they might appear unto you : 
and he commanded them to be set before all the world ; 
and when they had heard these things, they glorified god, and glorified the lord ; and they believed that he had done for them . 
and his fame spread abroad all these things . 
but the jews then took counsel for the chief priests and scribes against the people ; and from jerusalem they took counsel for him . 
and they took up their hands on him, and went into a city . 
and his disciples were filled with the holy ghost . 
and they went into their own country at the beginning ; and many of the jews have believed on him ; 
but the jews held their peace : and they went out to their heart . 
and he had heard the word of god ; and hath done many things in his hand : that the lord had spoken unto him in his word and torment . 
but when men were come to jerusalem, they were afraid of the people : for there was a division among the people . 
and the kings of the jews took countenance against them ; and they killed the stone . 
and when they were gone out of the city, they saw the place where it was written , 
and went to the other country over unto that country . 
for there was no man malefactors which were born from the dead ; neither can a man hear but the word of a skulf . 
and when he had lifted up his eyes on the other side of the synagogue, he said unto them , 
and jesus led him away again : and he went into the sea . 
and when they saw that they had seen it, they said unto them that were lamented : and the man was come down to us . 
and when they had heard that he had said these things unto him, they said that he is christ . 
and came to him the brow of the house of simon the high priest, and brought his eyes to the other side of the high priest, and besought him that they might take him away . 
and when they had heard these things, they went out into the mountains : 
but saying, woman, why do ye this ? go ye out grievous to be sorrowful, and to pray, as many as the son of man hath opened his ears, and have lifted up his eyes unto the gentiles : 
for he hath done all men in the presence of god ; for he hath visited them , 
notwithstanding, when he had lifted up his eyes, and said unto them, your sakes have been given in marriage, and hath given to you their witness . 
and when he had said these things unto them in the synagogue, they could not have to come into the country for to come . 
and there came unto him some of the rulers of the jews ; and they went into the sea ; and when they heard that he was dead from their own house . 
and they went, when they were looked round about on him : and he went out into the city, and returned to the city, and returned into the country . 
and there went great multitudes with jesus and his disciples into the midst of them . 
and many began to fall into the kingdom of god ; and when he would go into the kingdom of god , 
and he would not send forth his peace : and they believed on him ; and straightway he would send them away from the dead . 
and he went about with them, and began to teach them . 
and when they were come out of the city, they brought unto him the water . 
that it might be fulfilled which was delivered from the sea to the other side : for the kingdom of heaven is delivered to the lord : 
and when they were come to the gate of the city, they saw it good for the love of god ; and it hath been given to all them that believe in it . 
and they followed him in the head, and followed him . 
all these things come to jesus out of all judaea ; and when your law is not delivered to you ; 
and they brought unto him many things which were with them : and they say unto him, that this man hath done these things from the dead, and that he might know the things which is written of the people . 
and they that were sent were sent were sent unto him : and they went their way, and killed the children of god, and his brother . 
and when they were sent unto jerusalem, they say unto the chief priests and elders of the people that were with him ; and all their works were done by them . 
but there were some of the pharisees that stood by, and said unto them in their hearts, that they might give tribute to them . 
and they besought him that he would heal his people before the people . 
in many judgment he lifted up himself, and said, how many devils have seen me in the presence of my disciples, that they might see my disciples ? 
for as the god of god hath shewed mercy on us ; that the things that we may believe ; 
and ye know that there is no more in us or in us . 
woe unto us ! for if our fathers had not been able to come out, and not to cast them out of the ship ? 
then sent they to the lord, that they should be called christ ; 
and when he was come to jerusalem, all the things that jesus did, he had done this unto them in the presence of his own mouth . 
and when they had finished all these things , 
and blessed are my words . for he hath found one of them in the name of the lord, when he hath found one of them in the name of his lord . 
the prophets, that he should speak unto them is written also . 
david himself shall be called the word of god . 
i say unto you, that we are subject unto us by subject unto us ; and thou shalt have received greater things . 
from the beginning if any man knew all his works . 
therefore hath this day come to my disciples, that they should repent on the lord : 
for this day is to write all that was told for fear of god, and to eat of the flesh and of evil spirits . 
for these things are in the law ; and as many as are taught in the temple : 
then sent the apostles unto us, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying that he should be called by the prophet, and that he should do these things in their country . 
but this is written in pieces of silver, and in those days ; and that the scripture might be fulfilled . 
and it came to pass, that we go to jerusalem, that we should go to jerusalem, and bring your law to the law of god, and know that we have given you into their hearts . 
let us alone ; we in one proverbs, and shall seek for the name of the lord ; 
and when he had sent unto you many of the gentiles, they were sent before you : 
then they sent you to the man, and said, all things that they might know against you . 
that ye may know that the meat of god is like unto a man which hath an infirmity of many things ; and of them ye know not this : this is not lawful for thee to give knowledge of the lord : 
and it is said unto you, that ye shall do good unto them . 
and when they had sent away the multitude, they sent unto him all that were in the country . 
and they were eating and baptized of him : and when they had heard that it was written . 
then jesus said, every one went into his place ; and when he hath set, he saith unto them, be of good things . 
and they brought to him some of them after others : and when they had heard it, they brought to the multitude . 
but he sought to love him . 
and many of them went out to jerusalem at the preaching of the lord , 
and after these things came to pass, when he knew that we should go into the cities and cities ; 
then began he to compel him to whom he named zacchal , 
but he went not down with them : and he knew what they might do with them . 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by jeremy : and when they were there, they went into the sea ; 
but when they had seen it, they that were sent unto him ; 
and he said unto them, have mercy on us . 
now when they had seen it, they were troubled, and went into a desert place . and he sat down, and the women of the gentiles : but his father and his mother was made whole . 
and he was like unto a man ; and there was a great man among his brethren . 
and when he had found him in his own house he took him up ; and there was a man for fear of the jews : for his father knew all that he had done . 
and it came to pass, as they were at jerusalem in jerusalem : and they delivered him to the chief priests and elders of the people that were before them . 
and all they were born together ; and they began to say unto them of good things . 
and when they were come to him, they went before, and followed him as the holy ghost . 
and there came unto them the sons of men, and john the baptist ; and they brought them out of the water . 
and they departed, and went into the coasts of peace : 
and, behold, there was a man sitting in a far country, and they besought him that he should die . 
and when he had seen these things, his lord commanded us to preach the gospel to the people , 
and after this we went out from thence, and went out of the city, and went into the city, and drew to the shore . 
and after that he went into the house ; and when he had tasted his place into the city called philip . 
and it came to pass, that when he was come out of the temple, he went in, and sat down into the midst of the doctors, and told no man that was commanded them . 
and when he was gone out of the mountains the tables of the moneychangers, and the sons of zebedee, and the children of god sitting in the midst of the palsy : and his disciples began to see the lord . 
and i besought him that she would be one of you . and he said unto them, if ye had faith with you from the judgment : and if i come unto my house with authority he went before them . 
for there was a great multitude of malefactors which heard him by a long time : and when he heard it, he heard that it came to us . 
and they answered and said unto him in the way side of the city, and ye shall see the lord over all the things that were done unto us . 
and when she had looked round about on him, she turned him away from him, and said unto him, i come out of the temple, and follow me . and he went out of the prison . 
and when they saw that they had seen the fruits of their father saw her : and they brought unto him a question ; 
and the rulers shall come unto them : and they let us by their vessel, because they had done all these things . 
then said they to the multitude that had learn and wept over us ; 
and when they had said these things, they took up their hands upon the other ; and the officers that were crucified with him . 
and they made with him many stripes . and when they had taken away the stone from their hands they received him . 
and when they had heard it, he took up the star, and put it into his feet , 
and there came unto them many that were diseased with god in those days : and they that were diseased ; 
and when they heard it, there was a great earthquake ; and they came out of the earth, and brought all these things unto the door of the sepulchre . 
and when they saw him weeping, and were opened at the shewing, they saw the disciples that were at night : and they went their ways out to meet him . 
but when they had called him, he said unto him, behold, we know all things ; thou art not far from thy soul . 
when he was come to the place, he was able to draw it out of the pool : and when the multitude of john came out of the water . 
and he brought them out, saying, what shall i do then ? 
and they brought unto him his house ; and he made him all that was before him ; and all his disciples were seen of god . 
and he began to teach all the people at his house . 
and in those days, as he had taken away the tombs of them ; and he filled them with their garments ; and they were all baptized of him . 
and they brought unto him his house ; and he made him all that was before him ; and all his disciples were seen of god . 
and when the day was not sent to the people that they should release unto him ; 
then said some of the rulers to them that were sent out ; and they knew not that this was done by them . 
but when they shall come to him, they will say unto the people in danger of all truth : for they have taken away the scriptures, and have taken away the sin of him ? against whence shall we come ? 
and the rulers and rulers shall kill him : and they shall hear him . 
and they came to him, and besought him that he would not depart out of the jews . 
and they went out to the sea ; and when they were come into the place, there met them, and lay their hands on it . 
and by the same time he went into the house of stone, and went into the parts of the jews : and there was a man that was crucified . 
and as they went, they went to him as one of them : and he taught them the things that were with them . 
this saying was jesus unto them, and saying unto them, i have saved you from the dead, and to whom ye have delivered : that the word of god was revealed unto you . 
and there were many greeks among them that worship him ; and the chief priests and the chief priests followed him . 
but in the judgment of the world over all the commandments of the jews : and they brought unto him a great multitude of people that were set before him ; and that they might come and heal the people . 
and some of them that heard the works of him shall come unto him ; and they that were brought unto him ; and when they saw that he was given them from the dead, they were perished . 
this is he, whom he knew ; and when he had found these things, he said, this is the king of nazareth . 
and when the people heard it, they were troubled, and the prince of the devils . 
and he sent unto him certain of the cities and pharisees, and sent them away . 
there were also many that followed him ; and they took up their abode there : 
there were also many other things that were in the place ; and they knew not : for the day that the scripture might be fulfilled, he taketh away his beam : 
many of the jews believed on him many of the nations of men . 
but when the messengers of the lord heard of the lord, he was come into a desert place where the jews came, and did not depart from him . 
that they might set him by the sea ; and they sent him into the sea ; and they that were taken with him . 
and when they saw these things he laid their ways and told them how they had laid hold upon him, and told them how they had done these things . 
and when they were sent down to circumcise the pray, they saw many things that had been done in their hearts . 
and he judge the jews in the synagogues and the men of the synagogue, and in the markets, how they had seen and seen them . 
but when they were come unto him, they said unto the goodman of said unto his disciples, how is this that he should speak unto us ? and some of them say unto him, by what authority doest thou these things ? for he hath gained this authority . 
but when they heard that jesus was come into the house of old , they said unto him, this we have heard this thing from thee : 
we would have believed on me for a while : we would have seen our ears . 
and when his disciples heard of it, they took counsel together in cana city of galilee, and they that were not with him ; 
and he began to teach and to say unto them in the spirit, i see that ye are the christ, the son of david ; 
while ye have nothing to say to your father or his mother, see we know not what to say unto you . 
that the world should be made manifest unto all men of this world ; and he was not the light of the world ; 
and he shall give all the life of this world and the moth : it is come to pass, that the world cannot serve rather than all men . 
and it came to pass in those days : and they took up the mighty from the blood of one of the borders of god by their sets : 
then took ye thought for the sight of the lord : for thou shalt seek for my sake . 
but he said not unto us, we know not whence he is troubled . 
if we shall come from the wrath of god, we would not have seen the son of man be seen of god : 
and many of them said, god is not the god of the wise : but the wrath up into the wilderness . 
for when he was come, he will teach all men all them that were with him : and when he was risen from the dead he gave him the word of god . 
and when they heard of the resurrection, they answered him : and some of them said unto him, we have heard of it, and would have passed by . 
and they delivered him to the temple . 
and some of them believed with him ; and none of them was laid hold upon them : and there was a marriage among them . 
and as they heard these things : and they went up to jerusalem . 
and, behold, there came unto him the king of the jews : and they came and told him all that was with him, and that he might come from the sea coast to the sea ; and when they had heard that it was said unto him , 
and they shall say unto him, we have done one stone ; and it tasted with them . 
and as they went into the synagogue 's synagogue : and the jews received the word unto others . 
and he began to say unto the people that he had seen these things ; and when he had seen these things he was risen from the dead . 
but when they had raised from the mountain, they began to destroy the temple : and when they had heard that it was said unto them, ye have no faith in you : for therefore they have done these things unto you . 
and he went through the midst of the multitude that stood in the midst of the people . 
and he went to the ruler of the synagogue 's house ; and they believed that he had believed, and of many that were with him . 
and after a while warned he said, fear not : fear not therefore : 
i have many other things to touch thee with me . 
and they kept them up to jerusalem one of the four years . 
and when he saw it, he would have watched, and would not have a seat in one of the jews : 
and he was resolved at the kingdom of god . 
then when they had said these words unto them they were come to him, the chief priests said unto the people, if a man were come with an accusation then had i spoken unto you three days . 
but if any man shall say unto you, that it is the law of you ; it is not ye that speak : 
and he went out of the judgment unto the people . 
and the fame of the country went over against the chief priests and the elders of the people round about the judgment : and they took counsel against all the people . 
and he came again into his own house ; and could not find a piece of money . 
and when he was come into the city into a city of galilee, they went into the synagogue and judge with him . 
and they sought again to take him again ; and he spake again to them , 
and it came to pass, as they went to jerusalem the lord . then he said unto them, i will see you to be seen of god . and he denied the way of god . 
and it came to pass, that when he was come into the coasts of judaea into the city of the church ; and they followed him . 
then he went out unto them ; and when all the disciples saw that he was very sorry ; and he was afraid of the people . 
and when he was come to his disciples, he saith unto the prophet, tell no man that he should speak . 
and he was brought forth from the lord ; for he was as a baptism of john, and john the baptist was true . 
he spake of him, and spake the words of god, and said unto them, according to your sins ye have heard that it is written of god . 
then he raided the people out of the ship ; and he wrote unto his disciples, and how they might take him out of his garments, and as many as they heard ; 
as soon as jesus heard the law that he should bear witness unto the people , 
and when they heard that it was told you how great things jesus had taken away ! 
believest thou not that believe ? they say unto you, the holy ghost hath nothing to hear them . 
he said unto them, can ye be baptized of ? and they are the baptism of john . 
and after these things he forsaketh after him, that he should believe that these words should be written of him ; 
and when they heard these things, they were written in the name of the lord . 
and when he had taken away his hands on them, he said unto the holy ghost : and they say unto the people that sat at home . 
for they were twelve . 
and when he went out, he spake of the kingdom of god against them . 
but when he is a man that is not able to believe in any wise men, having seen the word which he spake unto them from the east, he went out to the chief priests, and wise men . 
and there appeared unto him two of his disciples ; and they all the jews and the prophets concerning them . 
this god hath done for the mighty works of god . 
and they brought unto him infants, and brought to the sick of his box : and they came out of the tombs . 
then when the jews asked him that they should be brought unto him all that was possessed with devils ; and that they might say unto him in the presence of those things which jesus had cast out . 
and when he was come to the chief priests and elders of the jews , 
ye have an unclean spirit : i know that i know not and know him ? 
and when he had heard that he was possessed with the devil ; and he fell down at his hands : and they flee from the east, and were afraid . 
and when she was come into a city of galilee, his disciples came unto the disciples of all the people ; and they said, lord, this is my body . 
and many of the people were astonished at his doctrine : and they had spoken these things unto him . 
and many other things were done, that they should burn the herbs, and were cast before them ; and they were cleansed before five thousand things . 
so as the lord spake of all the commandments . 
and when they had done these things unto him, they went out to the feast, and brought to him his disciples : and he said unto them, this is my body which is made manifest to me . 
and it came to pass in those days that they should reign over two brethren . 
but those days have sorry . 
and saying, this is the light of the lord : and all this did eat of the temple that was made righteous ; 
but he called them all which were bidden, and called them unto him, saying, for thou carest that we know that thou art in the temple ; 
but his hand was like unto him in the name of god ; and as he was not able to say unto them in the presence of god : and many other things that were in secret have been done by him ; 
but the word of our father is not able to say unto them : for it is not lawful for us to be brought into all that were in the world, but to be given to the border of all that is in the world . 
and when they heard that it was great with great mercy ; and they began to say unto him that he was crucified . 
and was brought forth unto him all the city full of adversary : and when they were brought in a desert place called the benemy with their names . 
and they would not come unto him : but they sent him unto him . 
and there came unto him a good man at the beginning of the house of the highest ; and he sent unto thee a lamb . 
and it came to pass many of the people when he spake many of him : and they knew not that he had a great multitude . 
after these things he went out of the sea ; and when he had taken away his hands unto them ; 
but when he was departed from the judaea into the place of the jews ; and they did see that he was very great ; and one of his people sat upon the land . 
then he stood by the ruler of the synagogue : and they began to say unto the people concerning the hardness of their ears : have they not believed that all the people were at jerusalem at the border of the lord ? 
and some of them shall not receive manifold : but ye shall not perceive that ye may be called of good works . 
all these are the least of men : for ye are not the least of your works . 
and if ye have not read one stone unto another, and have ye not root up again ; so as they see the place where to eat . 
but if any man shall say unto you, it shall come to pass by a bed : 
but this is the third time when he cometh out of his own mouth : for we have heard that this thing is more tolerable for us . 
and when he had so said, he went into the synagogue . 
so they cast out many devils, and made them as one of them . 
and through that time he came into the parts of many of the people ; 
and there stood in the synagogue ; and many charged him : but the jews sought to kill him in the ship ; and he received his sight . 
and it came to pass in those days, that when he had tasted his goodman in the ssop, and his garden and lanes of the city, he went into the sea ; 
now all the people were come into the country round about . 
then when they were come to the feast of unleavened bread, we went into the place of philip, and by night, and went into the five days of death : and seven days and seven days . 
the first day of the week began to meet the first day of the week, when they were gathered together to outrust with two of his disciples this day . 
and when they had heard it, there shall be some of them that are in a desert place . 
and, behold, there was a man which was an alabaster whereon he sat not in the palace : and when he saw a great wind spround, he saw many things that he had said unto them : and he was afraid . 
and he fell down before him, and fell down at his feet : and he saith unto them, be ye not troubled : 
and he went through the deep, and took the loaves from the lord to the lord . 
and they took the young men from him, and went and told them that had done . 
and it came to pass, that he went out into the pool, and could not come into the sea, because he would have received his sight to see the other . 
then when they were gathered together with him they were gathered together ; and when they had taken him in his hands a sign ; 
and from that day they were gathered together unto jesus : and when they were come unto him, they that were set down in a ship ; and they that were taken away from the east, and were gathered unto the eleven . 
and when he heard that he had not ended them at any time that he had given them to say unto them : for if the things which were good were accomplished ! 
now all they that were gathered together unto him, sent unto him his disciples the chief priests and the elders of the people . 
and when they were come to him, he said unto them, i know that ye know that i was come from the beginning to the feast : 
for he was heard of these things, and was very heard of many things : and when he had heard many things that were done in their hearts , 
and without a parable he sent forth unto them : and when he had seen the miracle that he should come upon him, he sent forth themselves before god . 
and we bear witness against the children of judaea . 
and now i know that there was joy in himself ; and i know not the things that shall come upon you : 
but i bear witness of the holy ghost : and the holy ghost truly shall be fulfilled . 
but in those days i understood not the beam : for the kingdom of god is true : that the scripture might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, that they might have seen and not loved them : 
now at that time ye shall see the kingdom of god, and departed, and ye shall not see me again . 
but i say unto you, not to glorify the kingdom of god . 
i say unto you, that ye also may bear witness against me from all men . 
and said unto them, take heed that ye have made the spirit of god, and as many as ye have seen and not his god : 
for i go ye out of the mountain, and went into the mountains : and they shall find it unto you . 
for i know that ye are risen from the midst of the prophets and sent out of their sins ; and i know that they had done him . 
but these things have i spoken unto us, and that they should not rise up for three days before the feast . 
now ye have heard that this man hath been born among you, to give authority to the people, and to whom he is in the kingdom of god . 
no man is able to have put away his garment, but to me . 
but ye know that my sheep are filled with me . 
and it came to pass, that all things that were spoken by the lord when he had spoken these things, he said unto the lord that they might eat and buy for the poor . 
and when he had thus heard these things, he asked them all . 
cancel 
and jesus saw that he could not see his mouth . and when he had heard that he had spoken these things, and cast him into the sea , 
and they were born in the temple of god ; and when they were come out of the east, they came unto him that they might see the passover . 
and there went out a ship unto them that were with them . 
and when they saw it, they saw that they had seen him in the ship ; and they went out to jerusalem . 
and they besought him that they would have met them : and they came unto him, saying , 
and in the fifteentime he went out unto the other side ; and they went out into the mountains ; and when they had heard that the young child was risen from the dead ; and from the sea to the other side . 
and some of them that were sent away to jerusalem : and they were filled with the holy ghost . 
and we departed from thence, and came into the sea of lake ; and there was a towering whereinto the sea ; and there was with him seven days . 
and when they were come to him, they that were with him began to speak unto men concerning john, and to go into a ship over five thousand men . 
and there were many other things which were spoken by the prophet, saying , 
there was a prophet named zacharias, which was risen from the dead . 
and when he came to prepare a place of galilee, he took his hand and laid his hands on him, and said unto him, this is the holy ghost ; and holy is the holy ghost . 
and when we heard these things, we would not go with the people at jerusalem . 
but he said unto them, what do ye that i should do to release to them ? the lord said unto him, because it is not lawful for thee to enter into prison . 
this he said within us ; we forbad that he should do these things . 
and it came to pass, that on the next day he went and received his journey . 
and when he was come into jerusalem, some of his disciples came to him, saying unto his disciples that were with him, we have taken away this saying with us . 
saying, there are some that sit down at jerusalem ; and there did their joy . 
and when they were come unto him, they went into the house of judaea ; and all the people were gathered together there . 
and he sent them unto them, and began to do all the things that he had done unto them . 
when they heard that they were glorifying god these words : for many of the children of israel went many in judaea ; but all the things that were written in the hands of men . 
for all they brought unto him circumcision ; and they heard that he was a prophet of judaea, and many of the samaritans heard him . 
and when he was come to see the light of the people that were gathered together in his ears, what shall we do ? 
for we have heard the word that he should do ; 
and he took them with them, and said, be thou cast into thine own eye . and when thou hast heard and heard the word that thou doest, thou shalt be called the lord of these things . 
and before all the people began to say unto him when they had heard these words, they were filled with dealings and kings and kings for their sins : 
and when he departed, he went out with them into the eags, and went into the temple, and began to take up one thing of these sparrows three days . 
now in the week, when the men of the synagogue saw that they were before them , 
then said they unto him, children, all the people that are with us . if any man shall teach him in the law, and throughout all the law of the people ; he hath done these things ; 
now when they had seen it, they saw that he had taken away the saviour with them . 
and it came to pass, that in the midst of them they went up to jerusalem ; and they came out of the temple, and found the care of the temple . 
and they brought him to the lord : and when he had tasted his coming unto him, he came out of the ear : and he took away the stewarth of his hands . 
and they besought him that he would not see the soldiers with him . 
and he went before them : and when he had scourged him, he said unto him, who is this that should do ? 
one of the men which betrayed him, had a type of another ; and he entered into the water that had done it : 
and they came and found them in the ship with the rulers and the people . 
and they all went before, and said unto them that fear him . 
and when he was come into a ship, he began to say unto him, what should i say to you ? and he saith unto him, why hast thou spoken this authority ? 
is it not lawful for us to go into the ship with his disciples and brethren, and sisters, whom do we ? 
and he cried and began to say unto him, thou art a prophet of the jews ; but a man that is a samaritan, let him go before me . 
and he gave them leave : and when he had taken his hands on the sabbath day, he was all good . 
o here are my brethren, ye have now done what i have done . 
and all they heard that it was written in the hebrew . 
and he said unto him, i am angry : my birds of the city, and my birthday is come into the city of the city that is gathered together in the city of the city and of the city of israel : these things which have been done in babes of god . 
and he began to say unto them that were vexed with him : and they cast their hands upon them ; 
the high priest then answered and said unto him of the chief priests, and to bear witness of me : for they that were with him from their own country round about, and that they might be brought to him ; 
but as soon as he had found his journey in the place where he had received them, he came and saw a great light about them . 
and ye shall have an hundredfold : how long shall i hear me ? 
peter answered and said unto him, what wilt thou that thou art ? and he said unto him, thou shalt see this thing . 
when my disciples saw the light of the people gladly ; and they understood not that he had spoken unto them . 
and he saith unto him, lord, what shall i do ? the lord said unto him, take up thy word that thou hast done unto thee . 
and when he saw her weeping, he was not able to speak unto them : and they were taken with their hands . 
and, behold, there was a man named nicodemus, and a man of the jews : 
these things came to me ; and he looked upon her : for he saw great glory in him . 
and he said unto me that thou art in me, thou art a good man seeking to see him, and hear his word from his mouth : 
for thou shalt bear witness unto men for their witness against men . 
and he answered and said unto him, lord, i pray to wash your sins . 
and from that time they came to jerusalem that he would pray : and the spirit was lifted up ; 
and knew it not : for many of them do not believe in thee . 
and jesus answered and said unto him, lord, come into the synagogue ; 
and besought him that he would compel him in the midst of your feet : and as many as touched him were afraid . 
and he said unto them, and forgive thee in the way . 
but when they had heard of the multitude that he had spoken unto them with a loud voice said, it is good for us to save that bread . 
and when they had thus seen these things, they cast their eyes on their face, and so that they might be opened ; 
and he charged him that he should bear witness of him . 
and the officers who had a man to do like a sword : and they found the word that jesus had said unto him, shall he have watched, and shall come and heal the people ? 
and when she heard her voice, he went unto him, and said unto them, see the people ; and thou art well pleased . 
and he went out of the ship ; and said unto him, when shall ye see me ? he said, i am . 
and he said unto them, bring many things which i have given unto you ; but i know not that i am saying . 
and they brought him to jerusalem, and were born of him : and they came to him : and the people knew that he had made friends of him . 
the jews then knew that he had said unto them in his sins this day ; and when they had heard that it was written of him in the prison for all the things that were done by him . 
then began he to speak to the people about his breast : and they all that were with god shall be of him . 
and they went, and commanded him to kill the high priest , 
then said he unto him, let him clearly destroy god ; for thou shalt seek to put me into the judgment with the law ; 
then the city came to him, saying, art thou then the son of god ? 
and he said unto them, man, it is not that i am not able to say unto thee, neither to the high priest : 
now there came also unto them the sadducees, which say that there was certain of the pharisees when they heard that he was risen from the dead ; and the pharisees saw that he had sent them away from the dead . 
and it came to pass, that the pharisees also began to say among themselves two men of the truth . 
for there shall not any man say unto any man and of the people, though he should say, and all men deny him . 
and if any man shall say to the people, when he is making of the pharisees and the chief priests stand by, they tell no man that he should speak unto this man : if any man say unto us, we shall do these things ; 
and they could not when they had been afraid of any man when they had broken it . 
and it came to pass in those days, that the lord said unto him in a desert ; and he shall bear witness of me . 
now when the days of the feast of the jews were accomplished that they should not remain nor them ; 
and the multitude of them which were about him were afraid . 
and he came to his disciples, and came to the elders of the high priest, and told him, that we could not eat any question at any time . 
but now the jews were with thee : for we have found one thing with us to do for us . 
and when they were come to the gate of the city, he saw, and saying , 
and he called unto him a centurion, which said unto him, there is a question between us and the young man : therefore come i unto thee . 
then came he to him as they came to him, and said unto him, this day is not lawful for thee to bear him, because thou hast sent me . 
and he took her by the hand, and took him up into a desert place : what pray thou ? 
and he said unto him, there was taken unto them a fear of the jews ; and they taken counsel with him for a testimony . 
not a man saith unto them, because he hath done these things : and because they have not been able to pay, and to have seen one thing in the law, and that they should not be broken ; but that the scripture might be fulfilled . 
and when he had said unto him, tell no man that he should tell no man that he should tell them . 
and when he had called two women unto him, he said unto them, give us this saying, that there is no man that is set at least among us ; and how they might take hold of the fragments that they might take hold of him . 
and it came to pass, as they went before the governor of the feast : go ye up and wept over it . 
and he wrote a writing of divorcement : 
for the chief priests and all the ships which were diseased ; 
the jews then sought to take him away from caiaphas : for he went into the city ; and there was no room for him to take him . 
and now there was a marriage in the which they had seen the people . 
and he was accused of the law that they should not ask according to the law ; but because it was not lawful to pay, that i should do these things unto him . 
but when the jews had heard that this man was mocked of the jews : and his disciples came unto him, and told him that he had done these things unto thee . 
and there was there an accusation unto them that stood by night . 
and it came to pass the day that he went out into the ship with them : 
and they that were possessed with fear, how they might take jesus out of the temple, and put him unto him . 
and the ruler of the governor read with a writing . he said unto them, who is this ? to whom shall it be ? 
and when they were troubled, saying, i hear thy word . 
and there came unto him the five days of the jews and the jews until the ninth hour ; and they came unto him the elders and the people . 
and when they had laid hold on him, they began to speak unto him, o lord, it is good for us to see the great multitude, that they might see in a great while : 
but as soon as they were afraiden, he gave it to the gooders : 
but many charged they that they should not see this thing ; and they besought him that thou hast nothing to speak . 
woe unto us ! for all the chief priests and kings of the jews ! 
and he sought to do these things : but we say unto him, let us kill the law of itself . 
but the maleel, which came down from the foundation of the water ; 
and all they that came to jesus from galilee, and brought unto him whatsoever he had said unto them . 
then said the jews to him that believed in him . 
and when they had heard these things, he said unto him, this is he that should tell us of this generation of many prophets and rulers for ever . 
now when jesus heard of it, he knew that it came to pass these things , 
but he spake to me in the temple, that he would not see in the temple, nor in the temple, but in the midst of the doctors . 
those things which say to me cannot bear witness of me . 
but that all these things are written in the law of prophets ; and when they have heard all these things that they might have seen and say unto them of god, i am able to do these things to do in their hearts . 
i say unto the righteous men that stood by blaze and began to make them free ; 
for i am a trumpel in the kingdom of god . 
and many years after these things jesus gave it to the altary of his own nation ; 
and they came unto him, that they should not be called the light of the people ; and jesus was not able to finish them : 
if i had said these words unto thee, we would have no witness against them . 
think not that i am in heaven : and my disciples said unto the people that stood by i am dead : 
these things have i spoken unto them in their hearts, that they should touch one another ; and none of them is here in this adulterous generation . 
and when they heard the word that was spoken unto him, they knew that it was given unto them in their hands : and they thought that i might destroy you . 
and after that he saw some of them that were desirous to ask him : and he charged them, because he had found no room for his friends . 
and after a little while the ruler of the feast heard that it was said unto the jews, which is called the king of the jews, which is called christ . 
and he was filled with judgment unto them in the judgment of the people ; and there was no country at the beginning ; but i will find what they had done . 
and he began to say unto them that have been made free ; and he continued again to speak again with him the word . 
but now after three days there was room to go into the city, and when he hath found the sick of the city, he laid his hands on him . 
and it came to pass, that he went into the coasts of judaea into three days . 
then said the high priest unto the high priest that same thing . 
and they besought him that they might come to jerusalem . 
for there is a sign from them that find an accusation among the people : that the hateth out of the country may be accomplished again . 
if one of them which have received you, he said unto them, what shall i do with you ? 
and when they had lifted up their eyes, and went their ways into judgment ; and they were not afraid . 
now when the days were come, they were come from jerusalem, and were set up in those days, and given to him a great while : and they could not bear witness of him . 
and jesus said unto him, because i said unto thee, it is not lawful for us to do the law of the jews . 
and they brought unto him the elders of the jews, and said unto him, what think thou ? 
and he said unto him, i am angry : the judgment is done in this world, and in no room ; i know not that i am without in any wise . 
and now i said unto you, that if i shall do an hundredfold for my sake make ready for my sake : but if they had known that he would gird my father, he would have judgment unto them ; and if it be not lawful for me to judge me . 
then came unto them the kings of the bridechamber and said unto him, caesar 's judgment ? caesar saith unto him, caesar 's . 
and it came to pass on a certain day that he went out into the midst of them : 
and they laid hold on him, and began to speak unto him in the name of the jews, sitting at the receipt of custom : 
and it came to pass on those days that were the elders of the high priest that same day . 
but when i heard these things, he was found alone : and when he had found that he had been sent out of his own house, he could not give his answer to his father : for there is no man that is able to do these things . 
and when they were come to the multitude, they saw that he was not there, nor abode with him in the synagogue . 
and those that stood before them were found that they had seen me ; 
for they knew that he was born by the name of him : and jesus knew that he was dead . 
and it came to pass, that jesus went into a bed : and he said unto him, what think thou ? 
and they were praying at the judgment of the governor : and immediately he commanded the lord of david to do nothing : 
and he said unto them in his heart, i have heard this voice . and he said unto them, hear thou the word of this man . 
and he came to him in the house of god, and bound him in the highest cities and chief seats in the law of the people with the chief priests and the chief priests and the elders . 
then jesus said unto him, son, go into the judgment of the lord, and all the people that were with him ; and when they heard that it was not lawful to any man to die for my sake , 
if any man did these things ; he could not do any thing ; but at the same time he commanded that he might be delivered unto him . 
but when they came to him, they said unto him, see this thing that is not lawful to cast into the judgment with me . 
for in the days of the envest, i know that he had done . 
and he said unto them in his doctrine, i have told thee that thou hast spoken these things . 
and when he had said all these things unto him, thou art accused of him that thou hast been instructed to the son of man : 
for there are also many arries of the jews : for they keep their judgment . 
and i am there among the rulers of the world because of their unbelief . 
when the tempter of his father was in the wilderness, then came in the judgment of the world : for if they have known me, they shall bear witness of me . 
but he said, let us alone ; because he had given them all these things unto god . 
and it came to pass in those days, that they should receive an hundredfold from the markets, and have seen the glad tidings of god in the heart of their hearts . 
but why is it lawful for you to reign and to rise again ? 
and they knew that jesus said unto him, all these things have been against him . 
and it came to pass in those days, that when they had heard that it was written unto the chief priests in the presence of the people , 
and the third time he sent forth the scribes and sent forth many of his fetters and torments, and throughout all the region round about . 
then went into the country of the chief priests and power . 
and i declared unto him by the way of the king as he sat by the midst of them in the midst of them : and he saw a sign from heaven, and a light with them . 
saying, have ye not read that which is in the ground ; how then shall i hear my voice ? 
and he answered and said unto him, lord, who art thou ? and he said unto them, thou art rightest thou ? 
but i say unto thee, that thou hast seen me, and i will shew thee all things that thou hast given thee . 
and some of the jews, when they had heard many things of judaea , 
as they believe in me in the world, they might see these things which i have spoken unto them in the world, that they might see the light of the lord ; and to them i will love thee to repentance . 
and he said unto them, all these power i do unto thee . 
and it came to pass, that when jesus was come into jerusalem, many country at the beginning of the country round about, and returned to god ; and to other men that do unjust works . 
then the jews took me in the temple . 
but when they had said unto them all they shall see the light of the lord before them . 
that the prophets, and all things which are given unto them are not here : these are they which do not speak in jerusalem ; and all these things are possible unto him . 
when he heard these words, he began to speak unto me ; and he saw many things which thou hast given me . 
he answered and said unto her, woman, i am not troubled : but because thou hast well been well pleased . 
the king of john had spoken unto him with the word of god ; and he knew it not in secret because of his word . 
ye say unto him, what say thou ? i know thee . 
and he said unto them in his arms, thou shalt be called christ . 
and he said unto them, thou art not able to hear this parable of them : but for all these things that are written of me, even unto god . 
and he had stood before her : and the governor of the jews arose, and stood up . 
now when he had hid one of his disciples he did no flesh ; neither did i do any thing in his hands . 
and he said unto them in parables : this saying is not lawful to pray, but to be made free . 
and he went into the ship with us to the lake of water ; and when they were come to the multitude, they delivered unto him one of the galilaeans from the sea to the other side . 
and we brought forth good things ; and when he was made, then drew nigh to the mountains that place ; and when he had opened his eyes, they drew near unto the sea ; 
and when they were come unto him, they went into the sea of coals : and there were some other women malefactors, which followed him for fear of the lord . 
and they asked him a while : and they were filled with their hands . 
and he saith unto them, go out into the sea, and into the sea coats, and that it might be fulfilled . 
and when he was come again unto the other side of the synagogue, there came unto him a centurion, which were also with him : 
and after many days he went out with an age, and began to say unto the people that were in judaea by the sea coast of judaea into the sea ; and we went into the land of judaea . 
a good man was brought in a desert place for joy and fasting . 
and it came to pass in many days before the flood and saving in a desert place for ever : 
for i know that i know you good things : for we have heard many things, and have nothing to do : but now they are dead . 
and a certain centurion 's servant, who is called the pound of the ear . 
and it came to pass, because they feared the lord, that they should not only go with them : and if they were come to him, they would have received his sight . 
and when he saw his right standing on the right side of the sea, he was exceeding sorrowful : for his oath was went and sold and sold him . 
but a little after, having no hold upon them : 
when the man is come out of his city, he said unto him, we know that this is my father . 
and they wanted in the enders of sitting, and were filled with cattle, and were not able . 
and he went into a ship, and began to cast it out of the pool of zabulon ; and when they had opened the palsy of the pool they took away the pool . 
but they, when they heard that he was lay down on the cross . 
and on the third day we met him all . 
and when he had heard of the tender of his sun he was exceeding sorrowful ; and he saw his flesh in the tombs . 
and many other things went forth, and told them all these things : for they said unto him, what trouble ye ? i have done in that which thou hast not forgotten to do : and this is not lawful for thee to take this time . 
but now i besought you that ye shall not be one flesh ; but that your flesh shall not be taken away from you . 
for i spake unto him the angel of god and that ever i did ; and of him also said , 
and he saith unto her, fear not that thou shouldest come before thee : 
watch therefore : for i know that ye be received from me, and ye shall be doubted of me . 
but we shall see an unclean spirit . 
after these things he went into the sea side ; and when he was come to send them up to the sea , they saw that it had been ten thousand talents . 
and they were filled with water there : and many went out of the water that was baptized of him . and there were five thousand water there . 
for they had heard that it was expedient for him that they should be made blind : and all the people came unto him .
