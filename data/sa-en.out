and they cast out many new children unto our fathers : and they cast out enough, because they had done this unto the children of abraham . 
in this came as moses 's kingdom : and he was exceeding good in the days of her house . 
and when they were cast out, they took him up, and took him for the young child of phas, and gave him his son . 
and moses was within, because he had seen all the things that he had taught and spoken of them . 
and when he was full forty years old, one of the children of israel drew to his brethren . 
and when they saw one of them was blind, he was not able to save him, but was deep and unalive . 
and when the hand of the god shall come, he suppose that his sins should be fulfilled : but they understood not . 
and the next day began to say unto them that stood by night ; so that when he is come to the jews, he went his way, and brake, o ye of a great one of them ? 
and he that was healed without a wife, and said unto him, away from us : and who made thee a judge over us ? 
wilt thou kill me, as i am ? 
and, behold, there was a voice which heard these sayings, he went into a far place ; and there was two sons . 
and when he was forty years old, there appeared to him an angel of the lord in the wilderness with a loud voice of the angel of the lord . 
when moses saw it, he marvelled : and when he saw it, he came to it, and brought unto him , 
saying, i am the god of thy fathers, the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob ; and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob ; he was not afraid . 
and the lord said unto him, put thy shoes on thy feet : for it is the holy ground . 
i say unto thee, that this man is grievous of my people : i have heard the mind, and have heard them that they had heard and said, i will send thee away . 
according to the saying of him to whom thou hast commanded thee to be reported : as soon as moses had given him the word of god in the presence of the angel and also how they might have received him . 
and he brought them out in the sea side ; and in the midst of them he went out, and shewed them how great things he had done unto them in the wilderness . 
the lord of that lord shall raise up unto you a prophet from your brethren, and said unto them, ye shall say that he is the children of israel . 
this is he that was in the wilderness, as he was in the midst of the sea, and brought in a mountain, and heard him in the midst of the angel of his fathers : 
and they cried out the words of our fathers to abraham, and from their hearts , 
and now let us go before us ; and as many as moses cast out of the land of that land ; and they knew not how it was for him . 
and they made oxen of the stone, and put me into the temple : and they were filled with their hands . 
then he spake unto them the words of god in heaven ; as it is written in the book of heaven ; as it is written in the midst of the prophets and in the midst of the prophets, and in the midst of them that dwell in the mount of babylon . 
but the authority of the lord is upon you . 
now there was a great idle in the wilderness, that he should make all the things which he had seen before jesus . 
and some of them that were with jesus began to eat with joy, and to remember the word of god in the presence of the gentiles, and of the gentiles : 
for he promised to build a tabernacle of god for the glory of god . 
but solomon built him a spirit into the temple . 
and it is not written in the temple, that he was in the temple, nor in the temple, but spake the prophet , 
the lord of heaven is upon me, and my footstool . 
he hath not read in all these things . 
ye have heard that the heart is waxed gross, and the world is left with you : for your fathers do so . 
and they called the prophets of your father ? and they that were of the just man went out into the hands of the just man ; and ye said, i am a righteous man . 
and it came to pass, that ye should be delivered by the holy ghost . 
and when they heard these things, they were grievous to see the beasts . 
but when he was full of the holy ghost, he saw the glory of god, and standing on the right hand of god , 
behold, i see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing on the right hand of god . 
and they cried out with a loud voice, and struck with his ears, and ran upon them with one another . 
and cast him out of the city, and cast him out of the city ; and the oxen brought their own clothes on a prophet . 
and he said, lord, this is he that made the house of my house, and prayed him : and they killed him . 
and he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, saying, fear not what evil thou hast kept this . 
and their laying was on . at that time there was a man which had been in jerusalem, and at jerusalem they were vexed with great fear ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the parts of the gentiles . 
and it came to pass, that many men of men took their clothes . 
but in the house he made a judge of men and of men : and when he had made them whole . 
and they that were scattered abroad went every where it was . 
then philip came and dwelt in the city of samaria, and taught them . 
and the people reasoned with themselves, saying, why do ye kill the devil ? 
and when they saw that there were many that were possessed with him ; and they were afraid . 
there was a great joy in that city . 
now there was a certain man named simon a certain man of the city called didymus, and out of all the country of david ; 
and he began to say unto them, this man is the great power of god ; and to all the children of israel . 
and he began to judge them for a long time ; and they killed him . 
but when they had preached the word of jesus unto the kingdom of god, they were baptized with women and women . 
then simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized of him, he was astonished, and saw what miracles and miracles were done . 
and it came to pass, that when the apostles of god, they had received the word of god, they sent unto him peter and john . 
and when they were come near, they might receive the holy ghost : 
for fear not, save that his lord in the name of jesus . 
then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy ghost . 
and when he saw that they had given their hands on the multitude, he took them for the holy ghost : 
and i give unto thee the gift that i lay hands on me, and it is given unto me the holy ghost . 
but peter answered and said unto him, thy money perish : because thou wast the gift of god with money . 
it is not lawful for them that fear the will of god ; neither is it for your heart . 
repent therefore : for in thy heart is forgiven thee ; lest at any time thine heart be forgiven thee : 
for i perceive that thou art in the friend of my father 's bond . 
then simon answered and said unto them, pray thou that i should not depart from me, nor serve for you . 
and they, when they had heard these things, and preached the word of the lord . 
and the angel of god spake unto philip, saying, arise, and go into the way right hand of the south to jerusalem . 
and he arose and went out : and, behold, a certain man of the people which were of sedition and all the wisdom of the people came to jerusalem for to jerusalem , 
and again he entered into a city of esaias the prophet . 
then came the spirit to philip, and said unto him, go thy way into the sea . 
and when he was come to him, he sent to him, and heard the word that it was written in the hebrew ? 
and he said unto them, how can i command thee ? and he asked philip that he would come and sit with him . 
he read the scripture ; as he was like unto them, he was led into a lamb 's womb ; and his raiment was like a lamb ; 
but he was brought down from the judgment : for the son of man shall be taken away from them, for he is taken from the dead . 
and philip answered and said unto him, i pray thee that he had spoken the prophet this man, or of whom do he also say ? 
then philip opened his mouth, and began to say unto him, concerning jesus . 
and as they passed by, they came to the water : and the blind men came unto him, and said, where is my baptism ? 
and peter answered and said unto him, if thou be with thine own self . and he answered and said, i believe that thou art the son of god . 
and he commanded them to go in, and came into the water, and there came two water ; and they gave him water . 
and when they were come out of the water, the lord of the lord led him away into the water, so that he might see her : and he went his way : 
and when they were come on the other side of the gadarenes : and when he was come into the coasts of gerga . 
and at that time came he not to the high priest 's accusation against the disciples of the lord . 
and it came to pass, that he went into a certain man, and desired him that he should put them to jerusalem for the city of israel . 
and as he journeyed, he came into the city : and suddenly there was a light from heaven round about him : 
and he said unto the multitudes, why tempt thou me ? 
he saith unto him, lord, who art thou ? and the lord said unto him, i am he that betrayeth thee . 
and he saith unto him, lord, what wilt thou that i should do ? and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the city, and it shall be done unto thee . 
and when the men which were with him heard it, they saw him not : but while they saw no man . 
and he arose, and saw no man when he had opened his eyes, and saw no man : but they led him out of the ship . 
and he was three days ; and the blind men came neither eat nor drink . 
and the lord commanded him to be called one of the disciples at meat, and call his disciple . and he answered and said, lord, see . 
and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the way of the lord over the other side of the sea ; that he might know that he was a ruler of the house . 
and behold, he came to pray : and when he was come to him, he came and saw his hands on him, and healed them in a dream . 
then said one unto him, lord, i have done many things unto the people of jerusalem . 
and there are also many that sit in the name of the people ; for he hath received the word of the people . 
but the lord said unto him, go thy name to the gentiles, and to preach my name unto the people of israel . 
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name 's sake . 
and when he was come into the house, his hands came and laid their hands on him, and said unto him, thou art in the presence of the lord, that thou mightest be filled with the holy ghost : 
and as he had thus spoken, he went out of the eyes of the altar : and he lifted up his eyes, and arose, and gave it up : 
and when he had called unto him his disciples and his disciples was in the city , 
and all the synagogues, and preached unto jesus the son of god . 
and all they that heard him were amazed, and said, is not this he that destroyed them in the name of god come to jerusalem, and was come from the chief priests and elders ? 
but they, when he had beheaded these things, he constrained god that he was christ from the dead . 
and after that many days were fulfilled, the jews took counsel to kill him . 
but when they had heard how that he had beforetold them how they should kill him ; and they abode in the city at jerusalem . 
then the disciples took him by night, and let him sit down in the wilderness . 
and when he came to jerusalem, he would not go with the disciples unto them : but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple . 
then took he him by the hand, and brought him to the lord, and how he had seen the lord : and he said unto them, thou shalt know how great things he did at jerusalem . 
and he went out with them at jerusalem . 
and they sought to kill him : for he was a judge against the chief of the people . 
but when the brethren knew that he had taken him into his own city , 
so when he had heard that he was throughout all judaea, and went throughout all the coasts of god throughout all the region round about them, and went there up many days of the holy ghost . 
and peter stood in the place where they were in the synagogue at the face of the city . 
and there came a certain man of the sick of the palsy, which had an issue of blood . 
and this is he that was made whole from him, and made thee whole : and, behold, he arose . 
and when they saw it, they turned away to the lord their god . 
now there was a woman named tabhara, which was in every city of altar ; and there was a woman named zorobabel, which was a jew, which also of the samaritans . 
and it came to pass in those days, that they left the fire : and they laid it in a charger, and laid it in a sepulchre . 
and as they were come to it, peter was nigh to the city : and when he heard that peter was there, he sent two of his disciples unto him . 
then peter arose and went with them . and when he was come nigh unto him, they brought him into a desert place called the upper room ; and when they were set at nought to have seen the tax, 
but peter put them all out, and prayed ; and he lifted up his eyes on the other : and he looked upon her : and when she saw the woman coming in the midst of her , 
then peter took his hand, and lifted him up ; and when he had called the holy ghost unto them . 
and it was written in the city ; and many believed on him . 
and it came to pass, that he tarried in a city of simon a sower in simon . 
now when he was come into the town, there was a man of the common man that should see him . 
for he was a man that is a worshipper of god ; and the people, when he had heard the word of god . 
and he saw in a third hour, and saw the angel of god as he had seen him : and he came and spake unto him, body . 
and when he saw him, he was afraid . and he said unto him, lord, why hast thou heard thy prayer and faith in thy sight . 
now send one to the ruler of the city, and taught him in one simon a place called the sea ; 
he shall by what means he shall do unto thee . 
and when the angel was departed, he called unto him : and as one of his household, he called unto him two of them that were with him ; 
and when he had given all these things unto it sent to him . 
and when they were departed, he went up into the city, and drew nigh unto the city : and peter went up to pray about the sixth hour . 
and he was hungry : and he would have eaten ; and it came to pass in a cry : 
and looking upon him all the heavens that sat upon him, as it had been a great pool, he saw it down in heaven : 
and they were all filled with wild beasts and wild beasts of the air . 
and there came a voice from heaven, saying , 
but peter answered and said unto him, lord, it is not lawful for thee to go after these things . 
and the voice of the second time, when the voice of the lord, heard not what thou doest . 
so it was done in the midst of the jews, and prayed , 
and it came to pass, that, as soon as peter had seen what he had seen in his sight : and as they were men that were sent from jerusalem , 
and simon asked him, and said, what is this your house ? 
when peter thought that the scripture might be fulfilled, he said unto him, behold, three men seek thee . 
go thou to the other side ; go thy way, and send them to go . 
then came peter to him as they were come to him, and said, behold, i know whom ye seek : what is that ye seek ? 
and they said, an angel of the lord when he saw a good man, and of many that were with him, and of them that were with him, was warned of the jews, and besought him that he would send away his word . 
then he sent them into their synagogue, and found them . and on the next day he took them, and went with them to his brethren . 
and on the morrow when he was come into the midst of them : and they knew that he had called them . 
and when peter was come into the house, he met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him . 
but peter said unto him, arise, and stand up ; 
and as he talked with him, he went into the synagogue, and saw a great multitude that were with him . 
and the chief priests said unto him, ye have seen how that it is written, or have been done in the house of the jews : but if any man knew that it is not lawful for thee to put me to death . 
therefore came i to you without understanding ; for i came not to you : ask him, saying, what is it for you ? 
and he said unto them, many days have i been born in the days of ago i to this hour : and in the morning, behold, a man of his glory, stood before me . 
and his ears are opened, and they came to hear his ears, and in a shew of sight of god . 
and he sent forth his disciples to joy, and entered into the sea ; and there was a man which is called the one of the sea ; and he shall come and teach thee . 
immediately sent forth to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . 
then spake peter unto them, saying, the god of god was inner among men . 
if any man have seen the people, and he that doeth truth is worthy of him . 
ye have heard him by the name of all the lord jesus christ . 
for he preached the baptism of john, when he was preached throughout the land of galilee . 
and god was with the holy ghost : and jesus went into jerusalem, and healed all the minds of the devil ; for god was with him . 
and we have heard all things that were done in judaea and in the land of judaea . 
and the third day god raised up the kingdom of god . 
not to all the people come forth unto us, but after that he was risen from the dead ; and they did eat and drink with him ; 
and he commanded us to preach unto the people that was dead ; and he commanded us to preach and testify of him . 
and he that believeth on him shall be revided in his name : and all the prophets shall be false . 
while he yet heard these words, he befell by the holy ghost : 
and they that believed with him at the circumcision of the gentiles : and when they were come with the holy ghost , 
for they speak with many tongues : and when they heard it, they were astonished at his doctrine . 
but peter said unto him, can any man go into the water, that they which have received the holy ghost ? 
and they began to be baptized of him in the name of the lord . 
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea received the word of god . 
and when peter was come to jerusalem, they that were with him heard the people questions . 
saying, arise, and go with them in the house . 
but peter was conceived in the prison for all the things which were done . 
i was in the city called praying : and as soon as it was day, he saw a cloud of the cloud that he had died, and had seen a great wind , 
and when he had seen it, he looked up, and saw many beasts of the earth, and wild beasts of the air ; 
and peter went up, and heard a voice saying unto him, arise, and see me . 
but i answered and said unto him, not ; for there is no man that forsaketh himself at my mouth . 
the voice of one that hath seen and heard these things . 
and when they had thus spoken, they were all amazed again . 
and, behold, there were certain of them that were come from the house where i entered into the house . 
and the spirit commanded them to be saved ; and he said unto them, let us go with my brethren : and we went into the house of man . 
and he spake to him one of the angel ; and as he had said unto him, send forth a man to his house , 
and he shall teach them all by their house to be saved . 
and he said unto them, the holy ghost is come on us, as it were written on us at the beginning . 
john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost, and ye shall be baptized with the word : 
forasmuch as the lord knew that he gave them the gift of the lord jesus christ ; what was it that he gave them to them ? how am i to god ? 
and when they heard these things, they took up the word of god unto them, and said, it is not lawful for them to obtain life unto life . 
now they which were scattered on the other side : and when they were come into the ship with the people, they saw none other things but the jews but unto the jews : 
and some of them began to say unto the chief priests and elders of the people when they were come to jerusalem . 
and the lord was with them : and many believed on the lord . 
and it came to pass, that on those things which were come to pass, as they went into the ears of judaea to jerusalem . 
then when he was come to tell the people that he had seen with god . 
and he was filled with the holy ghost and with the holy ghost : and much people were filled with joy for the lord . 
and after they had found him in the city, he departed into the city : and when they found it, they found him , 
and when he had found it, he took a great multitude with them, and commanded them to go to this year . and the disciples of the people, when they were called christ . 
and the prophets came down from jerusalem unto jerusalem . 
and there arose one of them that stood by, and dwelt in spirit and in all that land : and they came unto the cloud that it might be fulfilled . 
then the disciples were filled with their own selves for the remission of sins . 
and they sent him away to the chief priests and the elders of the people . 
and in that time herod the king stretched forth his hands into the prison . 
and he killed james the brother of john the brother of james . 
when the jews therefore saw it, he perceived that he should take peter . 
now when the feast of unleavened bread, he came in prison, and gave him a great while : and when he had spent him to the people, he took him by night to meet the people : and there was a great number of them which were set before them . 
but if peter had been in prison, they besought him that he might receive his sight . 
and when herod would have brought him out to go out, peter stood by the sea side : and peter was bound with two chains : and the soldiers stood before him, and stood before him . 
and, behold, the angel of the lord appeared unto him in the days of the lord : and he smote him on the right hand, and awoke him : and when his hands was broken up from the dead . 
and the angel said unto him, gird thyself, and bind on thy foot . and as soon as the angel had died, he saith unto him, follow me . 
and peter went out, and followed him : and the angel knew that it was true . 
so when they were come to the first and the second craft, they came to the gate of the city, which was come to the gate of the city : and they went out, and passed through their own country ; and he sent me into the way . 
and when he was come to jerusalem, he knew that his angel was sent from the dead, and from the dead, and from the dead . 
and when he had perceived this, he departed from the mother of james, and john 's mother in the house of mary . 
and it came to pass, that when they were come out of the peter they found a young child . 
but peter heard of him, and fell on him ; and when he had heard him, he could not depart out of the voice of peter . 
and they said unto him, thou art mad ; but she cried out the truth . 
and when they had thus spoken, the angel of the lord appeared . 
and as soon as peter was delivered to the gate of the city, he found peter also . 
and peter heard him not : and when the lord knew how he had given him a prisoner, he spake that he should take his hands . 
and when it was day, peter was past with him in the prison . 
and herod was not able to seek herod : but was warned of them to kill him . 
and he went down into the coasts of judaea into galilee . 
and the people waited for fear of god, when they had seen the lord because of that nation ; and he came nigh to his house, and found none other man at any time with his garment : for he was healed of them . 
and said unto them, peace is on me, that herod the king of the jews, sitting on the throne of god . 
and the people cried out, saying, not unto this man ; 
but when herod saw the lord, behold, the angel of the lord appeareth from him to jerusalem, and was sick, and upon whom he had raised away the dust of their hearts . and when they had heard that there was grace and grace from them which were written by him , 
now there were in the city that was called simon, which is called simon, and said that he was a jew, 
and when they had seen the holy ghost with them, the holy ghost said unto them, separate me with such things that i have made them . 
and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away . 
and they sent forth the holy ghost : and some of them went out into the sea side by the sea side . 
and when they were come to jerusalem, they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john with john . 
and when they were gone out of the synagogue, they drew to jerusalem : and when they had seen the lord of sala, there was a great multitude of the prophets, which was called didyla : 
and they desired him that he should hear the word of god . 
but lyscia reed that he might depart from the way of the lord . 
and he was filled with the holy ghost, and filled his eyes with power . 
o fools, thou shalt be merciful out of the evil spirit : thou shalt not then call the way of the lord the truth ? 
this is the lord of the lord : for thou shalt not see the sun and the moon . 
then when she saw what was done, he marvelled at the doctrine of the lord . 
now when they had heard that it was expedient to the people, they took away the pool of olives, and went from them to jerusalem . 
and when they departed from thence, they went into the midst of them, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath days . 
and the law and the prophets were read by the prophet, and the children of the synagogue besought him that they might say to his disciples , 
then jesus stood up, and beckoned with his hand : and he said, ye men of israel, and ye shall see . 
this people of israel took the word of god in the land of israel ; and when he had given his arm unto the people that were in judaea and in the land of israel . 
and about the fifty years went the great ship over them . 
and when he had made them over all the land of judaea, he put them into all the midst of them . 
and after that he had appeared in the fifty years after the fifty and six years before the prophet ; 
and the same day was rived : for god gave unto them the son of david : and there was a king of the children of david ; 
and when he had reported him, he shall do all those things which i have chosen ; and that of him was my beloved son : whom jesus hath given to the kingdom of god, he took up his kingdom . 
now as his thus heard this, he was one of the children of israel unto the people of israel . 
now when john had first seen the people of israel . 
the days of john fulfilled that which was written in him, he said unto them, how think ye that i am ? i am not able to say unto you, behold, one of whom i have given me, is not worthy of his feet . 
ye are the children of abraham, and the name of god is greater than all men . 
for they that stood at jerusalem, and they knew him not what was written in jerusalem, because they had been written in the law of the prophets and the prophets concerning him . 
and when they had found any cause of death they should have killed him . 
and when they had fulfilled all these things, they took up the stone from the cross . 
but god raised him from the dead ; 
and when he was come from galilee to jerusalem, all that came down with him to jerusalem, all his witness unto the people . 
and we knew that the son of our fathers had made thee an hour : 
the word is written in the second day, when it is written in the book of jesus ; and of them we have taught thee this authority ; 
and when the lord therefore of the lord shall rise again from the dead, he shall not depart from him : but he said unto them, i will give you the will of the lord . 
and he said also unto the other side : for thou shalt not send them into the holy ghost . 
for david, after he had delivered unto himself the will of god, he was good : 
but he, whom god raised from the dead saw he not . 
take heed to you : for the remission of sins is preached unto you . 
for ye know that from all the law of moses was made known of you ; 
go ye therefore, and see : behold, i have compassion on my face ; and ye shall receive, and shall receive, because there shall be no man at any time of death . 
take heed therefore how it is written in the prophets, that ye shall not hear it . 
and when the multitude were gone out of the synagogue, the gentiles besought that they might be heard and preached to the jews : 
now when the ruler of the synagogue, many of the jews followed him with many of the jews and doctors : and they that were with them, persuaded how many things were done by him . 
and the next sabbath day was gathered together to hear the word of god . 
but when the jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake of him for the word of god and blasphemy . 
then began he to speak unto the people, and to say unto the people, we have preached the word of god : if it were not lawful for you to do any man : 
so likewise also the lord commanded us to make me a light of the world . 
and when the word heard these things, they were glad, and glorified the lord : and many that were with him, believed on him . 
and the word of the lord was throughout all the region . 
but the jews departed, and honourable men of the city, and with the chief men of the city, and sent them out of their coasts . 
and they took off the cloud of their feet against them : and they went into a city . 
and the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy ghost . 
and they went into the synagogue 's synagogue 's synagogue : and many of the jews have believed on him in the synagogue and of the gentiles . 
but the jews immediately took up the judgment of god, and went into their heart . 
and it came to pass in the presence of the lord, that he had spoken many signs and wonders ; and that his word was done by him ; 
but the multitude of the people were gathered together for fear of the jews, and besought him that they should not be with them . 
and the king of the jews took up their hands upon them, and killed them ; 
they were gone out of the city, and fled from lycaonia, and from the sea of lyssia : 
and preached the gospel . 
and there was a man in a charger, having a spirit of water ; and a certain man heard it by the feet, and heard it . 
these words cried out to him, that he had faith in the world . 
and said unto him, take up thy bed, and walk . and he went out into the sea . 
and when the people saw what they had done, they cried out, saying, the man is come down to us in the wilderness . 
and they called barnabas, and said unto peter, it is the king of the jews . 
and the priest of that city was brought to the ruler of the synagogue, and brought a light of the high priest, and distripes to the door of the jews, and would have done for him . 
but when the multitude heard that, they rent their clothes, and heard that they had seen him , 
and saith unto them, why do ye these things ? arise, and teach them, that ye may be saved, and be converted, and power upon you : 
for he hath done all men in the right hand to all the people . 
who, when he had given up many things in heaven like a benemy he gave you saft, and hath filled your hearts with tears, and hath given to your hearts . 
and he spake also unto them : and they knew not that the people was come to him . 
and there came also a certain jews of the synagogue, and some of them that were there, and delivered him to the multitude, because they had been dead . 
but when the disciples were round about him, he arose, and went into the city, and returned to the city : and the next day he departed to be taken away . 
and when they had preached the gospel to many of the people , 
and gave many things to the gentiles, and to go into the kingdom of god : and they confirming the disciples . 
and when he had ended them all with temptations and elders, they believed on him ; and straightway they believed him . 
and after they had passed over, they came into lamps . 
and when they had heard these things, they went down into the temple : 
and from the sea side : and when the hand of the hand of the lord was delivered to the gentiles to finish that which they had done . 
and when they were come to jerusalem, they were filled with indignation and ministration unto the people, and how it had been given to the faith of the gentiles : 
and they followed him, and abode with him there . 
there came unto you certain of the children of judaea : and when your law is dead, ye cannot be saved . 
when therefore the people with them were many judge of thee, and they brought unto him many things ; and that this man might know that these things had been written of them, and that he should not send them to jerusalem . 
and when they were sent unto him, they rejoiced that they might have received the word of the lord, and their brethren . 
and when they were come to jerusalem, they were numbered with the chief priests and elders of the people, and from jerusalem ; and all things that god had done by them . 
but there arose a certain of the pharisees which believed on him ; and when they had spoken these things, it must be lawful for them to accuse him . 
and he sent forth the apostles and elders of the people ; and they were afraid . 
in many days peter stood up, and said unto him, how many of the disciples believed me in the presence of men, that they might hear my word , 
and god hath given unto them all the things that are spoken by god ; 
and ye know that no man hath ought to say within us and among us . 
wherefore think ye that we have not been able to bear through our fathers to come ? 
that we might receive from the lord, even as we found with them . 
then all the chief priests and elders had seen the miracles which jesus did, and had done these things unto them in their own mouth . 
and when they had finished all these things , 
simeon thou my words : for god hath written in the book of many of the people to take away his name . 
this is written by the prophets ; as it is written of them . 
this is the end of these things ; and he shall gather them up at the beginning . 
that the residue of our sins may be turned away from us : and the servants will of the lord, and i will give it again . 
from the beginning of the world to all his works . 
wherefore my pray is far from among the gentiles that they should repent on god : 
but that we may write unto them, that they bring forth meat from the evil of the fashion and from saints which fear of god . 
for as many as are preached in the law unto moses : these things are in the synagogues and in the synagogues of the sabbath . 
then sent the apostles and elders of the people, and began to send them forth as one of their brethren, and to say unto him, judas and his disciples . 
and it came to pass, that after those things were written concerning him the prophet and simon . 
and it came to pass, that after we went to jerusalem, that we should go to jerusalem, and bring your law to the law of god, and keep your hearts : and we trodden aside the commandment of judaea . 
it seemed good to us that we should be conceived in one proverb by the name of the lord jesus christ . 
for he knew that many of them which were with him, and had sent to you . 
but judas christ sent you away ; and they shall know all things that by mouth . 
for it seemed good to the holy ghost, that we should bring forth meat from heaven, and to eat of such things as ye have done ; 
that ye may be saved, if ye keep them good . 
and when they had sent away the multitude, they came unto him : and when they had gathered the multitude of the people together, they delivered them all . 
and when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation . 
and judas was preached of himself ; and when he was set, he commanded them to be blessed . 
and when they had spent some of them that were with them, they went away into the way of peace from them to jerusalem . 
but they, when he would have looked for him . 
and it came to pass in those days, that many of his disciples, and preaching the gospel of the lord . 
and after those days came some of them to say unto him, we have preached the word of our lord, to go into every city a city of god . 
and when he was called unto him in the ship of john 's disciples , 
but he went not with them, and went not with them to past with them . 
and it came to pass, that after they were there, they departed from among themselves, and departed, and went into the sea of tiberias ; 
and it came to pass, that after they were assembled by their brethren unto the grace of god . 
and he went out unto them, and spake with many of them . 
now when he was come to jerusalem, there was a certain man, and he was a jew, and a certain woman having believed on the king of the jews : but his father was a greek . 
and there was a man named lazarus, which were among the brethren . 
then he took him to his own house, and took him in the midst of the jews ; and they feared him for all the father : for he was a sinner . 
and it came to pass, as they went through jerusalem : and they delivered him to the chief priests and elders of the people that were at jerusalem . 
and all the church, when they were born of the church, they were filled with a great while ; 
now when they were come to bethphage, the chief priests and the holy ghost departed from them to preach the word . 
and when they were come unto john, they came into the parts of judaea ; and the spirit suffered them not . 
and they departed thence, and went into the coasts of judaea . 
and, behold, there stood a man in the midst of them : and they besought him that he would come and heal them . 
and after he had seen the salvation of the lord, he sent us to preach the gospel to the gentiles, and to preach the gospel to the gentiles . 
and it came to pass, that after we went out of the city that is come out of tyre and sidon, he went into the sea ; 
and from thence he went into the city of nazareth : and the place where philip was the chief city of nazareth . 
and it came to pass, that as they went out of the city, he sat down by the sea side : and when he sat down, he sat down, and spake to the damsel . 
and there was a woman named tala, which was a great company of some, and a great company of didanna, and a certain woman, which stood in the midst of the children of israel : and the disciples heard of the lord . 
and when she was baptized, she besought him that she would be baptized, and said unto them, if ye have judged with you, i come into my house . and he continued not with her . 
and it came to pass, that as soon as they had a great multitude of people didanna, he went out to say, a certain man of the palsy ; 
and jesus followed him, and cried with a loud voice, and said unto them in the wilderness, shew yourselves unto the way of god ; 
and when she had spent many words, he turned him away from him, and said unto him, i command thee to come out of the name of jesus . and he came out of the prison . 
and when they saw that the people had seen the belly handname of their lord, they brought him to the judgment seat : 
and brought them to the magistrates, and they feared the people : for we have suffered all things to do for us . 
and they did not teach the jews when they had heard these things ; 
and when the people had thus spoken, they departed against him ; and the chief priests and the rulers laid their hands on them . 
and they took many stripes of stripes ; and when they had taken heed to them for to save them . 
and when he had heard these things, he took the water into the inner : and when he had broken the palsy . 
and at midnight there were many that were vexed with god in the presence of god : and they heard them . 
and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation was made with the foundation of the law . 
and when the soldiers were come with sleep, they saw the disciples of the bridechamber that were at the door of the governor : and they cast out his sword, and killed him . 
but jesus cried with a loud voice, and said unto him, behold, we are all here : thou art no evil in thy soul . 
then he entered into a light, and sprang up to meat : and when the multitude came down from me, he fell among the people . 
and he brought them out, and said, what shall i do to be saved ? 
and they brought him to his house, and set him before him : and he was seen of the lord god of all his house . 
and they spake unto him the word of all the people in his house . 
and he took them in the same hour ; and when he had washed their hands with them ; and he was all baptized of him . 
and they brought him to his house, and set him before him : and he was seen of the lord god of all his house . 
and when the day was not accomplished that they should answer the people concerning him . 
and the servants of the city, when they heard this saying unto them, the chief priests have sent you out to cast them out ; now come ye out . 
but when they heard these things, they said unto him, get us not after, because we have left no dealt in him, and have cast us into prison ; but let us come out of the city, and let us go out . 
and the officers told him these things concerning the pharisees : and they feared the people : 
and they came and besought him that he would depart out of the city . 
and they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of peter : and when they had seen the lord, they comforted them, and departed . 
now when they had passed through the midst of them, they went into the parts of the jews : and there was a synagogue of the jews : 
and he went his way unto them : and on the sabbath day he did these things which were with them . 
saying unto them, these things have i spoken unto you, that he should rise again from the dead, and from the dead . 
and some of them that stood up, and many of the chief priests and the chief priests followed him . 
but the jews which believed on him were ended, full of envy and wine, and they brought unto him a great city of the saints which were set at nought ; and they that they might bring him unto the people . 
and when they found some of them that heard these things, and brought unto the rulers and the rulers of the city, they that heard them were at nine ; 
this he hath received them, and received them, and said, a certain king, which is called the king of jesus . 
and the people heard these things, and were baptized of the rulers and the rulers . 
and when he had sent them to jerusalem, and sent them to jerusalem . 
and the brethren also took him by night ; and when they were come into the synagogue, they went into the synagogue of the jews . 
now there were many of the people that were in judaea : and they knew not that it was about the day of judgment ; and the scriptures were made manifest to them . 
therefore many of the jews believed on him ; and of many of them . 
but when the word of god was preached of the word of god in a certain place, when they had heard that the word of god was risen from the dead . 
then sent he to the brethren that they should go to the sea ; but when they were come to the sea , 
and they saw him by their way, and laid him in the city : and when they had found him, they had received him a great while : 
and it came to pass, that, as he was praying at meat : for all the things that were done in jesus 's sight were filled . 
and he judge the jews in the synagogue with the jews, and the elders of the jews, and in the marketplace . 
then certain of them which were with him at the beginning, and they brought to the sick of the company . and some said, what will this be this ? and some of them say unto him, he hath preached that this man is a liar, and he preached the resurrection . 
and they brought him unto him, and said unto him, rabbi, we know that thou art an old man : 
for we would have believed in our ears : we would have known what these things were done . 
and when his disciples heard that they were in jerusalem, and they that were with him, believed not in him for a while ; 
and he began to speak unto them in the spirit, and said, ye see that i am the son of abraham, which is called of the holy ghost . 
for as ye have seen meat at the time of prayer, and said, i know not this man that is called the altar of god . ye know that i go to you . 
for he that made the world and all things that are world should be made of heaven and earth, because the governor of heaven was not in the temple : 
he all the life and the life : so that he may give it to all that she hath, and shall not bear much people : 
and it came to pass in those days, that one of the men of israel, and of the blood of man according to all the things that were commanded ; 
that they might seek the lord, how they might seek for him : 
for he hath not lighted us ; but we know that he was troubled in our hearts : for we know that any man is his breast . 
if we were come from god, we should be the son of god, which is an offence unto the offence of men . 
and of them were the god of the children of god : but now the wind sprang up into all the country , 
for when he was come, he will cend all men in the way of him ; and on the day he hath raised him from the dead . 
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to say unto him, we have heard of this jesus, and we will hear thee . 
and he was in the midst of them . 
but some of them were with him, and as they believed with him : and a certain man was divided among them ; 
after these things jesus departed from the city to jerusalem, and came to him . 
and there came unto him a certain man of the jews : and they came after him to see the jews, and asked him that he was a disciple of his lord ; and when he was come from the sea of tiberias . 
and the same was enough for them, and because there was one stone ; and he abode with them . 
and he went into the synagogue every sabbath, and taught the jews among the jews . 
and when he was come from jerusalem, there were many that were come to him, and testified that jesus was christ . 
and when they had raised from the earth, they began to say, this man said unto them, why hast ye made this dealt of the blood of god ? i am clean also unto you . 
and he departed thence, and went into the house of god, that he was not a ruler of the synagogue . 
and he went to the ruler of the synagogue 's house, and believed on his house ; and many of the city of nazareth were baptized . 
then said the lord to the lord, fear not : fear not according to thy word . 
for i have no man to touch thee with thee, but i am with thee . 
and he began to say unto them about twelve years . 
and when jesus saw it, he would have watching the jews, and said unto them, the jews took up a judgment against one of the galilaeans . 
and they were ready to say unto him, that god was against the gentiles . 
and when he had called these words unto them, the elders of the jews, said unto the jews, if a certain man had a question with you, had i not so much as to say unto you : 
but if it be a question against you, or of your law, i will not judge him : but if ye be a dead man . 
and he put them out of the judgment seat . 
and there went out unto him the chief ruler of the synagogue, out of the country round about, and they took jesus out of the judgment : and they were all scattered abroad . 
and he tarried there yet many days ; and after that there was no decree from the dead, he took his head in a place where he had lain ; and he holling with the water . 
and he went down into the city into the city : and he entered into the synagogue, and walked with the jews . 
when they sought to take him again with them, he said unto them , 
and it came to pass, that after that he was come to jerusalem, i will finish you : but he said unto them, i will ; and he sailed by the way of god . 
and when he was come to jerusalem, and went into the city of the church ; and he went down to jerusalem . 
and after he had spent some things unto them, he went out into the judgment of all the disciples , 
and it came to pass on a certain quarrel that he went into the house of alexander . 
this was written in the mouth of the lord ; he was as a baptism of john, and taught by the baptism of john . 
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : and when he had heard that he had spoken these things unto them, then came he to him, and spake unto him the word of god . 
and when he was come to the other side into the sea, he wrote unto the brethren, and didancing that the disciples should take him out of his own country, when they had heard how much more things he had done unto them ; 
for he had seen the law that jesus was christ ; and he left the jews, and delivered him to the jews, . 
and it came to pass, that, when jesus was come into the sea of galilee, the disciples came, and came to him : and some of his disciples asked him , 
said unto them, is it not lawful for us to believe ? and they said unto him, we have heard the holy ghost . 
and he said unto them, how were ye baptized ? and they said, the baptism of john . 
then said he unto him, after that he will come after him, that he should believe that christ should be baptized of the baptism of john . 
when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus . 
and when he had laid his hands on them, the holy ghost came on them ; and they understood that there was no tongues . 
and they were about twelve . 
and he went into the synagogue, and spake by the way of god for a while ; 
but when many were able to believe not, but that they should not believe in all those things which were before them : then the disciples departed from them, and delivered one to the baptism of repentance . 
and after two years they heard him not, and of all the jews which were with him heard these things . 
and god wrought this works for the works of god . 
and they brought unto him brought unto the sick of his boat, and were brought unto the sick of the palsy : and they went out of the palsy . 
then certain of the jews then took jesus out of that city a certain king, which had called out of the devils : and when they had heard these things, he said unto them, let us go with jesus . 
and there were seven men of the synagogue and the chief priests of the jews . 
and the man said unto him, i know that i know and know not ; but who are ye ? 
and when the man heard that he was possessed with the devil, he fell down on them, and overcame them : and they cast out the house of their hands . 
and when she heard of it, all the jews also came to them with jesus of nazareth : and they were all afraid of the lord jesus . 
and many of the people came, and shewed themselves that they had done these things unto them . 
many of the rulers also took the book, and burned them before them : and they were burned before all men : and they were filled with five pieces of silver . 
so was done by all the word of god . 
but when he had done all these things unto them, he went out to jerusalem, and to go to jerusalem, and to go into the ship : but when i was come, i will see this man . 
and as he had sent unto him two of his friends and two of them were in judaea . 
but while they went on the other side . 
for it came to pass in those days, that the oxen of the temple was made good for all the men of the temple ; and how he saw no man that was dead . 
but he called them all which were commanded him to be called together : and he said unto them, ye know that this fellow was made known by us . 
but god spake unto you, that god was not in the name of god : and in those days he was not able to speak unto them, and have many other things that are written in the presence of the gentiles : 
but that the word of our father might be fulfilled, which is not lawful for us to be set at nought : 
and when they heard these sayings, they were all amazed, and cried out, saying, that this is the son of god . 
and the whole city was filled with full of wounds : and when they were come to ship, they that were in the name of the lord, they ran with two men . 
and when he would go to the people unto the people : but the disciples suffered him . 
and some of the chief pharisees which were with him sent unto him, saying, i will come unto thee a certain man that is in the field . 
and it came to pass, that when he spake many of the people of many of the people, he could not leave this man more than these . 
and it came to pass, that he went out of the multitude, and put his hands on him ; and would have made them a light unto the people . 
but when he knew that he was a jew, all the people knew that he was a great man, about the space of five thousand men . 
and when he had found the rulers of the synagogue, he said unto them, ye know not how that the people were at jerusalem at the time of the lord, and they that were at jerusalem with the great fear of the lord ? 
and whosoever shall not speak unto any man : but ye shall not perceive that ye must be called of good works . 
for ye have brought hither these things which are set before you : 
and if ye be with one cheer and brethren, and ye hold to the people, and there are an judgment between them, and the place where they go . 
but if ye have any thing spoken unto you, it shall be forgiven him for a sign . 
but this is the third time that we should come out of his own selves : for we have been able to give us this cause . 
and when he had thus spoken, he went into the synagogue . 
and when they were ceased, they called the multitude of the disciples to go into egypt . 
and as he departed from thence, he came into the parts of many of them . 
and there stood in the synagogue ; and many charged him : but the jews sought to kill him in the ship ; and he received his sight . 
and by the same time he went out into saviour, and dwelt in babylon and in sackon, and in saints which were in babylon and salama ; 
now all the city was at jerusalem . 
and we went away into the days of unleavened bread, and came to philip, as he went into the sea of galilee, and abode seven days : and seven days i abode there . 
the first day of the week, when the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to take bread, he began to finish his disciples by the third day . 
and there were many lights in a upper room ; and there shall be many lights . 
and there sat in a window a certain young man sitting in the market ; and as he passed by, he began to speak with many things : and he was well pleased with the third time, and was taken away . 
and he fell down before him, and fell down at his feet, and said unto him, be not troubled : for your life is in him . 
and he went up on the how he had broken the bread, and had spoken these things unto the lord . 
and they brought the young men to him, and were affrighted . 
and we went through the sea that we might take him in peace : for he himself would have received his sight to go into the midst . 
and when they were gathered together with us they were gathered together ; and when they had taken him into the ship of the other . 
and from thence, they came the next day ; and the next day they arrived in a certain city, and went out quickly into the streets of the sea, and were gathered together unto the sea . 
for when he had constrained his disciples to go into the city, he delivered them for to go : for if it were possible, the day is at jerusalem . 
and some of them were gathered together unto him, and written of the elders of the people . 
and when they were come to him, he said unto them, ye know that i was come from the first day that i came unto you : 
for he was answered by the mouth of many that heard him, and did eat many things of the jews : 
and many other things spake he not unto them : and they published out of the house, and believe the word that he should be delivered to god in my house . 
testifying and bear witness against the jews to his hands . 
and now i go not into the spirit : for verily i know not the things that shall come upon you : 
but i bear witness of the holy ghost in the city that she should suffer and suffer . 
but after these things i suppose not that i am expounded in my heart : that the kingdom of god should bear witness of all things which the lord hath given to the gentiles to preach and to the gentiles : 
behold, i know that after that ye have seen the kingdom of god, and have sought to see my words . 
but i say unto you, i will not send them to all nations . 
for i have witnesses unto you through all the heart of all the people ; 
take heed to yourselves, and to all the holy ghost which ye have made : 
for i go out of the mountain, and entered into your garments : and they shall find great things unto you . 
for i know that none of you is risen from the midst of the prophets and disciples to kill him . 
but these things have i spoken unto us, and that we should not see until the day following ; 
now ye have heard that the holy ghost, whom god hath given to you to observe and sidon : 
no man is able to take a piece of his garment, and to i have no man . 
but ye know that my eyes were with me . 
these things have i spoken unto you, that the lord when he had spoken the word of the lord jesus, he said, it is told you all things that to give to the poor . 
and when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all . 
and they were inviled 
and said, see i see no more in his mouth : for it was which he spake, and lacked his hands on the sea, and kissed him . 
and it came to pass, that after they were come from the east of the synagogue, we came to send away the coat : and the next day was come, they came unto him . 
and they went into a ship ; and when they were come into the ship . 
and when they saw him, they had rown upon him : and they went down into the ship, and drew nigh to the sea . 
and they besought him that they would have tarried there seven days ; and jesus said unto them, go not up to jerusalem . 
and when he had went about the seven days into the ship ; and they went our way ; and they were filled with children, and brought us into the sea ; and there came unto them the sea side . 
and when they had sent away one of another, they took up their abode . 
and we departed from thence, and came to the sea of tiberia : and when we had passed through the sea of god, we took with them one day . 
and the next day there came unto him seven men that were with him : and they came unto him, that he should go into the house of philip . 
and there were also many that were spoken by him ; 
and it came to pass on us, that there was a prophet from judaea from judaea . 
and when he was come to us, he took cought, and laid his hands on him, and said unto them, it is the holy ghost, that the jews should come and destroy him . 
and when we heard these things, we would not go up to jerusalem . 
but he said unto them, what do ye that i should do to drink of me ? the lord of the lord said unto him, i am not ready to die for this day . 
and when he had said these words unto us, we will also say unto this man, it is done . 
and it came to pass, that on the next day he took bread, and departed to jerusalem . 
and some of his disciples of judaea came to say unto us, we have found one of the disciples which were with us in the name of the elders . 
and when we were come to jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly . 
and when they were come with him, they went into the house of judaea ; and all the people were present there . 
and he sent them unto them, and began to do the miracles of the god which he had given unto them . 
when they heard it, they glorified the lord, and said unto him, thou seest many of the tribes of this generation ; and how many of the disciples of all the law are done . 
and all they heard him for the circumcision of the jews : for he was an honourable man that is a prophet among the jews . 
and it came to pass, that the people which were come to him, should come and come . what is it that we might take him here ? 
such things have we to do with them : we have seen the days of life . 
and he took them with them, and be with them . 
and many of them which believed on him, when they had said these things unto us, we have heard that they had been put in dealt and reported with their deals : 
then began he to take the bed, and go with them . 
now when the seven days were ended, the chief priests and the pharisees saw him in the temple, and led him away unto the people, and took him away . 
cried out, children, all men of israel ; this is he that destroyed all men from the law, and throughout all the law of the people ; and he taught it . 
now when they were come together, they saw that he had been with them in the temple at the first . 
and it came to pass, that, as they went round about, they came and took him out of the temple : and immediately the doors were shut . 
and when they were come to him, they came unto the chief priests, and besought him that he might take away the palsy of the palsy : 
and they besought him that he would come with soldiers : and when they saw him with the soldiers . 
then he went before the chief priests and bound him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains : what did he do ? 
and one of the multitude had a type of the multitude ; and he could not speak for the tumult : 
and when he came nigh unto them, he charged the soldiers for fear of the people . 
and all the people followed him ; for they cried out to him . 
and as he was teaching, he said unto the chief priests that he should speak unto thee in the city ? and he saith unto him, why hast thou known the jews ? 
art not thou that sent me, that he which is a jew, about five days and four thousand men ? 
and he answered and said unto them, i am a friend of the jews : i am a ruler of this city ; and i beseech thee to speak unto this man . 
and he gave them leave . and when he had laid his hands on the multitude, they were all afraid . and when he had said unto them , 
think not that thy god hath now done unto thee . 
and all they heard that it was written in the hebrew . 
and he said, i am a man which is a nare in judaea in the city of david ; in this city of david the city called the disciple of his disciples : and as many as ye have heard of the law of god . 
and when he had commanded these two men to be cast into prison ; and they bound their hands against them . 
the high priest then began to bear me witness, and to speak unto them of the elders : for out of those that were with them, which from among them that were come to jerusalem ; for they that were come to jerusalem . 
but as he had found it, he came nigh unto them, and came out about the sixth hour, and came by a great light round about me . 
and i fell down at the ground, and heard a voice from heaven, saying, why tempt thou me ? 
and he answered and said unto him, lord, who art thou ? and he said unto him, i am jesus of nazareth . 
and they that were with me saw the light of the people : and they understood not that he had spoken to me . 
and he saith unto him, lord, what shall i do ? the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the city, and there shall be told thee of what thou hast done . 
and when he saw it not for the glory of her glory : and they that were with him were taken away from the cities . 
and one of them that stood at jerusalem, and a man according to the law of all the jews . 
and i came unto me, and saw thy brethren walking in the city, and saw him up in the river . 
and he said, thou art a good man in me, that thou shouldest see his will, and see that his mouth hath seen the voice of god . 
for thou shalt be witnesses unto all men for their witness against men . 
and he answered and said unto him, lord, give me to wash your sins in the name of the lord . 
and jesus came again to jerusalem, and prayed , 
and thou shalt know that thou hast heard these things : for they will not receive thy testimony . 
and i answered and said unto him, lord, send them into their synagogue ; 
and when the blood of thy blood was comped, he was filled with the midst of them : and great fear fell unto the people . 
and he said unto them, forgive thee ; and i will send thee unto the gentiles . 
and when they had heard of this multitude, they cried out, saying, away with this generation : for it is not lawful for a man to save it . 
and when they had thus spoken, they cast out their eyes unto the gods , 
then the chief priests commanded him to bear witness of him . 
and as they heard him that he was a bound with him with an oath to say unto the multitude, what is it that ye shall receive ? 
and when she heard these things, he went to the chief priests and said unto them, take heed what ye shall do . 
then the chief priests came, and said unto him, art thou a galilaean ? he said, yea . 
then he said unto the chief priests and to whom i have given : and it came to pass, that he said, i am not come . 
then they departed from him with the stripes of stripes : and the chief priests knew that he was of him : and the people knew that he had been made friends of him . 
on the morrow, when he knew that he was accused of the jews, he sent him to the chief priests and said unto the chief priests and all the things that he had said unto them , 
and he looked on the men that were with him, and said, man, i have received all the word from god until this day . 
and the high priest also commanded them to kill him the holy ghost . 
then said paul unto him, thou shalt be cast into the presence of god ; for thou shalt judge me according to the judgment of the law ; 
and they that stood by say unto him, art thou the high priest ? 
then said he unto them, man, i wist not that he was the high priest : for it is written, thou shalt not speak unto the rulers of the gentiles . 
but when he saw some of the pharisees which were of the pharisees heard that the pharisees heard that the multitude stood by, he said unto the chief priests and pharisees, i am a pharisee, and of the dead . 
and when he had so said, there was a division between the pharisees and the sadducees . 
for the resurrection of the pharisees and of the sadducees demanded no man : but the pharisees confess all . 
and there arose a great while ; when the number of the pharisees, and the scribes that stood in the midst of the pharisees saw that the scribes should not prevail of this man : but if a spirit or an angel had spoken against him, let us not against god . 
and when they had gone out of the temple, they brought the soldiers to meet him that he should take him in the temple, and commanded the chief priests to take him by force . 
and in the night the lord stood by him, and said unto him, arise, and bear witness of me as many as thou hast sent me . 
now when the day was come, some of the jews took counsel together of the jews ; and they did not eat nor drink with patiling them . 
and they were more than these which were soldiers . 
and they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, we have nothing to eat any thing that we shall neither eat nor drink . 
now therefore said the chief priests and elders of the people that were with him, we would have brought him to jerusalem, that we might bring him to thee : and thou shalt go thy way before thee . 
and when he had found a man in the wilderness to say unto them , 
then he called one of the centurion, and said, bring this young man unto the chief priests : for he hath a question at that time . 
then came he to him, and brought him to the chief priests : and he besought him that he would come unto thee in the insurrection . 
then the centurion took him by the hand, and went into a desert place : and he asked him, what is that to tell thee ? 
and he said unto him, the jews have taken counsel for thee, to put him into the parts of the jews : 
but do not thou agree : for many of them which have laid hold on him because they had received an oath and have nothing to eat ; nor have they laid hold upon him ; lest at any time they should be put to death . 
and the young man spake unto him, that thou tell no man that thou should tell no man : but the young men went their way . 
and when he had called unto him two centurion, he said unto them, make ready two hundred pence, and take two hundred pence, and two, one at the seat, and the third day he is divided against two men . 
and they said unto him, go before the governor to the governor ; and bring them hither . 
and he wrote a penny . 
which were the great signs in the audience of the people ; 
then certain of the jews sought to kill him, and brought him to be killed . 
and when they had known what the people would have known what they would say . 
and he was accused of the law that they should not ask according to the law ; but because he was not able to do these things concerning their kinsman or . 
and when the jews heard that it was told him how that the jews had been put to death : and immediately his accusation came upon him with their accusation . 
and the soldiers, as he had commanded them to take him by night . 
on the morrow, when they were come with him, returned into the band of men . 
and when they were come to jerusalem, they came unto the multitude, and delivered the governor of the feast . 
and the ruler of the synagogue, being read of the governor said unto them, who is this ? and when he had seen a man of galilee , 
and, behold, i hear thee, when thine accusation is heard of thee . and he commanded him to be set before her . 
and after five days the high priest descended with the elders of the high priest : and they came unto him the elders and the elders of the high priest . 
and when they had brought him to the place, they began to accuse him, saying, master, this is the great man that destroyed us at the time of a great while : 
for it came to pass, that in those days he was made whole ; and hath filled it up . 
but i say not to judge until many things come upon him, that they may hear thee of me . 
for this is the king of the whole city of juda : and of him all the kings of the jews shall rise up in the wilderness . 
and he sought to heal the temple : but we say unto him, let us kill according to our law . 
but the ruler of the synagogue, when he was come down from the sea , 
and when they were come to him, they brought him unto thee . 
and the jews also ascended all these things . 
and when they had spoken unto him at the mouth of the lord, he said unto him, that thou shalt know that many years of peace be upon thee . 
it came to pass in those days of john : for in those days i came that he had seen these things to jerusalem . 
but they found me not in the temple, lest at any time in the temple, nor in the temple, nor in the temple : 
neither can they bear witness of that which is done in me . 
but these are they which believe in the law and in the law of prophets ; that they should know that all these things which are written in the law of god, i am able to speak unto them before my father . 
for i also am a just man, and a just man that sat at jerusalem ; and they will fain god with them . 
and i am in the will of men to speak before god . 
and after many years there was a great multitude of mine own nation for my sake . 
then certain of the jews came unto me in the temple, which was not lawful for him, nor tumult . 
and if they had said these things unto thee, they would have no witness against them . 
neither said they in that way : for i am a man that stood before me, before the people , 
i spake unto you, that none of them is in the midst of them, but this is written in this world, that no man should be here : 
and when the people heard these things, they knew that it was told them how he had known what things he saith unto them, i will judge you . 
and he sent unto him a certain man 's house, and commanded him to go to death, and to take him for his friends . 
and after a season he sent unto the ruler of the synagogue 's house, and heard that he was a disciple of the jews, who was called christ . 
and as he had said unto them in the judgment of come, there was no murder, being in prayer ; for i will go thy way ; for he shall find a word . 
he exeded that these things should have been spoken of him ; and again he sent away his money unto him . 
but after two years there was room to go into the city, after that some of them entered into the prison . 
and straightway jesus came into the kingdom of galilee, and went up to jerusalem after three days . 
then the high priest and the chief of the jews went before him . 
and besought him that he would come to jerusalem, that they might receive him . 
for a certain man at the way when he was taken away from them : and finding to kill him . 
if one of them which have ought against you, he said unto them, go with me, and accuse him . 
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days ; he went out, and commanded them to be set at nought . 
and when he was come, the jews were come down from jerusalem : and the jews were taken up against him a great multitude, and they could not bear witness against him . 
jesus answered and said unto them, because i have done nothing against the temple, or the law of the jews . 
but some of the jews sought to set him on the jews, and said unto him, wilt thou go up to jerusalem ? 
then said jesus unto him, i am angry : because i am not worthy to be judged : i know not in the judgment of the jews ; thou hast known openly . 
for if i have no cause of death in any man to take away his flesh : but if they have done this thing as my father hath given me, it is not lawful for them to judge me, but unto caesar . 
then when jesus had conferred with the council, he said unto them, wilt thou see caesar ? unto caesar 's judgment ? 
and after certain days there went out to meet jesus and his disciples : 
and when they had taken him, they took him, and spake unto him the king of the jews, saying, there was a certain man named babyla : 
now at that time the high priest of jerusalem, and the elders of the jews with him , 
but when i heard these things, he said, it is not lawful for a man to lay down his accusation against the people : for there is no man to answer for himself to the father which had spoken against him . 
and when they were come on the multitude, they abode not on the judgment seat, but commanded the man to be brought forth to him . 
and when the accusation of those things which i said unto you, they feared not the people : 
but this man spake against him of whom he was dead . 
and i was terrified for a while : and he said unto him, wilt thou go and see ? 
but when he had looked for unto the multitude, he commanded them to be brought into the judgment of the lord ; and he commanded him to be put to death . 
then said he unto him, verily i have heard that this man should hear him . and he said unto him, thou shalt hear him . 
and on the morrow, when he was come again into the city, he was come into the chief city, and with the chief priests and elders of the law : and there was gathered unto him the ruler of the synagogue : 
and jesus said unto him, king of the jews ! and all the men which were with him, ye see that this man was now dealt with me ; and yet no man spake for thee this time . 
but when he had done that he had done nothing ; yet the more a judge of judgment was at jerusalem at the judgment of the lord , 
but when they came to him, they said, what is this ? i have known what to write unto you in the judgment of my lord . 
for it is i know that the day is send up, and he know whence he had done . 
then said some of them unto him, thou shalt have heard thy word . and jesus stretched forth his hand, and tell thee what thou hast done . 
i am accused of thee this man, because he was accused of the jews : for this day is the son of man to bear witness of thee : 
for there are many things in the law of the jews : for they are instant of mind, and pray for them which ask me . 
but i told the jews that he had been at my company, because he was at the beginning of my kingdom . 
which were in the wilderness, as the uppermost root of our saints which i have done in the wilderness, they may bear witness of me for a season . 
but i am judged for the kingdom of god in a dream that he should god should rise again . 
and it came to pass in those days, that they may receive our twelve tribes of the night and day : and when they have seen the lord, i am accused of the jews . 
why should it be more lawful for you to take the dead ? 
i know that none of these things was spoken by jesus of nazareth against jesus . 
and it came to pass, that when they heard these things, many of the chief priests and elders of the chief priests stood in prison , 
and the third time he expounded them in the synagogues ; and when they had fulfilled their blasphemy with fetters and blasphemies unto the people , 
that he went through the way of the chief priests and scribes . 
and i was in the way called unto him : and in the midst of them i saw a light from heaven, and a light from them which are with me . 
and when we had performed all things, he cried with a loud voice, and said unto them, why tempt thou me ? a voice on thy right hand, where i have heard me . 
and i asked him, lord, who art thou ? and he said unto them, i am thou saying , 
but i say unto thee, that thou hast seen me, and i will shew thee all things to those things which thou hast given thee . 
and some of the chief priests and elders of the people, when they had taught thee , 
that they may believe in me ; that they might preach and to the wisdom of god . 
all these things i supposed unto you that they might have done these things . 
but when he was come to jerusalem, many of the country of jerusalem, and throughout all the country of judaea, and turn to god, and do works worthy of repentance : 
but the jews took me in the temple, and killed me . 
notwithstanding, as they knew that he rose up before them : then shall he see the wind and the glory of them . 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets and the prophets . 
and when he heard these words, he cried out with a loud voice, and said unto him, thou art beside thyself ; great is that thou hast given thee . 
but he said unto her, woman, i am not troubled ; but speak well of truth and truth . 
for the king spake unto him in the same hour ; and when he knew that the word of god is known unto him of these things : for i was not excent of this man . 
saying, what say thou of the prophets ? i know that thou sayest . 
then said some of them unto him, thou seest us that thou hast sent us . 
and he said unto him, i have told you that they should hear my words : but for all that are written of me, even unto god . 
and when he had thus spoken, the king said unto the chief priests and the pharisees arose, and be baptized . 
and when he had known among themselves, he said, it is not lawful for me to put any man 's death : 
then said some of them unto him, if this he would not be persuaded ; but if he were not far from caesar 's judgment . 
and it came to pass on us, that when they were come into the house of god, they delivered unto him a certain man of the chief priests and elders of the jews for to kill him . 
and it came to pass by the sea that we should go through by ship to other side ; and when they were come to the other side of the sea, they drew near to the sea ; 
and on the morrow, when they were come into jerusalem, they passed over, and found the son of jona with him a great joy against him . 
and when they were come, they went down from the sea to the other side : and they were filled with the wind . 
and some of them went out into the sea of cilicia and the sea of tiberius , 
and there came unto him a certain centurion 's journey ; which also was a ruler of the synagogue, and had received him into the ship . 
and when he had spent many days and went out of the synagogue, he went out into the sea side by the sea side : and it was the wind blost, and let us go through the sea . 
and it came to pass, that good was the city of lama ; which is not lawful for thee to dwell there : 
and when much while the days were now far spent, and was now in the ship, the ship was in the midst of them : 
for i know that i am good : for there shall be many days in our hearts, and shall not go in the ship ; but also of our life . 
now there was a centurion, which said to the drink of the palsy ; 
and because it was cold : and because it was not lawful for them to go in, that they should go into the ship ; and if they were come to winter ; that they might receive knowledge of the people . 
and when he saw that he was about his right cheer because they saw that he had gone about his right ched, they went and buried him by the way . 
but after a long time there was no deceas against them : 
and when the ship was come out of the ship, we could not drow : 
and they were in the midst of them that stood by beneas : and many boat did eat nothing :
