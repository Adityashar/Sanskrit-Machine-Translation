in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god .
the same was in the beginning with god .
all things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
and the light shi@@ ne@@ th in darkness ; and the darkness com@@ pre@@ hen@@ ded it not .
there was a man sent from god, whose name was john .
the same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe .
he was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light .
that was the true light, which li@@ ghte@@ th every man that cometh into the world .
he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not .
he came unto his ow@@ n, and his own received him not .
but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of god, even to them that believe on his name :
which were bor@@ n, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of god .
and the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth .
john bare witness of him, and cried, saying, this was he of whom i spake, he that cometh after me is pre@@ fer@@ red before me : for he was before me .
and of his ful@@ ness have all we recei@@ ved, and grace for grace .
for the law was given by moses, but grace and truth came by jesus christ .
no man hath seen god at any time, the only be@@ gotten son, which is in the bo@@ som of the father, he hath declared him .
and this is the record of john, when the jews sent priests and le@@ vi@@ tes from jerusalem to ask him, who art thou ?
and he confes@@ sed, and denied not ; but confes@@ sed, i am not the christ .
and they asked him, what then ? art thou elias ? and he saith, i am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered, no .
then said they unto him, who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
he said, i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the lord, as said the prophet esaias .
and they which were sent were of the pharisees .
and they asked him, and said unto him, why baptiz@@ est thou then, if thou be not that christ, nor eli@@ as, neither that prophet ?
john answered them, saying, i baptize with water : but there stan@@ deth one among you, whom ye know not ;
he it is, who coming after me is pre@@ fer@@ red before me, whose sho@@ e 's la@@ t@@ che@@ t i am not worthy to un@@ loose .
these things were done in beth@@ ab@@ ar@@ a beyond jordan, where john was baptiz@@ ing .
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him, and saith, behold the la@@ mb of god, which taketh away the sin of the world .
this is he of whom i said, after me cometh a man which is pre@@ fer@@ red before me : for he was before me .
and i knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to israel, therefore am i come baptiz@@ ing with water .
and john bare recor@@ d, saying, i saw the spirit descen@@ ding from heaven like a do@@ ve, and it abode upon him .
and i knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descen@@ d@@ ing, and rema@@ in@@ ing on him, the same is he which baptiz@@ eth with the holy ghost .
and i sa@@ w, and bare record that this is the son of god .
again the next day after john stoo@@ d, and two of his disciples ;
and looking upon jesus as he wal@@ ked, he saith, behold the la@@ mb of god !
and the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed jesus .
then jesus turned, and saw them follo@@ w@@ ing, and saith unto them, what seek ye ? they said unto him, rabbi, where dwel@@ lest thou ?
he saith unto them, come and see . they came and saw where he dwel@@ t, and abode with him that day : for it was about the ten@@ th hour .
one of the two which heard john speak, and followed him, was and@@ re@@ w, simon peter 's brother .
he first findeth his own brother simon, and saith unto him, we have found the mes@@ si@@ as, which is, being interpre@@ ted, the christ .
and he brought him to jesus . and when jesus beheld him, he said, thou art simon the son of jon@@ a : thou shalt be called ce@@ pha@@ s, which is by interpre@@ tation, a stone .
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee, and findeth philip, and saith unto him, follow me .
now philip was of bethsai@@ da@@ , the city of andrew and peter .
philip findeth nathana@@ e@@ l, and saith unto him, we have found him, of whom moses in the law, and the prophets, did wri@@ te, jesus of nazareth, the son of joseph .
and nathana@@ el said unto him, can there any good thing come out of nazareth ? philip saith unto him, come and see .
jesus saw nathana@@ el coming to him, and saith of him, behold an israe@@ li@@ te inde@@ ed, in whom is no gui@@ le !
nathana@@ el saith unto him, whence knowest thou me ? jesus answered and said unto him, before that philip called thee, when thou wa@@ st under the fig tree, i saw thee .
nathana@@ el answered and saith unto him, rabbi, thou art the son of god ; thou art the king of israel .
jesus answered and said unto him, because i said unto thee, i saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
and he saith unto him, verily, verily, i say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven op@@ en, and the angels of god as@@ cen@@ ding and descen@@ ding upon the son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in can@@ a of galilee ; and the mother of jesus was there :
and both jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage .
and when they w@@ an@@ ted win@@ e, the mother of jesus saith unto him, they have no wine .
jesus saith unto her, woman, what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
his mother saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do it .
and there were set there six wa@@ ter@@ po@@ ts of st@@ one, after the manner of the puri@@ fying of the jews, con@@ tain@@ ing two or three fir@@ kin@@ s a@@ piece .
jesus saith unto them, fi@@ ll the wa@@ ter@@ po@@ ts with water . and they filled them up to the bri@@ m .
and he saith unto them, draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast . and they bare it .
when the ruler of the feast had ta@@ sted the water that was made win@@ e, and knew not whence it was : the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
and saith unto him, every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drun@@ k, then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
this beginning of miracles did jesus in can@@ a of galilee, and mani@@ fes@@ ted forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
after this he went down to capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
and the jews ' passover was at hand, and jesus went up to jerusalem .
and found in the temple those that sold o@@ x@@ en and sheep and do@@ ves, and the chan@@ g@@ ers of money sitting :
and when he had made a scourge of small cor@@ ds, he d@@ ro@@ ve them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the o@@ x@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ g@@ ers ' mone@@ y, and over@@ threw the ta@@ b@@ les ;
and said unto them that sold do@@ ves, take these things hence ; make not my father 's house an house of mer@@ chan@@ di@@ se .
and his disciples remembered that it was written, the ze@@ al of thine house hath eaten me up .
then answered the jews and said unto him, what sign she@@ west thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things ?
jesus answered and said unto them, destroy this temple, and in three days i will raise it up .
then said the jews, forty and six years was this temple in build@@ ing, and wilt thou rea@@ r it up in three days ?
but he spake of the temple of his body .
when therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scriptu@@ re, and the word which jesus had said .
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did .
but jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men ,
and nee@@ ded not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
there was a man of the pharisees, named nico@@ de@@ mu@@ s, a ruler of the jews :
the same came to jesus by night, and said unto him, rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from god : for no man can do these miracles that thou do@@ est, except god be with him .
jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, i say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of god .
nico@@ dem@@ us saith unto him, how can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's wo@@ mb, and be born ?
jesus answered, verily, verily, i say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .
marvel not that i said unto thee, ye must be born again .
the wind b@@ lo@@ weth where it li@@ ste@@ th, and thou hea@@ rest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the spirit .
nico@@ dem@@ us answered and said unto him, how can these things be ?
jesus answered and said unto him, art thou a master of israel, and knowest not these things ?
verily, verily, i say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
if i have told you earth@@ ly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if i tell you of heavenly things ?
and no man hath as@@ cen@@ ded up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven .
and as moses lifted up the ser@@ p@@ ent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up :
that whosoever believeth in him should not per@@ ish, but have eternal life .
for god so loved the world, that he gave his only be@@ gotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not per@@ ish, but have everlasting life .
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
he that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned al@@ ready, because he hath not believed in the name of the only be@@ gotten son of god .
and this is the condem@@ nation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil .
for every one that doeth evil ha@@ teth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be repro@@ ved .
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made mani@@ fes@@ t, that they are wrought in god .
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea ; and there he tarried with them, and baptized .
and john also was baptiz@@ ing in a@@ en@@ on near to sa@@ li@@ m, because there was much water there : and they came, and were baptized .
for john was not yet cast into prison .
then there arose a question between some of john 's disciples and the jews about puri@@ fying .
and they came unto john, and said unto him, rabbi, he that was with thee beyond jordan, to whom thou ba@@ rest witness, behold, the same baptiz@@ eth, and all men come to him .
john answered and said, a man can receive no@@ thing, except it be given him from heaven .
ye yourselves bear me witness, that i said, i am not the christ, but that i am sent before him .
he that hath the bri@@ de is the bridegroom : but the fri@@ end of the brideg@@ roo@@ m, which stan@@ deth and heareth him, rejoi@@ ce@@ th greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he must in@@ crea@@ se, but i must dec@@ rea@@ se .
he that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earth@@ ly, and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
and what he hath seen and heard, that he testi@@ fi@@ eth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his se@@ al that god is true .
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god : for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him .
the father loveth the son, and hath given all things into his hand .
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the son shall not see life ; but the wra@@ th of god abi@@ deth on him .
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john ,

he left judaea, and departed again into galilee .
and he must needs go through samaria .
then cometh he to a city of samaria, which is called sy@@ cha@@ r, near to the par@@ ce@@ l of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph .
now jacob 's well was there . jesus therefore, being we@@ ari@@ ed with his journey, sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water : jesus saith unto her, give me to drink .

then saith the woman of samaria unto him, how is it that thou, being a jew@@ , as@@ kest drink of me, which am a woman of samaria ? for the jews have no de@@ al@@ ings with the samarit@@ ans .
jesus answered and said unto her, if thou kne@@ west the gift of god, and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water .
the woman saith unto him, sir, thou hast nothing to draw wi@@ th, and the well is de@@ ep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
art thou greater than our father jaco@@ b, which gave us the well, and d@@ ran@@ k thereof himself, and his children, and his ca@@ ttle ?
jesus answered and said unto her, whosoever drin@@ keth of this water shall thirst again :
but whosoever drin@@ keth of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water sp@@ r@@ ing@@ ing up into everlasting life .
the woman saith unto him, sir, give me this water, that i thirst not, neither come hither to draw .
jesus saith unto her, go, call thy husb@@ and, and come hither .
the woman answered and said, i have no husband . jesus said unto her, thou hast well said, i have no husband :
for thou hast had five husb@@ an@@ ds ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that sai@@ dst thou truly .
the woman saith unto him, sir, i perceive that thou art a prophet .
our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say, that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
jesus saith unto her, woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at jerusalem, worship the father .
ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the jews .
but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshi@@ p@@ pers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth : for the father seeketh such to worship him .
god is a spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
the woman saith unto him, i know that mes@@ sias cometh, which is called christ : when he is come, he will tell us all things .
jesus saith unto her, i that speak unto thee am he .
and upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said, what see@@ kest thou ? or, why tal@@ kest thou with her ?
the woman then left her wa@@ ter@@ po@@ t, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men ,
come, see a man, which told me all things that ever i did : is not this the christ ?
then they went out of the city, and came unto him .
in the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, master, eat .
but he said unto them, i have meat to eat that ye know not of .
therefore said the disciples one to another, hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
jesus saith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to fin@@ ish his work .
say not ye, there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest ? behold, i say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fie@@ l@@ ds ; for they are white already to harvest .
and he that rea@@ peth receiveth wa@@ ges, and ga@@ there@@ th fruit unto life eternal : that both he that so@@ weth and he that rea@@ peth may rejoice together .
and here@@ in is that saying true, one so@@ we@@ th, and another rea@@ peth .
i sent you to rea@@ p that where@@ on ye bes@@ to@@ wed no lab@@ our : other men labou@@ red, and ye are entered into their lab@@ ours .
and many of the samarit@@ ans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testi@@ fied, he told me all that ever i did .
so when the samarit@@ ans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
and many more believed because of his own word ;
and said unto the woman, now we believe, not because of thy saying : for we have heard him our@@ sel@@ ves, and know that this is indeed the christ, the sa@@ vi@@ our of the world .
now after two days he departed thence, and went into galilee .
for jesus himself testi@@ fied, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
then when he was come into galilee, the galilae@@ ans received him, having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
so jesus came again into can@@ a of galilee, where he made the water wine . and there was a certain no@@ ble@@ man, whose son was sick at capernaum .
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son : for he was at the poin@@ t of death .
then said jesus unto him, except ye see signs and wond@@ ers, ye will not believe .
the no@@ ble@@ man saith unto him, sir, come down er@@ e my child die .
jesus saith unto him, go thy way ; thy son li@@ veth . and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way .
and as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, thy son li@@ veth .
then en@@ quired he of them the hour when he began to am@@ end . and they said unto him, y@@ es@@ ter@@ day at the se@@ ven@@ th hour the fever left him .
so the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which jesus said unto him, thy son li@@ veth : and himself believed, and his whole house .
this is again the second miracle that jesus did, when he was come out of judaea into galilee .
after this there was a feast of the jews ; and jesus went up to jerusalem .
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep marke@@ t a po@@ o@@ l, which is called in the hebre@@ w tongue be@@ thes@@ da@@ , having five por@@ ches .
in these lay a great multitude of im@@ po@@ t@@ ent fol@@ k, of blind, ha@@ lt, wi@@ there@@ d, wai@@ ting for the mo@@ ving of the water .
for an angel went down at a certain season into the po@@ o@@ l, and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the trou@@ bl@@ ing of the water ste@@ pped in was made whole of whatsoever dise@@ ase he had .
and a certain man was there, which had an infirmi@@ ty thirty and ei@@ ght years .
when jesus saw him li@@ e, and knew that he had been now a long time in that ca@@ se, he saith unto him, wilt thou be made whole ?
the im@@ po@@ t@@ ent man answered him, sir, i have no man, when the water is troub@@ led, to put me into the po@@ ol : but while i am coming, another ste@@ p@@ peth down before me .
jesus saith unto him, rise, take up thy bed, and walk .
and immediately the man was made who@@ le, and took up his bed, and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
the jews therefore said unto him that was cu@@ red, it is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
he answered them, he that made me who@@ le, the same said unto me, take up thy bed, and walk .
then asked they him, what man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed, and walk ?
and he that was healed wist not who it was : for jesus had con@@ ve@@ yed himself away, a multitude being in that place .
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, behold, thou art made whole : sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee .
the man departed, and told the jews that it was jesus, which had made him whole .
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
but jesus answered them, my father wor@@ keth hi@@ ther@@ to@@ , and i work .
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabba@@ th, but said also that god was his father, ma@@ king himself e@@ qu@@ al with god .
then answered jesus and said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, the son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the father do : for what things soever he do@@ eth, these also doeth the son likewise .
for the father loveth the son, and she@@ weth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than the@@ se, that ye may marvel .
for as the father rai@@ seth up the dead, and quick@@ en@@ eth them ; even so the son quick@@ en@@ eth whom he will .
for the father jud@@ ge@@ th no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the son :
that all men should honour the son, even as they honour the father . he that honou@@ reth not the son honou@@ reth not the father which hath sent him .
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condem@@ nation ; but is passed from death unto life .
verily, verily, i say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god : and they that hear shall live .
for as the father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the son to have life in himself ;
and hath given him authority to ex@@ e@@ cu@@ te judgment also, because he is the son of man .
marvel not at this : for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the gra@@ ves shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of dam@@ nation .
i can of mine own sel@@ f do nothing : as i hear, i judge : and my judgment is just ; because i seek not mine own will, but the will of the father which hath sent me .
if i bear witness of myself, my witness is not true .
there is another that bea@@ reth witness of me ; and i know that the witness which he witnes@@ seth of me is true .
ye sent unto john, and he bare witness unto the truth .
but i receive not testimony from man : but these things i say, that ye might be saved .
he was a bur@@ ning and a shi@@ ning light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
but i have greater witness than that of john : for the works which the father hath given me to fin@@ ish, the same works that i do, bear witness of me, that the father hath sent me .
and the father himself, which hath sent me, hath bor@@ ne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his sha@@ pe .
and ye have not his word abi@@ ding in you : for whom he hath sen@@ t, him ye believe not .
se@@ ar@@ ch the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
and ye will not come to me, that ye might have life .
i receive not honour from men .
but i know you, that ye have not the love of god in you .
i am come in my father 's name, and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive .
how can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from god only ?
do not think that i will accuse you to the father : there is one that accu@@ seth you, even moses, in whom ye tru@@ st .
for had ye believed moses, ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of me .
but if ye believe not his wri@@ t@@ ings, how shall ye believe my words ?
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee, which is the sea of ti@@ ber@@ i@@ as .
and a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were dise@@ ased .
and jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples .
and the passover, a feast of the jews, was nigh .
when jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto philip, whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat ?
and this he said to pro@@ ve him : for he himself knew what he would do .
philip answered him, two hundred penn@@ y@@ wor@@ th of bread is not suf@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent for them, that every one of them may take a little .
one of his disciples, and@@ re@@ w, simon peter 's brother, saith unto him ,
there is a la@@ d here, which hath five bar@@ le@@ y loaves, and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
and jesus said, make the men sit down . now there was much gra@@ ss in the place . so the men sat down, in number about five thousand .
and jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks, he di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
when they were fi@@ lled, he said unto his disciples, gather up the frag@@ ments that rema@@ in, that nothing be lost .
therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the frag@@ ments of the five bar@@ le@@ y loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men, when they had seen the miracle that jesus did, said, this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by for@@ ce, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
and when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea ,
and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward capernaum . and it was now dar@@ k, and jesus was not come to them .
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that ble@@ w .
so when they had ro@@ wed about five and tw@@ en@@ ty or thirty fur@@ lon@@ g@@ s, they see jesus walking on the sea, and dra@@ wing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
but he saith unto them, it is i ; be not afraid .
then they wil@@ l@@ ing@@ ly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
the day follo@@ w@@ ing, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other bo@@ at there, save that one where@@ into his disciples were ente@@ red, and that jesus went not with his disciples into the bo@@ at, but that his disciples were gone away alone ;

when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shi@@ pp@@ ing, and came to capernaum, seeking for jesus .
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, rabbi, when ca@@ m@@ est thou hither ?
jesus answered them and said, verily, verily, i say unto you, ye seek me, not because ye saw the mirac@@ les, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled .
lab@@ our not for the meat which per@@ i@@ she@@ th, but for that meat which en@@ du@@ reth unto everlasting life, which the son of man shall give unto you : for him hath god the father se@@ aled .
then said they unto him, what shall we do, that we might work the works of god ?
jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of god, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
they said therefore unto him, what sign she@@ west thou then, that we may see, and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
our fathers did eat man@@ na in the desert ; as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat .
then jesus said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world .
then said they unto him, lord, ever@@ more give us this bread .
and jesus said unto them, i am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hun@@ ger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
but i said unto you, that ye also have seen me, and believe not .
all that the father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out .
for i came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me .
and this is the father 's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me i should lose no@@ thing, but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life : and i will raise him up at the last day .
the jews then murmured at him, because he said, i am the bread which came down from heaven .
and they said, is not this jesus, the son of joseph, whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith, i came down from heaven ?
jesus therefore answered and said unto them, murmu@@ r not among yourselves .
no man can come to me, except the father which hath sent me draw him : and i will raise him up at the last day .
it is written in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of god . every man therefore that hath heard, and hath lear@@ ned of the father, cometh unto me .
not that any man hath seen the father, save he which is of god, he hath seen the father .
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
i am that bread of life .
your fathers did eat man@@ na in the wilderness, and are dead .
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die .
i am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever : and the bread that i will give is my flesh, which i will give for the life of the world .
the jews therefore st@@ ro@@ ve among themselves, saying, how can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
then jesus said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you .
whoso eateth my flesh, and drin@@ keth my blood, hath eternal life ; and i will raise him up at the last day .
for my flesh is meat inde@@ ed, and my blood is drink indeed .
he that eateth my flesh, and drin@@ keth my blood, dwel@@ leth in me, and i in him .
as the living father hath sent me, and i live by the father : so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me .
this is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat man@@ na, and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
these things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in capernaum .
many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, this is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, doth this offend you ?
what and if ye shall see the son of man as@@ c@@ end up where he was before ?
it is the spirit that quick@@ en@@ eth ; the flesh profi@@ teth nothing : the words that i speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him .
and he said, therefore said i unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my father .
from that time many of his disciples went ba@@ ck, and walked no more with him .
then said jesus unto the twelve, will ye also go away ?
then simon peter answered him, lord, to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ, the son of the living god .
jesus answered them, have not i chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil ?
he spake of judas iscario@@ t the son of simon : for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve .
after these things jesus walked in galilee : for he would not walk in jew@@ ry, because the jews sought to kill him .
now the jew 's feast of tabernac@@ les was at hand .
his brethren therefore said unto him, depart hen@@ ce, and go into judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secre@@ t, and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things, shew thyself to the world .
for neither did his brethren believe in him .
then jesus said unto them, my time is not yet come : but your time is al@@ way ready .
the world cannot hate you ; but me it ha@@ te@@ th, because i testify of it, that the works thereof are evil .
go ye up unto this feast : i go not up yet unto this feast : for my time is not yet full come .
when he had said these words unto them, he abode still in galilee .
but when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the fea@@ st, not open@@ ly, but as it were in secret .
then the jews sought him at the fea@@ st, and said, where is he ?
and there was much mur@@ mur@@ ing among the people concerning him : for some said, he is a good man : others said, nay ; but he decei@@ veth the people .
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews .
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple, and taught .
and the jews marvelled, saying, how knoweth this man le@@ tter@@ s, having never lear@@ ned ?
jesus answered them, and said, my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me .
if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctr@@ in@@ e, whether it be of god, or whether i speak of myself .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no un@@ righteousness is in him .
did not moses give you the law, and yet none of you kee@@ peth the law ? why go ye about to kill me ?
the people answered and said, thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
jesus answered and said unto them, i have done one wor@@ k, and ye all marvel .
moses therefore gave unto you circumci@@ sion ; and ye on the sabbath day circumci@@ se a man .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumci@@ sion, that the law of moses should not be broken ; are ye an@@ g@@ ry at me, because i have made a man every whi@@ t whole on the sabbath day ?
judge not according to the appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ce, but judge righteous judgment .
then said some of them of jerusalem, is not this he, whom they seek to kill ?
but, lo, he speaketh bold@@ ly, and they say nothing unto him . do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ ?
howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is .
then cried jesus in the temple as he ta@@ u@@ ght, saying, ye both know me, and ye know whence i am : and i am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not .
but i know him : for i am from him, and he hath sent me .
then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come .
and many of the people believed on him, and said, when christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
then said jesus unto them, yet a little while am i with you, and then i go unto him that sent me .
ye shall seek me, and shall not find me : and where i am, thither ye cannot come .
then said the jews among themselves, whither will he go, that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the disp@@ er@@ sed among the gentiles, and teach the gentiles ?
what manner of saying is this that he said, ye shall seek me, and shall not find me : and where i am, thither ye cannot come ?
in the last day, that great day of the fea@@ st, jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thir@@ st, let him come unto me, and drink .
he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his be@@ l@@ ly shall flo@@ w ri@@ vers of living water .

many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, of a truth this is the prophet .
others said, this is the christ . but some said, shall christ come out of galilee ?
hath not the scripture said, that christ cometh of the seed of david, and out of the town of bethlehe@@ m, where david was ?
so there was a divi@@ sion among the people because of him .
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees ; and they said unto them, why have ye not brought him ?
the officers answered, never man spake like this man .
then answered them the pharisees, are ye also decei@@ ved ?
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him ?
but this people who knoweth not the law are cur@@ sed .
nico@@ dem@@ us saith unto them, 
doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth ?
they answered and said unto him, art thou also of galilee ? se@@ ar@@ ch, and look : for out of galilee ari@@ seth no prophet .
and every man went unto his own house .
jesus went unto the mount of olives .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down, and taught them .
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
they say unto him, master, this woman was taken in adulter@@ y, in the very ac@@ t .
now moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
this they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him . but jesus sto@@ op@@ ed down, and with his fing@@ er wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not .
so when they continued as@@ king him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her .
and again he sto@@ op@@ ed down, and wrote on the ground .
and they which heard it, being con@@ vi@@ cted by their own cons@@ ci@@ en@@ ce, went out one by one, beginning at the eld@@ est, even unto the last : and jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst .
when jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, woman, where are those thine accu@@ sers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
she said, no man, lord . and jesus said unto her, neither do i condemn thee : go, and sin no more .
then spake jesus again unto them, saying, i am the light of the world : he that follo@@ weth me shall not walk in dark@@ ness, but shall have the light of life .
the pharisees therefore said unto him, thou bea@@ rest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
jesus answered and said unto them, though i bear record of myself, yet my record is true : for i know whence i came, and whither i go ; but ye cannot tell whence i come, and whither i go .
ye judge after the flesh ; i judge no man .
and yet if i judge, my judgment is true : for i am not alone, but i and the father that sent me .
it is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true .
i am one that bear witness of myself, and the father that sent me bea@@ reth witness of me .
then said they unto him, where is thy father ? jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my father : if ye had known me, ye should have known my father also .
these words spake jesus in the treasu@@ ry, as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
then said jesus again unto them, i go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins : whither i go, ye cannot come .
then said the jews, will he kill himself ? because he saith, whither i go, ye cannot come .
and he said unto them, ye are from b@@ ene@@ a@@ th ; i am from above : ye are of this world ; i am not of this world .
i said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that i am he, ye shall die in your sins .
then said they unto him, who art thou ? and jesus saith unto them, even the same that i said unto you from the beginning .
i have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him .
they understood not that he spake to them of the father .
then said jesus unto them, when ye have lifted up the son of man, then shall ye know that i am he, and that i do nothing of myself ; but as my father hath taught me, i speak these things .
and he that sent me is with me : the father hath not left me alone ; for i do always those things that please him .
as he spake these words, many believed on him .
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him, if ye continu@@ e in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed ;
and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free .
they answered him, we be abraham 's seed, and were never in bon@@ da@@ ge to any man : how sayest thou, ye shall be made free ?
jesus answered them, verily, verily, i say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
and the servant abi@@ deth not in the house for ever : but the son abi@@ deth ever .
if the son therefore shall make you fre@@ e, ye shall be free indeed .
i know that ye are abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you .
i speak that which i have seen with my father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
they answered and said unto him, abraham is our father . jesus saith unto them, if ye were abraham 's children, ye would do the works of abraham .
but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which i have heard of god : this did not abraham .
ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him, we be not born of forni@@ cation ; we have one father, even god .
jesus said unto them, if god were your father, ye would love me : for i proce@@ e@@ ded forth and came from god ; neither came i of myself, but he sent me .
why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
ye are of your father the devil, and the lu@@ sts of your father ye will do . he was a murde@@ re@@ r from the begin@@ ning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him . when he speaketh a li@@ e, he speaketh of his own : for he is a li@@ ar, and the father of it .
and because i tell you the truth, ye believe me not .
which of you con@@ vin@@ ce@@ th me of sin ? and if i say the truth, why do ye not believe me ?
he that is of god heareth god 's words : ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of god .
then answered the jews, and said unto him, say we not well that thou art a samarit@@ an, and hast a devil ?
jesus answered, i have not a devil ; but i honour my father, and ye do dis@@ honour me .
and i seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and jud@@ ge@@ th .
verily, verily, i say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death .
then said the jews unto him, now we know that thou hast a devil . abraham is dead, and the prophets ; and thou say@@ est, if a man keep my saying, he shall never ta@@ ste of death .
art thou greater than our father abraham, which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom ma@@ kest thou thyself ?
jesus answered, if i honour myself, my honour is nothing : it is my father that honou@@ reth me ; of whom ye say, that he is your god :
yet ye have not known him ; but i know him : and if i should say, i know him not, i shall be a li@@ ar like unto you : but i know him, and keep his saying .
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it, and was glad .
then said the jews unto him, thou art not yet fif@@ ty years old, and hast thou seen abraham ?
jesus said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, before abraham was, i am .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by .
and as jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his bir@@ th .
and his disciples asked him, saying, master, who did sin@@ , this man, or his parents, that he was born blind ?
jesus answered, neither hath this man sin@@ ned, nor his parents : but that the works of god should be made manifest in him .
i must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day : the night cometh, when no man can work .
as long as i am in the world, i am the light of the world .
when he had thus spoken, he sp@@ at on the ground, and made c@@ lay of the spi@@ tt@@ le, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the c@@ lay ,
and said unto him, go, wash in the po@@ ol of si@@ loa@@ m, he went his way therefore, and washe@@ d, and came seeing .
the neighb@@ ours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, is not this he that sat and beg@@ ged ?
some said, this is he : others said, he is like him : but he said, i am he .
therefore said they unto him, how were thine eyes opened ?
he answered and said, a man that is called jesus made c@@ la@@ y, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, go to the po@@ ol of si@@ loa@@ m, and wash : and i went and washe@@ d, and i received sight .
then said they unto him, where is he ? he said, i know not .
they brought to the pharisees him that af@@ o@@ re@@ time was blind .
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the c@@ la@@ y, and opened his eyes .
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them, he put c@@ lay upon mine eyes, and i washe@@ d, and do see .
therefore said some of the pharisees, this man is not of god, because he kee@@ peth not the sabbath day . others said, how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? and there was a divi@@ sion among them .
they say unto the blind man again, what sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes ? he said, he is a prophet .
but the jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
and they asked them, saying, is this your son, who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
his parents answered them and said, we know that this is our son, and that he was born blind :
but by what means he now see@@ th, we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
these words spake his parents, because they feared the jews : for the jews had agreed al@@ ready, that if any man did confess that he was christ, he should be put out of the synagogue .
therefore said his parents, he is of age ; ask him .
then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, give god the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
he answered and said, whether he be a sinner or no, i know not : one thing i know, that, where@@ as i was blind, now i see .
then said they to him again, what did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
he answered them, i have told you al@@ ready, and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
then they re@@ vi@@ led him, and said, thou art his disciple ; but we are moses ' disciples .
we know that god spake unto moses : as for this fello@@ w, we know not from whence he is .
the man answered and said unto them, why here@@ in is a marve@@ ll@@ ous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that god heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshi@@ p@@ per of god, and doeth his will, him he heareth .
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
if this man were not of god, he could do nothing .
they answered and said unto him, thou wa@@ st al@@ together born in sins, and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out .
jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him, he said unto him, dost thou believe on the son of god ?
he answered and said, who is he, lord, that i might believe on him ?
and jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that tal@@ keth with thee .
and he said, lord, i believe . and he worshipped him .
and jesus said, for judgment i am come into this world, that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, are we blind also ?
jesus said unto them, if ye were blind, ye should have no sin : but now ye say, we see ; therefore your sin rema@@ in@@ eth .
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the she@@ ep@@ fold, but c@@ li@@ mbe@@ th up some other way, the same is a thief and a ro@@ b@@ be@@ r .
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
to him the por@@ ter open@@ eth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name, and lea@@ deth them out .
and when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
and a str@@ anger will they not follo@@ w, but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
this parable spake jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
then said jesus unto them again, verily, verily, i say unto you, i am the door of the sheep .
all that ever came before me are thieves and ro@@ b@@ b@@ ers : but the sheep did not hear them .
i am the door : by me if any man enter in, he shall be sa@@ ved, and shall go in and out, and find pa@@ stu@@ re .
the thief cometh not, but for to ste@@ al, and to ki@@ ll, and to destroy : i am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abund@@ an@@ tly .
i am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
but he that is an hi@@ re@@ ling, and not the shepher@@ d, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wol@@ f coming, and lea@@ veth the sheep, and fle@@ eth : and the wol@@ f ca@@ t@@ che@@ th them, and scatte@@ reth the sheep .
the hi@@ re@@ ling fle@@ eth, because he is an hi@@ re@@ ling, and ca@@ reth not for the sheep .
i am the good shepher@@ d, and know my sheep, and am known of mine .
as the father knoweth me, even so know i the father : and i lay down my life for the sheep .
and other sheep i ha@@ ve, which are not of this fold : them also i must br@@ ing, and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd .
therefore doth my father love me, because i lay down my life, that i might take it again .
no man taketh it from me, but i lay it down of myself . i have power to lay it down, and i have power to take it again . this commandment have i received of my father .
there was a divi@@ sion therefore again among the jews for these sayings .
and many of them said, he hath a devil, and is ma@@ d ; why hear ye him ?
others said, these are not the words of him that hath a devil . can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
and it was at jerusalem the feast of the de@@ di@@ ca@@ tion, and it was win@@ ter .
and jesus walked in the temple in solomon 's por@@ ch .
then came the jews round about him, and said unto him, how long dost thou make us to doub@@ t ? if thou be the christ, tell us pla@@ in@@ ly .
jesus answered them, i told you, and ye believed not : the works that i do in my father 's name, they bear witness of me .
but ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as i said unto you .
my sheep hear my voice, and i know them, and they follow me :
and i give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never per@@ ish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
my father, which gave them me, is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my father 's hand .
i and my father are one .
then the jews took up stones again to stone him .
jesus answered them, many good works have i shewed you from my father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
the jews answered him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphe@@ my ; and because that thou, being a man, ma@@ kest thyself god .
jesus answered them, is it not written in your law, i said, ye are go@@ ds ?
if he called them go@@ ds, unto whom the word of god came, and the scripture cannot be broken ;
say ye of him, whom the father hath sancti@@ fied, and sent into the world, thou blasphe@@ m@@ est ; because i said, i am the son of god ?
if i do not the works of my father, believe me not .
but if i do, though ye believe not me, believe the works : that ye may know, and believe, that the father is in me, and i in him .
therefore they sought again to take him : but he es@@ cap@@ ed out of their hand ,
and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized ; and there he abode .
and many resor@@ ted unto him, and said, john did no miracle : but all things that john spake of this man were true .
and many believed on him there .
now a certain man was sick, named lazar@@ us, of bethany, the town of mary and her sister martha .

therefore his si@@ sters sent unto him, saying, lord, behold, he whom thou lo@@ vest is sick .
when jesus heard that, he said, this sick@@ ness is not unto death, but for the glory of god, that the son of god might be glorified there@@ by .
now jesus loved marth@@ a, and her si@@ ster, and lazarus .
when he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
then after that saith he to his disciples, let us go into judaea again .
his disciples say unto him, master, the jews of la@@ te sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
jesus answered, are there not twelve hou@@ rs in the day ? if any man walk in the day, he stu@@ mb@@ leth not, because he seeth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night, he stu@@ mb@@ le@@ th, because there is no light in him .
these things said he : and after that he saith unto them, our fri@@ end lazarus sle@@ e@@ peth ; but i go, that i may a@@ wa@@ ke him out of sleep .
then said his disciples, lord, if he sle@@ ep, he shall do well .
howbeit jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
then said jesus unto them pla@@ in@@ ly, lazarus is dead .
and i am glad for your sa@@ kes that i was not there, to the int@@ ent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
then said thomas, which is called di@@ d@@ y@@ mu@@ s, unto his fellow@@ disciples, let us also go, that we may die with him .
then when jesus came, he found that he had la@@ in in the gra@@ ve four days already .
now beth@@ any was nigh unto jerusalem, about fif@@ teen fur@@ lon@@ gs off :
and many of the jews came to martha and mary, to comfor@@ t them concerning their brother .
then marth@@ a, as soon as she heard that jesus was coming, went and met him : but mary sat still in the house .
then said martha unto jesus, lord, if thou ha@@ dst been here, my brother had not died .
but i know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of god, god will give it thee .
jesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise again .
martha saith unto him, i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
jesus said unto her, i am the resurre@@ ction, and the life : he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live :
and whosoever li@@ veth and believeth in me shall never die . believest thou this ?
she saith unto him, yea, lord : i believe that thou art the christ, the son of god, which should come into the world .
and when she had so said, she went her way, and called mary her sister secre@@ tly, saying, the master is come, and calleth for thee .
as soon as she heard that, she arose quick@@ ly, and came unto him .
now jesus was not yet come into the tow@@ n, but was in that place where martha met him .
the jews then which were with her in the house, and comfor@@ ted her, when they saw mary, that she rose up ha@@ sti@@ ly and went out, followed her, saying, she goeth unto the gra@@ ve to weep there .
then when mary was come where jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, lord, if thou ha@@ dst been here, my brother had not died .
when jesus therefore saw her weep@@ ing, and the jews also weeping which came with her, he g@@ ro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit, and was troubled .
and said, where have ye laid him ? they said unto him, lord, come and see .
jesus wept .
then said the jews, behold how he loved him !
and some of them said, could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have ca@@ used that even this man should not have died ?
jesus therefore again g@@ ro@@ an@@ ing in himself cometh to the gra@@ ve . it was a ca@@ ve, and a stone lay upon it .
jesus said, take ye away the stone . marth@@ a, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, lord, by this time he st@@ in@@ keth : for he hath been dead four days .
jesus saith unto her, said i not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, father, i thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and i knew that thou hea@@ rest me always : but because of the people which stand by i said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
and when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, lazar@@ us, come forth .
and he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with gra@@ ve@@ clothes : and his face was bound about with a na@@ p@@ k@@ in . jesus saith unto them, loose him, and let him go .
then many of the jews which came to mary, and had seen the things which jesus did, believed on him .
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees, and told them what things jesus had done .
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council, and said, what do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him : and the roman@@ s shall come and take away both our place and nation .
and one of them, named caiapha@@ s, being the high priest that same year@@ , said unto them, ye know nothing at all ,
nor consi@@ der that it is expe@@ di@@ ent for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not .
and this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year@@ , he prophesi@@ ed that jesus should die for that nation ;
and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad .
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called ep@@ h@@ rai@@ m, and there continued with his disciples .
and the jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover, to puri@@ fy themselves .
then sought they for jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, what think ye, that he will not come to the feast ?
now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a command@@ ment, that, if any man knew where he we@@ re, he should shew it, that they might take him .
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany, where lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead .
there they made him a sup@@ per ; and martha served : but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took mary a p@@ ound of ointment of spi@@ k@@ en@@ ard, very co@@ st@@ ly, and anointed the feet of jesus, and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir : and the house was filled with the o@@ d@@ our of the ointment .
then saith one of his disciples, judas iscariot, simon 's son, which should betray him ,
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pen@@ ce, and given to the poor ?
this he said, not that he ca@@ red for the poor ; but because he was a thie@@ f, and had the ba@@ g, and bare what was put therein .
then said jesus, let her alone : against the day of my bur@@ ying hath she kept this .
for the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for jesus ' sake only, but that they might see lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead .
but the chief priests cons@@ ul@@ ted that they might put lazarus also to death ;
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away, and believed on jesus .
on the next day much people that were come to the fea@@ st, when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem ,
took branches of pal@@ m tre@@ es, and went forth to meet him, and cried, hosanna : blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord .
and jesus, when he had found a young as@@ s, sat thereon ; as it is written ,
fear not, daughter of sion : behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an as@@ s 's colt .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when jesus was glori@@ fied, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him .
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his gra@@ ve, and raised him from the dead, bare record .
for this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
the pharisees therefore said among themselves, perceive ye how ye pre@@ va@@ il nothing ? behold, the world is gone after him .
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
the same came therefore to philip, which was of bethsai@@ da of galilee, and desired him, saying, sir, we would see jesus .
philip cometh and te@@ l@@ leth andrew : and again andrew and philip tell jesus .
and jesus answered them, saying, the hour is come, that the son of man should be glorified .
verily, verily, i say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abi@@ deth alone : but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit .
he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that ha@@ teth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
if any man serve me, let him follow me ; and where i am, there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me, him will my father honour .
now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father, save me from this hour : but for this cause came i unto this hour .
father, glorify thy name . then came there a voice from heaven, saying, i have both glorified it, and will glorify it again .
the people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it th@@ un@@ dered : others said, an angel spake to him .
jesus answered and said, this voice came not because of me, but for your sa@@ kes .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
and i, if i be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me .
this he said, signi@@ fying what death he should die .
the people answered him, we have heard out of the law that christ abi@@ deth for ever : and how sayest thou, the son of man must be lifted up ? who is this son of man ?
then jesus said unto them, yet a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you : for he that wal@@ keth in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
while ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light . these things spake jesus, and departed, and did hi@@ de himself from them .
but though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him :
that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, lord, who hath believed our re@@ port ? and to whom hath the ar@@ m of the lord been revealed ?
therefore they could not believe, because that esaias said again ,
he hath blin@@ ded their eyes, and har@@ d@@ ened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and i should heal them .
these things said esai@@ as, when he saw his glory, and spake of him .
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god .
jesus cried and said, he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me .
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
i am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
and if any man hear my words, and believe not, i judge him not : for i came not to judge the world, but to save the world .
he that reje@@ c@@ teth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that jud@@ ge@@ th him : the word that i have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day .
for i have not spoken of myself ; but the father which sent me, he gave me a command@@ ment, what i should say, and what i should speak .
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever i speak therefore, even as the father said unto me, so i speak .
now before the feast of the passover, when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end .
and sup@@ per being en@@ ded, the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot, simon 's son, to betray him ;
jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from god, and went to god ;
he ri@@ seth from sup@@ per, and laid aside his garments ; and took a to@@ we@@ l, and gir@@ ded himself .
after that he p@@ ou@@ reth water into a b@@ as@@ on, and began to wash the disciples ' feet, and to wi@@ pe them with the to@@ we@@ l wherewith he was gir@@ ded .
then cometh he to simon peter : and peter saith unto him, lord, dost thou wash my feet ?
jesus answered and said unto him, what i do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
peter saith unto him, thou shalt never wash my feet . jesus answered him, if i wash thee not, thou hast no part with me .
simon peter saith unto him, lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head .
jesus saith to him, he that is washed nee@@ deth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whi@@ t : and ye are cle@@ an, but not all .
for he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he, ye are not all clean .
so after he had washed their feet, and had taken his gar@@ ments, and was set down again, he said unto them, know ye what i have done to you ?
ye call me master and lord : and ye say well ; for so i am .
if i then, your lord and master, have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet .
for i have given you an exa@@ m@@ ple, that ye should do as i have done to you .
verily, verily, i say unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
if ye know these things, ha@@ pp@@ y are ye if ye do them .
i speak not of you all : i know whom i have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled, he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his he@@ el against me .
now i tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that i am he .
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
when jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testi@@ fied, and said, verily, verily, i say unto you, that one of you shall betray me .
then the disciples looked one on another, doub@@ ting of whom he spake .
now there was le@@ an@@ ing on jesus ' bo@@ som one of his disciples, whom jesus loved .
simon peter therefore beck@@ oned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
he then lying on jesus ' brea@@ st saith unto him, lord, who is it ?
jesus answered, he it is, to whom i shall give a so@@ p, when i have di@@ pped it . and when he had di@@ pped the so@@ p, he gave it to judas iscariot, the son of simon .
and after the so@@ p satan entered into him . then said jesus unto him, that thou do@@ est, do quick@@ ly .
now no man at the table knew for what int@@ ent he spake this unto him .
for some of them thou@@ ght, because judas had the ba@@ g, that jesus had said unto him, buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or, that he should give something to the poor .
he then having received the so@@ p went immediately out : and it was night .
therefore, when he was gone out, jesus said, now is the son of man glori@@ fied, and god is glorified in him .
if god be glorified in him, god shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him .
little children, yet a little while i am with you . ye shall seek me : and as i said unto the jews, whither i go, ye cannot come ; so now i say to you .
a new commandment i give unto you, that ye love one another ; as i have loved you, that ye also love one another .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another .
simon peter said unto him, lord, whither goest thou ? jesus answered him, whither i go, thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me after@@ war@@ ds .
peter said unto him, lord, why cannot i follow thee now ? i will lay down my life for thy sake .
jesus answered him, wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily, verily, i say unto thee, the cock shall not cro@@ w, till thou hast denied me thrice .
let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in god, believe also in me .
in my father 's house are many man@@ sions : if it were not so, i would have told you . i go to prepare a place for you .
and if i go and prepare a place for you, i will come again, and receive you unto myself ; that where i am, there ye may be also .
and whither i go ye know, and the way ye know .
tho@@ m@@ as saith unto him, lord, we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
jesus saith unto him, i am the way, the truth, and the life : no man cometh unto the father, but by me .
if ye had known me, ye should have known my father also : and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him .
philip saith unto him, lord, shew us the father, and it suf@@ fi@@ ce@@ th us .
jesus saith unto him, have i been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the father ; and how sayest thou then, shew us the father ?
believest thou not that i am in the father, and the father in me ? the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself : but the father that dwel@@ leth in me, he doeth the works .
believe me that i am in the father, and the father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that i do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because i go unto my father .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will i do, that the father may be glorified in the son .
if ye shall ask any thing in my name, i will do it .
if ye love me, keep my commandments .
and i will pray the father, and he shall give you another comfor@@ ter, that he may abide with you for ever ;
even the spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot recei@@ ve, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwel@@ leth with you, and shall be in you .
i will not leave you comfor@@ t@@ less : i will come to you .
yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because i li@@ ve, ye shall live also .
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father, and ye in me, and i in you .
he that hath my command@@ ments, and kee@@ peth them, he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and i will love him, and will manifest myself to him .
judas saith unto him, not iscariot, lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world ?
jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me, he will keep my words : and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him .
he that loveth me not kee@@ peth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the father 's which sent me .
these things have i spoken unto you, being yet present with you .
but the comfor@@ ter, which is the holy ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your reme@@ m@@ bran@@ ce, whatsoever i have said unto you .
peace i leave with you, my peace i give unto you : not as the world gi@@ ve@@ th, give i unto you . let not your heart be troub@@ led, neither let it be afraid .
ye have heard how i said unto you, i go away, and come again unto you . if ye loved me, ye would rejoi@@ ce, because i said, i go unto the father : for my father is greater than i .
and now i have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe .
hereafter i will not tal@@ k much with you : for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me .
but that the world may know that i love the father ; and as the father gave me command@@ ment, even so i do . arise, let us go hence .
i am the true vin@@ e, and my father is the husband@@ man .
every bran@@ ch in me that bea@@ reth not fruit he taketh away : and every bran@@ ch that bea@@ reth fruit, he pur@@ ge@@ th it, that it may bring forth more fruit .
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you .
abide in me, and i in you . as the bran@@ ch cannot bear fruit of itsel@@ f, except it abide in the v@@ ine ; no more can ye, except ye abide in me .
i am the vin@@ e, ye are the branches : he that abi@@ deth in me, and i in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
if a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a bran@@ ch, and is withered ; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are bur@@ ned .
if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you .
here@@ in is my father glori@@ fied, that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
as the father hath loved me, so have i loved you : continu@@ e ye in my love .
if ye keep my command@@ ments, ye shall abide in my love ; even as i have kept my father 's command@@ ments, and abide in his love .
these things have i spoken unto you, that my joy might rema@@ in in you, and that your joy might be full .
this is my command@@ ment, that ye love one another, as i have loved you .
greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends .
ye are my frien@@ ds, if ye do whatsoever i command you .
henceforth i call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but i have called you friends ; for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you .
ye have not chosen me, but i have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should rema@@ in : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you .
these things i command you, that ye love one another .
if the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
if ye were of the world, the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world, but i have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world ha@@ teth you .
remember the word that i said unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying, they will keep you@@ rs also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake, because they know not him that sent me .
if i had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin : but now they have no clo@@ a@@ k for their sin .
he that ha@@ teth me ha@@ teth my father also .
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father .
but this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated me without a cause .
but when the comfor@@ ter is come, whom i will send unto you from the father, even the spirit of truth, which proce@@ e@@ deth from the father, he shall testify of me :
and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning .
these things have i spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended .
they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea, the time cometh, that whosoever ki@@ l@@ leth you will think that he doeth god ser@@ vi@@ ce .
and these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the father, nor me .
but these things have i told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that i told you of them . and these things i said not unto you at the begin@@ ning, because i was with you .
but now i go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you as@@ keth me, whither goest thou ?
but because i have said these things unto you, sor@@ row hath filled your heart .
nevertheless i tell you the truth ; it is expe@@ di@@ ent for you that i go away : for if i go not away, the comfor@@ ter will not come unto you ; but if i depar@@ t, i will send him unto you .
and when he is come, he will repro@@ ve the world of sin@@ , and of righteousness, and of judgment :
of sin@@ , because they believe not on me ;
of righteousness, because i go to my father, and ye see me no more ;
of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged .
i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now .
howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will gu@@ ide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
he shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you .
all things that the father hath are mine : therefore said i, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you .
a little while, and ye shall not see me : and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because i go to the father .
then said some of his disciples among themselves, what is this that he saith unto us, a little while, and ye shall not see me : and again, a little while, and ye shall see me : and, because i go to the father ?
they said therefore, what is this that he saith, a little while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
now jesus knew that they were desi@@ r@@ ous to ask him, and said unto them, do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said, a little while, and ye shall not see me : and again, a little while, and ye shall see me ?
verily, verily, i say unto you, that ye shall weep and la@@ ment, but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrow@@ ful, but your sor@@ row shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in tra@@ va@@ il hath sor@@ row, because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she reme@@ mbe@@ reth no more the an@@ gu@@ ish, for joy that a man is born into the world .
and ye now therefore have sor@@ row : but i will see you again, and your heart shall rejoi@@ ce, and your joy no man taketh from you .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily, verily, i say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name, he will give it you .
hi@@ ther@@ to have ye asked nothing in my name : as@@ k, and ye shall recei@@ ve, that your joy may be full .
these things have i spoken unto you in pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s : but the time cometh, when i shall no more speak unto you in pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s, but i shall shew you pla@@ in@@ ly of the father .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and i say not unto you, that i will pray the father for you :
for the father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that i came out from god .
i came forth from the father, and am come into the world : again, i leave the world, and go to the father .
his disciples said unto him, lo, now spea@@ kest thou pla@@ in@@ ly, and spea@@ kest no pro@@ ver@@ b .
now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and nee@@ dest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou ca@@ m@@ est forth from god .
jesus answered them, do ye now believe ?
behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scatte@@ red, every man to his ow@@ n, and shall leave me alone : and yet i am not alone, because the father is with me .
these things i have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribu@@ lation : but be of good che@@ er ; i have over@@ come the world .
these words spake jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, father, the hour is come ; glorify thy son, that thy son also may glorify thee :
as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
and this is life eter@@ n@@ al, that they might know thee the only true god, and jesus christ, whom thou hast sent .
i have glorified thee on the earth : i have fin@@ ished the work which thou gavest me to do .
and now, o father, glorify thou me with thine own sel@@ f with the glory which i had with thee before the world was .
i have mani@@ fes@@ ted thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they we@@ re, and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them, and have known sure@@ ly that i came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me .
i pray for them : i pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
and all mine are thin@@ e, and thine are mine ; and i am glorified in them .
and now i am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and i come to thee . holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are .
while i was with them in the world, i kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me i have ke@@ pt, and none of them is lo@@ st, but the son of per@@ dition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
and now come i to thee ; and these things i speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
i have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as i am not of the world .
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
they are not of the world, even as i am not of the world .
sancti@@ fy them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
as thou hast sent me into the world, even so have i also sent them into the world .
and for their sa@@ kes i sancti@@ fy myself, that they also might be sancti@@ fied through the truth .
neither pray i for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
that they all may be one ; as thou, father, art in me, and i in thee, that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them ; that they may be one, even as we are one :
i in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me .
father, i will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where i am ; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me : for thou lo@@ ve@@ dst me before the founda@@ tion of the world .
o righteous father, the world hath not known thee : but i have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me .
and i have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and i in them .
when jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the bro@@ ok ced@@ r@@ on, where was a gar@@ d@@ en, into the which he ente@@ red, and his disciples .
and judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place : for jesus of@@ t@@ times resor@@ ted thither with his disciples .
judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, cometh thither with lan@@ ter@@ ns and tor@@ ches and we@@ ap@@ ons .
jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, whom seek ye ?
they answered him, jesus of nazareth . jesus saith unto them, i am he . and judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them .
as soon then as he had said unto them, i am he, they went ba@@ ck@@ ward, and fell to the ground .
then asked he them again, whom seek ye ? and they said, jesus of nazareth .
jesus answered, i have told you that i am he : if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way :
that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, of them which thou gavest me have i lost none .
then simon peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest 's servant, and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was ma@@ l@@ ch@@ us .
then said jesus unto peter, put up thy sword into the s@@ hea@@ th : the cup which my father hath given me, shall i not drink it ?
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus, and bound him ,
and led him away to an@@ n@@ as first ; for he was father in law to caiapha@@ s, which was the high priest that same year .
now caiapha@@ s was he, which gave counsel to the jews, that it was expe@@ di@@ ent that one man should die for the people .
and simon peter followed jesus, and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with jesus into the pala@@ ce of the high priest .
but peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in peter .
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter, art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? he saith, i am not .
and the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of co@@ al@@ s ; for it was co@@ ld : and they war@@ med themselves : and peter stood with them, and war@@ med himself .
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine .
jesus answered him, i spake openly to the world ; i ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the jews always resor@@ t ; and in secret have i said nothing .
why as@@ kest thou me ? ask them which heard me, what i have said unto them : behold, they know what i said .
and when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by st@@ ru@@ ck jesus with the pal@@ m of his hand, saying, answe@@ rest thou the high priest so ?
jesus answered him, if i have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil : but if well, why smi@@ test thou me ?
now an@@ n@@ as had sent him bound unto caiapha@@ s the high priest .
and simon peter stood and war@@ med himself . they said therefore unto him, art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it, and said, i am not .
one of the servants of the high priest, being his kin@@ s@@ man whose ear peter cut off, saith, did not i see thee in the gar@@ den with him ?
peter then denied again : and immediately the cock cre@@ w .
then led they jesus from caiapha@@ s unto the ha@@ ll of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment ha@@ ll, lest they should be de@@ fi@@ led ; but that they might eat the passover .
pilate then went out unto them, and said, what accu@@ sa@@ tion bring ye against this man ?
they answered and said unto him, if he were not a ma@@ le@@ fa@@ ctor@@ , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
then said pilate unto them, take ye him, and judge him according to your law . the jews therefore said unto him, it is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signi@@ fying what death he should die .
then pilate entered into the judgment ha@@ ll again, and called jesus, and said unto him, art thou the king of the jews ?
jesus answered him, sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me ?
pilate answered, am i a jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fi@@ ght, that i should not be delivered to the jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
pilate therefore said unto him, art thou a king then ? jesus answered, thou sayest that i am a king . to this end was i bor@@ n, and for this cause came i into the world, that i should bear witness unto the truth . every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
pilate saith unto him, what is truth ? and when he had said this, he went out again unto the jews, and saith unto them, i find in him no fault at all .
but ye have a custo@@ m, that i should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
then cried they all again, saying, not this man, but barabbas . now barabbas was a ro@@ b@@ be@@ r .
then pilate therefore took jesus, and scour@@ ged him .
and the soldiers pla@@ tted a cro@@ wn of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a pur@@ p@@ le ro@@ be ,
and said, hai@@ l, king of the jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, behold, i bring him forth to you, that ye may know that i find no fault in him .
then came jesus forth, we@@ aring the cro@@ wn of thorns, and the pur@@ p@@ le ro@@ be . and pilate saith unto them, behold the man !
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify him . pilate saith unto them, take ye him, and crucify him : for i find no fault in him .
the jews answered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the son of god .
when pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid ;
and went again into the judgment ha@@ ll, and saith unto jesus, whence art thou ? but jesus gave him no answer .
then saith pilate unto him, spea@@ kest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee ?
jesus answered, thou c@@ ouldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
and from then@@ ce@@ forth pilate sought to release him : but the jews cried out, saying, if thou let this man go, thou art not caesar 's fri@@ end : whosoever ma@@ keth himself a king speaketh against caesar .
when pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pa@@ ve@@ ment, but in the hebre@@ w, ga@@ bba@@ th@@ a .
and it was the pre@@ par@@ ation of the passover, and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the jews, behold your king !
but they cried out, away with him, away with him, crucify him . pilate saith unto them, shall i crucify your king ? the chief priests answered, we have no king but caesar .
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . and they took jesus, and led him away .
and he be@@ aring his cross went forth into a place called the place of a sk@@ ul@@ l, which is called in the hebre@@ w go@@ l@@ go@@ th@@ a :
where they crucified him, and two other with him, on e@@ ither side one, and jesus in the midst .
and pilate wrote a ti@@ t@@ le, and put it on the cross . and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews .
this ti@@ t@@ le then read many of the jews : for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in hebre@@ w, and gree@@ k, and la@@ t@@ in .
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate, write not, the king of the jews ; but that he said, i am king of the jews .
pilate answered, what i have written i have written .
then the soldiers, when they had crucified jesus, took his gar@@ ments, and made four par@@ ts, to every soldi@@ er a part ; and also his co@@ at : now the co@@ at was without sea@@ m, wo@@ ven from the top throughout .
they said therefore among themselves, let us not ren@@ d it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, they parted my raiment among them, and for my ves@@ ture they did cast lots . these things therefore the soldiers did .
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother, and his mother 's si@@ ster, mary the wife of cle@@ op@@ ha@@ s, and mary magdalene .
when jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he lo@@ ved, he saith unto his mother, woman, behold thy son !
then saith he to the disciple, behold thy mother ! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
after this, jesus knowing that all things were now accompli@@ shed, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, i thirst .
now there was set a vessel full of vine@@ ga@@ r : and they filled a sp@@ un@@ ge with vine@@ gar@@ , and put it upon hy@@ s@@ so@@ p, and put it to his mouth .
when jesus therefore had received the vine@@ gar@@ , he said, it is fin@@ ished : and he bo@@ wed his head, and gave up the ghost .
the jews therefore, because it was the pre@@ para@@ tion, that the bo@@ di@@ es should not rema@@ in upon the cross on the sabbath day, besought pilate that their le@@ gs might be bro@@ ken, and that they might be taken away .
then came the soldiers, and brake the le@@ gs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him .
but when they came to jesus, and saw that he was dead al@@ ready, they brake not his le@@ gs :
but one of the soldiers with a spea@@ r pi@@ er@@ ced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water .
and he that saw it bare recor@@ d, and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe .
for these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, a b@@ one of him shall not be broken .
and again another scripture saith, they shall look on him whom they pi@@ er@@ ced .
and after this joseph of ari@@ ma@@ tha@@ e@@ a, being a disciple of jesus, but secre@@ tly for fear of the jews, besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus : and pilate gave him leave . he came therefore, and took the body of jesus .
and there came also nico@@ de@@ mu@@ s, which at the first came to jesus by night, and brought a mi@@ x@@ ture of my@@ r@@ r@@ h and al@@ o@@ es, about an hundred p@@ ound we@@ i@@ ght .
then took they the body of jesus, and w@@ ound it in linen clothes with the spi@@ ces, as the manner of the jews is to bu@@ ry .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a gar@@ den ; and in the gar@@ den a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid .
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews ' pre@@ par@@ ation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
the first day of the we@@ e@@ k cometh mary magdalene ear@@ ly, when it was yet dar@@ k, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
then she run@@ ne@@ th, and cometh to simon peter, and to the other disciple, whom jesus lo@@ ved, and saith unto them, they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him .
peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre .
so they ran both together : and the other disciple did ou@@ tru@@ n peter, and came first to the sepulchre .
and he sto@@ op@@ ing down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
then cometh simon peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes li@@ e ,
and the na@@ p@@ k@@ in, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself .
then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he sa@@ w, and believed .
for as yet they knew not the scriptu@@ re, that he must rise again from the dead .
then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she we@@ pt, she sto@@ op@@ ed down, and looked into the sepulchre ,
and seeth two angels in white si@@ tt@@ ing, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of jesus had la@@ in .
and they say unto her, woman, why weep@@ est thou ? she saith unto them, because they have taken away my lord, and i know not where they have laid him .
and when she had thus said, she turned hersel@@ f ba@@ ck, and saw jesus standing, and knew not that it was jesus .
jesus saith unto her, woman, why weep@@ est thou ? whom see@@ kest thou ? she@@ , sup@@ pos@@ ing him to be the gar@@ den@@ er, saith unto him, sir, if thou have bor@@ ne him hen@@ ce, tell me where thou hast laid him, and i will take him away .
jesus saith unto her, mary . she turned hersel@@ f, and saith unto him, rab@@ bon@@ i ; which is to say, master .
jesus saith unto her, touch me not ; for i am not yet as@@ cen@@ ded to my father : but go to my brethren, and say unto them, i as@@ c@@ end unto my father, and your father ; and to my god, and your god .
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her .
then the same day at even@@ ing, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews, came jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, peace be unto you .
and when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side . then were the disciples gla@@ d, when they saw the lord .
then said jesus to them again, peace be unto you : as my father hath sent me, even so send i you .
and when he had said this, he brea@@ the@@ d on them, and saith unto them, receive ye the holy ghost :
whose soever sins ye re@@ mi@@ t, they are re@@ mi@@ tted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye re@@ tain, they are re@@ ta@@ ined .
but thomas, one of the twelve, called di@@ d@@ y@@ mu@@ s, was not with them when jesus came .
the other disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the lord . but he said unto them, except i shall see in his hands the print of the na@@ i@@ ls, and put my fing@@ er into the print of the na@@ i@@ ls, and thrust my hand into his side, i will not believe .
and after ei@@ ght days again his disciples were with@@ in, and tho@@ m@@ as with them : then came jesus, the doors being shu@@ t, and stood in the midst, and said, peace be unto you .
then saith he to thomas, rea@@ ch hither thy fing@@ er, and behold my hands ; and rea@@ ch hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side : and be not faith@@ les@@ s, but belie@@ ving .
and tho@@ m@@ as answered and said unto him, my lord and my god .
jesus saith unto him, thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not se@@ en, and yet have believed .
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book :
but these are written, that ye might believe that jesus is the christ, the son of god ; and that belie@@ ving ye might have life through his name .
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of ti@@ ber@@ i@@ as ; and on this wise shewed he himself .
there were together simon peter, and tho@@ m@@ as called di@@ d@@ y@@ mu@@ s, and nathana@@ el of can@@ a in galilee, and the sons of zebedee, and two other of his disciples .
simon peter saith unto them, i go a fi@@ shi@@ ng . they say unto him, we also go with thee . they went forth, and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
but when the morning was now come, jesus stood on the shor@@ e : but the disciples knew not that it was jesus .
then jesus saith unto them, children, have ye any meat ? they answered him, no .
and he said unto them, cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find . they cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter, it is the lord . now when simon peter heard that it was the lord, he gir@@ t his fishe@@ r 's co@@ at unto him, and did cast himself into the sea .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; dra@@ g@@ ging the net with fishes .
as soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of co@@ al@@ s there, and fi@@ sh laid there@@ on, and bread .
jesus saith unto them, bring of the fi@@ sh which ye have now caught .
simon peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishe@@ s, an hundred and fif@@ ty and three : and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken .
jesus saith unto them, come and d@@ ine . and none of the disciples du@@ rst ask him, who art thou ? knowing that it was the lord .
jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fi@@ sh likewise .
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead .
so when they had d@@ in@@ ed, jesus saith to simon peter, simon, son of jon@@ as, lo@@ vest thou me more than these ? he saith unto him, yea, lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him, fe@@ ed my la@@ mbs .
he saith to him again the second time, simon, son of jon@@ as, lo@@ vest thou me ? he saith unto him, yea, lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him, fe@@ ed my sheep .
he saith unto him the third time, simon, son of jon@@ as, lo@@ vest thou me ? peter was grie@@ ved because he said unto him the third time, lo@@ vest thou me ? and he said unto him, lord, thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that i love thee . jesus saith unto him, fe@@ ed my sheep .
verily, verily, i say unto thee, when thou wa@@ st you@@ ng, thou gir@@ dest thyself, and wal@@ ke@@ dst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stret@@ ch forth thy hands, and another shall gi@@ rd thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
this spake he, signi@@ fying by what death he should glorify god . and when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, follow me .
then peter, tur@@ ning about, seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following ; which also le@@ an@@ ed on his brea@@ st at sup@@ per, and said, lord, which is he that betra@@ yeth thee ?
peter seeing him saith to jesus, lord, and what shall this man do ?
jesus saith unto him, if i will that he tarry till i come, what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die : yet jesus said not unto him, he shall not die ; but, if i will that he tarry till i come, what is that to thee ?
this is the disciple which testi@@ fi@@ eth of these things, and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
and there are also many other things which jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, i suppo@@ se that even the world itself could not con@@ tain the boo@@ ks that should be written . a@@ men .
the book of the generation of jesus christ, the son of david, the son of abraham .
abraham begat isa@@ a@@ c ; and isa@@ a@@ c begat jacob ; and jacob begat judas and his brethren ;
and judas begat pha@@ res and zar@@ a of th@@ ama@@ r ; and pha@@ res begat es@@ rom ; and es@@ rom begat ar@@ am ;
and ar@@ am begat a@@ min@@ a@@ da@@ b ; and a@@ min@@ a@@ da@@ b begat na@@ as@@ son ; and na@@ as@@ son begat sal@@ mon ;
and sal@@ mon begat boo@@ z of ra@@ cha@@ b ; and boo@@ z begat ob@@ ed of ru@@ th ; and ob@@ ed begat jes@@ se ;
and jes@@ se begat david the king ; and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of u@@ ri@@ as ;
and solomon begat ro@@ bo@@ am ; and ro@@ bo@@ am begat abi@@ a ; and abi@@ a begat as@@ a ;
and as@@ a begat jo@@ sa@@ pha@@ t ; and jo@@ sa@@ pha@@ t begat jor@@ am ; and jor@@ am begat o@@ z@@ i@@ as ;
and o@@ z@@ i@@ as begat jo@@ a@@ th@@ am ; and jo@@ a@@ th@@ am begat acha@@ z ; and acha@@ z begat e@@ ze@@ ki@@ as ;
and e@@ ze@@ ki@@ as begat man@@ as@@ ses ; and man@@ as@@ ses begat a@@ mon ; and a@@ mon begat jo@@ sias ;
and jo@@ sias begat je@@ ch@@ oni@@ as and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on :
and after they were brought to b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on, je@@ ch@@ oni@@ as begat sa@@ la@@ thie@@ l ; and sa@@ la@@ thie@@ l begat z@@ or@@ o@@ ba@@ be@@ l ;
and z@@ or@@ o@@ ba@@ be@@ l begat abi@@ u@@ d ; and abi@@ u@@ d begat eli@@ a@@ ki@@ m ; and eli@@ a@@ ki@@ m begat a@@ z@@ or ;
and a@@ z@@ or begat sa@@ do@@ c ; and sa@@ do@@ c begat ac@@ him ; and ac@@ him begat eli@@ u@@ d ;
and eli@@ u@@ d begat e@@ lea@@ z@@ ar ; and e@@ lea@@ z@@ ar begat mat@@ than ; and mat@@ than begat jacob ;
and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary, of whom was born jesus, who is called christ .
so all the genera@@ tions from abraham to david are four@@ teen genera@@ tions ; and from david until the car@@ rying away into b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on are four@@ teen genera@@ tions ; and from the car@@ rying away into b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on unto christ are four@@ teen genera@@ tions .
now the bir@@ th of jesus christ was on this wise : when as his mother mary was es@@ p@@ ou@@ sed to joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the holy ghost .
then joseph her husb@@ and, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publi@@ ck exa@@ m@@ ple, was min@@ ded to put her away pri@@ vi@@ ly .
but while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a drea@@ m, saying, joseph, thou son of david, fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife : for that which is con@@ cei@@ ved in her is of the holy ghost .
and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet, saying ,
behold, a virg@@ in shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name e@@ m@@ man@@ u@@ e@@ l, which being interpre@@ ted is, god with us .
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife :
and knew her not till she had brought forth her fir@@ st@@ born son : and he called his name jesus .
now when jesus was born in bethlehe@@ m of judaea in the days of herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the ea@@ st to jerusalem ,
saying, where is he that is born king of the jews ? for we have seen his st@@ ar in the ea@@ st, and are come to worship him .
when herod the king had heard these things, he was troub@@ led, and all jerusalem with him .
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he de@@ man@@ ded of them where christ should be born .
and they said unto him, in bethlehe@@ m of judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
and thou bethlehe@@ m, in the land of juda@@ , art not the least among the prin@@ ces of jud@@ a : for out of thee shall come a gover@@ n@@ or, that shall ru@@ le my people israel .
then herod, when he had pri@@ vi@@ ly called the wise men, en@@ quired of them di@@ ligen@@ tly what time the st@@ ar appeared .
and he sent them to bethlehe@@ m, and said, go and se@@ ar@@ ch di@@ ligen@@ tly for the young child ; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that i may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king, they departed ; and, lo, the st@@ ar, which they saw in the ea@@ st, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was .
when they saw the st@@ ar, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
and when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasu@@ res, they presen@@ ted unto him gif@@ ts ; go@@ ld, and f@@ ran@@ kin@@ cen@@ se and my@@ r@@ r@@ h .
and being war@@ ned of god in a drea@@ m that they should not return to herod, they departed into their own country another way .
and when they were departed, behold, the angel of the lord appea@@ reth to joseph in a drea@@ m, saying, arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into egypt, and be thou there until i bring thee word : for herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
when he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into egypt :
and was there until the death of herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet, saying, out of egypt have i called my son .
then herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wro@@ th, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in bethlehe@@ m, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and und@@ er, according to the time which he had di@@ ligen@@ tly en@@ quired of the wise men .
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by je@@ re@@ my the prophet, saying ,
in ra@@ m@@ a was there a voice heard, la@@ men@@ tation, and weep@@ ing, and great mour@@ ning, ra@@ che@@ l weeping for her children, and would not be comfor@@ ted, because they are not .
but when herod was dead, behold, an angel of the lord appea@@ reth in a drea@@ m to joseph in egypt ,
saying, arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
and he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of israel .
but when he heard that ar@@ che@@ la@@ us did re@@ ign in judaea in the room of his father herod, he was afraid to go thither : notwith@@ standing, being war@@ ned of god in a drea@@ m, he turned aside into the par@@ ts of galilee :
and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, he shall be called a naza@@ ren@@ e .
in those days came john the bapti@@ st, preaching in the wilderness of judaea ,
and saying, repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esai@@ as, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his pa@@ th@@ s straight .
and the same john had his raiment of ca@@ mel 's hai@@ r, and a lea@@ ther@@ n gir@@ dle about his lo@@ ins ; and his meat was lo@@ cu@@ sts and wi@@ ld hon@@ e@@ y .
then went out to him jerusalem, and all judaea, and all the region round about jordan ,
and were baptized of him in jordan, confes@@ sing their sins .
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptis@@ m, he said unto them, o generation of vi@@ pers, who hath war@@ ned you to flee from the wra@@ th to come ?
bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
and think not to say within yourselves, we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you, that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
and now also the a@@ x@@ e is laid unto the roo@@ t of the tre@@ es : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire .
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is migh@@ ti@@ er than i, whose shoes i am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost, and with fire :
whose fa@@ n is in his hand, and he will through@@ ly pur@@ ge his flo@@ or, and gather his wheat into the gar@@ ner ; but he will bur@@ n up the cha@@ f@@ f with un@@ quen@@ cha@@ ble fire .
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john, to be baptized of him .
but john for@@ ba@@ d him, saying, i have need to be baptized of thee, and com@@ est thou to me ?
and jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now : for thus it be@@ cometh us to fulfi@@ l all righteousness . then he suffered him .
and jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water : and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of god descen@@ ding like a do@@ ve, and light@@ ing upon him :
and l@@ o a voice from heaven, saying, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased .
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be temp@@ ted of the devil .
and when he had fast@@ ed forty days and forty nigh@@ ts, he was afterward an hun@@ g@@ red .
and when the temp@@ ter came to him, he said, if thou be the son of god, command that these stones be made bread .
but he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proce@@ e@@ deth out of the mouth of god .
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and se@@ tteth him on a p@@ in@@ nac@@ le of the temple ,
and saith unto him, if thou be the son of god, cast thyself down : for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou d@@ as@@ h thy foot against a stone .
jesus said unto him, it is written again, thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and she@@ weth him all the king@@ do@@ ms of the world, and the glory of them ;
and saith unto him, all these things will i give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
then saith jesus unto him, get thee hen@@ ce, satan : for it is written, thou shalt worship the lord thy god, and him only shalt thou serve .
then the devil lea@@ veth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him .
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison, he departed into galilee ;
and lea@@ ving nazareth, he came and dwelt in capernaum, which is upon the sea coa@@ st, in the bor@@ d@@ ers of za@@ bu@@ l@@ on and ne@@ ph@@ tha@@ li@@ m :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying ,
the land of za@@ bu@@ l@@ on, and the land of ne@@ ph@@ tha@@ li@@ m, by the way of the sea, beyond jordan, galilee of the gentiles ;
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sp@@ run@@ g up .
from that time jesus began to prea@@ ch, and to say, repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
and jesus, walking by the sea of galilee, saw two brethren, simon called peter, and andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea : for they were fishe@@ rs .
and he saith unto them, follow me, and i will make you fishe@@ rs of men .
and they straightway left their ne@@ ts, and followed him .
and going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, james the son of zebedee, and john his brother, in a ship with zebede@@ e their father, men@@ ding their ne@@ ts ; and he called them .
and they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him .
and jesus went about all galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sick@@ ness and all manner of dise@@ ase among the people .
and his fame went throughout all syri@@ a : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers disea@@ ses and tor@@ ments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were l@@ un@@ a@@ ti@@ ck, and those that had the pal@@ sy ; and he healed them .
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee, and from de@@ ca@@ po@@ li@@ s, and from jerusalem, and from judaea, and from beyond jordan .
and seeing the multitu@@ des, he went up into a mountain : and when he was se@@ t, his disciples came unto him :
and he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying ,
blessed are the poor in spirit : for the@@ i@@ rs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are they that mour@@ n : for they shall be comfor@@ ted .
blessed are the me@@ e@@ k : for they shall inherit the earth .
blessed are they which do hun@@ ger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
blessed are the mer@@ ci@@ ful : for they shall ob@@ tain mercy .
blessed are the pu@@ re in heart : for they shall see god .
blessed are the pea@@ ce@@ ma@@ k@@ ers : for they shall be called the children of god .
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for the@@ i@@ rs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are ye, when men shall re@@ vi@@ le you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you fal@@ sel@@ y, for my sake .
rejoi@@ ce, and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his sa@@ v@@ our, wherewith shall it be sal@@ ted ? it is then@@ ce@@ forth good for no@@ thing, but to be cast out, and to be tro@@ d@@ den under foot of men .
ye are the light of the world . a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
neither do men light a can@@ dle, and put it under a bu@@ she@@ l, but on a can@@ d@@ les@@ ti@@ ck ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
let your light so shi@@ ne before men, that they may see your good wor@@ ks, and glorify your father which is in heaven .
think not that i am come to destroy the law, or the prophets : i am not come to destro@@ y, but to fulfi@@ l .
for verily i say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jo@@ t or one ti@@ ttle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled .
whosoever therefore shall brea@@ k one of these least command@@ ments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
for i say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exce@@ ed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no ca@@ se enter into the kingdom of heaven .
ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
but i say unto you, that whosoever is an@@ g@@ ry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother, ra@@ ca@@ , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say, thou foo@@ l, shall be in danger of hell fire .
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the al@@ tar@@ , and there reme@@ mbe@@ rest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
leave there thy gift before the al@@ tar@@ , and go thy way ; first be re@@ con@@ ci@@ led to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift .
agre@@ e with thine ad@@ versa@@ ry quick@@ ly, whi@@ les thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the ad@@ versa@@ ry deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer@@ , and thou be cast into prison .
verily i say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast pa@@ id the uttermost far@@ thing .
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery :
but i say unto you, that whosoever loo@@ keth on a woman to lu@@ st after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
and if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee : for it is profi@@ table for thee that one of thy me@@ mb@@ ers should per@@ ish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
and if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee : for it is profi@@ table for thee that one of thy me@@ mb@@ ers should per@@ ish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
it hath been said, whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ ment :
but i say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, sa@@ ving for the cause of forni@@ ca@@ tion, ca@@ u@@ seth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall mar@@ ry her that is di@@ v@@ or@@ ced committeth adultery .
again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not for@@ swear thyself, but shalt perfor@@ m unto the lord thine oa@@ th@@ s :
but i say unto you, swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is god 's throne :
nor by the earth ; for it is his foo@@ tstool : neither by jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great king .
neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one ha@@ ir white or bla@@ ck .
but let your comm@@ un@@ i@@ cation be, yea, ye@@ a ; na@@ y, nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a too@@ th for a too@@ th :
but i say unto you, that ye resi@@ st not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right che@@ ek, turn to him the other also .
and if any man will su@@ e thee at the law, and take away thy co@@ at, let him have thy clo@@ a@@ k also .
and whosoever shall com@@ pe@@ l thee to go a mi@@ le, go with him twain .
give to him that as@@ keth thee, and from him that would bor@@ row of thee turn not thou away .
ye have heard that it hath been said, thou shalt love thy neighb@@ our, and hate thine ene@@ my .
but i say unto you, love your enemi@@ es, bles@@ s them that cur@@ se you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despi@@ te@@ fully use you, and persecute you ;
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven : for he ma@@ keth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sen@@ deth ra@@ in on the just and on the unjust .
for if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
and if ye salu@@ te your brethren only, what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
be ye therefore perfec@@ t, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect .
take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them : o@@ ther@@ wise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven .
therefore when thou doest thine al@@ ms, do not sound a tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the stree@@ ts, that they may have glory of men . verily i say unto you, they have their reward .
but when thou doest al@@ ms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
that thine alms may be in secret : and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
and when thou pray@@ est, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the cor@@ ners of the stree@@ ts, that they may be seen of men . verily i say unto you, they have their reward .
but thou, when thou pray@@ est, enter into thy clo@@ se@@ t, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret ; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
but when ye pray, use not va@@ in re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions, as the hea@@ then do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
be not ye therefore like unto them : for your father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him .
after this manner therefore pray ye : our father which art in heaven, ha@@ llo@@ wed be thy name .
thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread .
and forgive us our deb@@ ts, as we forgive our deb@@ tor@@ s .
and lead us not into temp@@ tation, but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever . a@@ men .
for if ye forgive men their trespas@@ ses, your heavenly father will also forgive you :
but if ye forgive not men their trespas@@ ses, neither will your father forgive your trespas@@ ses .
moreover when ye fa@@ st, be not, as the hypocri@@ tes, of a sa@@ d coun@@ ten@@ ance : for they dis@@ fi@@ gu@@ re their fa@@ ces, that they may appear unto men to fast . verily i say unto you, they have their reward .
but thou, when thou fast@@ est, anoin@@ t thine head, and wash thy face ;
that thou appear not unto men to fa@@ st, but unto thy father which is in secret : and thy father, which seeth in secre@@ t, shall reward thee openly .
lay not up for yourselves treasu@@ res upon earth, where mo@@ th and rust doth corrup@@ t, and where thieves brea@@ k through and ste@@ al :
but lay up for yourselves treasu@@ res in heaven, where neither mo@@ th nor rust doth corrup@@ t, and where thieves do not brea@@ k through nor ste@@ al :
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also .
the light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be s@@ ing@@ le, thy whole body shall be full of light .
but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in thee be dark@@ ness, how great is that darkness !
no man can serve two masters : for e@@ ither he will hate the one, and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one, and despi@@ se the other . ye cannot serve god and ma@@ m@@ mon .
therefore i say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on . is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment ?
behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not, neither do they rea@@ p, nor gather into bar@@ ns ; yet your heavenly father fee@@ deth them . are ye not much better than they ?
which of you by taking thought can add one cu@@ b@@ it unto his sta@@ ture ?
and why take ye thought for raiment ? consi@@ der the li@@ lie@@ s of the field, how they g@@ row ; they to@@ il not, neither do they sp@@ in :
and yet i say unto you, that even solomon in all his glory was not ar@@ ra@@ yed like one of these .
where@@ fore, if god so clo@@ the the gra@@ ss of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the o@@ ven, shall he not much more clo@@ the you, o ye of little faith ?
therefore take no thou@@ ght, saying, what shall we eat ? or, what shall we drink ? or, where@@ with@@ al shall we be clothed ?
for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
but seek ye first the kingdom of god, and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . suf@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent unto the day is the evil thereof .
judge not, that ye be not judged .
for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye me@@ te, it shall be measu@@ red to you again .
and why beho@@ ldest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye, but consi@@ de@@ rest not the be@@ am that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pu@@ ll out the mote out of thine eye ; and, behold, a be@@ am is in thine own eye ?
thou hypocri@@ te, first cast out the be@@ am out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see cle@@ ar@@ ly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
give not that which is holy unto the do@@ g@@ s, neither cast ye your pe@@ ar@@ ls before s@@ win@@ e, lest they tra@@ mp@@ le them under their feet, and turn again and ren@@ d you .
as@@ k, and it shall be given you ; see@@ k, and ye shall find ; kno@@ ck, and it shall be opened unto you :
for every one that as@@ keth receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ keth it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone ?
or if he ask a fi@@ s@@ h, will he give him a ser@@ p@@ ent ?
if ye then, being evil, know how to give good gif@@ ts unto your children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
enter ye in at the stra@@ it gate : for wi@@ de is the ga@@ te, and bro@@ ad is the way, that lea@@ deth to des@@ tru@@ ction, and many there be which go in there@@ at :
because stra@@ it is the ga@@ te, and n@@ ar@@ row is the way, which lea@@ deth unto life, and few there be that find it .
beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep 's clo@@ thing, but in@@ war@@ dly they are ra@@ ven@@ ing wol@@ ves .
ye shall know them by their fruits . do men gather gra@@ pes of thorns, or fi@@ gs of thi@@ st@@ les ?
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrup@@ t tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrup@@ t tree bring forth good fruit .
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire .
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
not every one that saith unto me, lord, lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven .
many will say to me in that day, lord, lord, have we not prophesi@@ ed in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wond@@ er@@ ful works ?
and then will i pro@@ fes@@ s unto them, i never knew you : depart from me, ye that work iniquity .
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, i will li@@ ken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock :
and the ra@@ in descen@@ ded, and the f@@ loo@@ ds came, and the winds ble@@ w, and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was f@@ ounded upon a rock .
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be li@@ k@@ ened unto a foo@@ li@@ sh man, which built his house upon the s@@ and :
and the ra@@ in descen@@ ded, and the f@@ loo@@ ds came, and the winds ble@@ w, and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
and it came to pass, when jesus had en@@ ded these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine :
for he taught them as one having author@@ i@@ ty, and not as the scribes .

when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him .
and, behold, there came a le@@ per and worshipped him, saying, lord, if thou wil@@ t, thou canst make me clean .
and jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, i will ; be thou clean . and immediately his le@@ pro@@ sy was cle@@ ans@@ ed .
and jesus saith unto him, see thou tell no man ; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that moses comman@@ ded, for a testimony unto them .
and when jesus was entered into capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, besee@@ ching him ,
and saying, lord, my servant lie@@ th at home sick of the pal@@ sy, grie@@ v@@ ously tor@@ men@@ ted .
and jesus saith unto him, i will come and heal him .
the centurion answered and said, lord, i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my ro@@ of : but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed .
for i am a man under author@@ i@@ ty, having soldiers under me : and i say to this man, go, and he goeth ; and to another, come, and he cometh ; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth it .
when jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that follo@@ wed, verily i say unto you, i have not found so great faith, no, not in israel .
and i say unto you, that many shall come from the ea@@ st and w@@ est, and shall sit down with abraham, and isaac, and jaco@@ b, in the kingdom of heaven .
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into ou@@ ter darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
and jesus said unto the centurion, go thy way ; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the sel@@ f@@ same hour .
and when jesus was come into peter 's house, he saw his wife 's mother la@@ i@@ d, and sick of a fever .
and he touched her hand, and the fever left her : and she arose, and ministered unto them .
when the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying, himself took our infirmi@@ ties, and bare our sick@@ nes@@ ses .
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
and a certain scri@@ be came, and said unto him, master, i will follow thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou goest .
and jesus saith unto him, the fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les, and the bir@@ ds of the air have nes@@ ts ; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and another of his disciples said unto him, lord, suffer me first to go and bu@@ ry my father .
but jesus said unto him, follow me ; and let the dead bu@@ ry their dead .
and when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him .
and, behold, there arose a great temp@@ est in the sea, insomuch that the ship was co@@ vered with the wa@@ ves : but he was asle@@ ep .
and his disciples came to him, and a@@ wo@@ ke him, saying, lord, save us : we perish .
and he saith unto them, why are ye fe@@ ar@@ ful, o ye of little faith ? then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great cal@@ m .
but the men marvelled, saying, what manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him !
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the g@@ er@@ g@@ es@@ en@@ es, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the to@@ mb@@ s, exceeding fi@@ er@@ ce, so that no man might pass by that way .
and, behold, they cried out, saying, what have we to do with thee, jesus, thou son of god ? art thou come hither to tor@@ ment us before the time ?
and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine fee@@ ding .
so the devils besought him, saying, if thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
and he said unto them, go . and when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine : and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran vio@@ len@@ tly down a ste@@ ep place into the sea, and per@@ ished in the wa@@ ters .
and they that kept them f@@ led, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was be@@ fallen to the possessed of the devils .
and, behold, the whole city came out to meet jesus : and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
and he entered into a ship, and passed o@@ ver, and came into his own city .
and, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the pal@@ sy, lying on a bed : and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy ; son, be of good che@@ er ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
and, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, this man blasphe@@ meth .
and jesus knowing their though@@ ts said, wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
for whether is easi@@ er, to say, thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say, arise, and walk ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house .
and he arose, and departed to his house .
but when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified god, which had given such power unto men .
and as jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named mat@@ the@@ w, sitting at the recei@@ pt of custom : and he saith unto him, follow me . and he arose, and followed him .
and it came to pass, as jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
and when the pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, why eateth your master with publicans and sinners ?
but when jesus heard that, he said unto them, they that be whole need not a physici@@ an, but they that are sick .
but go ye and lear@@ n what that me@@ an@@ eth, i will have mer@@ c@@ y, and not sacrifice : for i am not come to call the righte@@ ous, but sinners to repentance .
then came to him the disciples of john, saying, why do we and the pharisees fast of@@ t, but thy disciples fast not ?
and jesus said unto them, can the children of the bride@@ cha@@ mber mour@@ n, as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast .
no man putteth a piece of new clo@@ th unto an old gar@@ ment, for that which is put in to fi@@ ll it up taketh from the gar@@ ment, and the rent is made worse .
neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles brea@@ k, and the wine run@@ ne@@ th out, and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bott@@ les, and both are pre@@ served .
while he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain rul@@ er, and worshipped him, saying, my daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live .
and jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples .
and, behold, a woman, which was dise@@ ased with an is@@ su@@ e of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the he@@ m of his garment :
for she said within hersel@@ f, if i may but touch his gar@@ ment, i shall be whole .
but jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, daugh@@ ter, be of good comfor@@ t ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and when jesus came into the ruler 's house, and saw the min@@ stre@@ ls and the people ma@@ king a no@@ i@@ se ,
he said unto them, give place : for the maid is not dead, but sle@@ e@@ peth . and they lau@@ g@@ he@@ d him to s@@ corn .
but when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose .
and the fame here@@ of went abroad into all that land .
and when jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, c@@ ry@@ ing, and saying, thou son of david, have mercy on us .
and when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him : and jesus saith unto them, believe ye that i am able to do this ? they said unto him, yea, lord .
then touched he their eyes, saying, according to your faith be it unto you .
and their eyes were opened ; and jesus straitly charged them, saying, see that no man know it .
but they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country .
as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
and when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled, saying, it was never so seen in israel .
but the pharisees said, he ca@@ ste@@ th out devils through the prince of the devils .
and jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sick@@ ness and every dise@@ ase among the people .
but when he saw the multitu@@ des, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fa@@ in@@ ted, and were scattered abro@@ a@@ d, as sheep having no shepherd .
then saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is p@@ l@@ ente@@ ous, but the labourers are few ;
pray ye therefore the lord of the har@@ v@@ est, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spiri@@ ts, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sick@@ ness and all manner of dise@@ ase .
now the na@@ mes of the twelve apostles are these ; the first, simon, who is called peter, and andrew his brother ; james the son of zebedee, and john his brother ;
philip, and bar@@ tho@@ lo@@ me@@ w ; thomas, and mat@@ the@@ w the publi@@ can ; james the son of al@@ pha@@ eus, and le@@ bba@@ eus, whose surname was th@@ ad@@ da@@ e@@ us ;
simon the can@@ a@@ ani@@ te, and judas iscariot, who also betrayed him .
these twelve jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, go not into the way of the gentiles, and into any city of the samarit@@ ans enter ye not :
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel .
and as ye go, prea@@ ch, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
heal the sick, clean@@ se the le@@ pers, raise the dead, cast out devils : fre@@ e@@ ly ye have recei@@ ved, fre@@ e@@ ly give .
pro@@ vi@@ de neither go@@ ld, nor sil@@ ver, nor bra@@ ss in your pur@@ ses ,
nor scri@@ p for your journey, neither two coa@@ ts, neither sho@@ es, nor yet sta@@ ves : for the wor@@ k@@ man is worthy of his meat .
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall en@@ ter, enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
and when ye come into an house, salu@@ te it .
and if the house be wor@@ th@@ y, let your peace come upon it : but if it be not wor@@ th@@ y, let your peace return to you .
and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, sha@@ ke off the du@@ st of your feet .
verily i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of so@@ dom and go@@ mor@@ r@@ h@@ a in the day of judgment, than for that city .
behold, i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wol@@ ves : be ye therefore wise as ser@@ pen@@ ts, and har@@ m@@ less as do@@ ves .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the counci@@ ls, and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
and ye shall be brought before gover@@ n@@ ors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the gentiles .
but when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
for it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that en@@ du@@ reth to the end shall be saved .
but when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another : for verily i say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel, till the son of man be come .
the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord .
it is en@@ ough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord . if they have called the master of the house beelzebu@@ b, how much more shall they call them of his house@@ hold ?
fear them not therefore : for there is nothing cove@@ red, that shall not be revealed ; and hi@@ d, that shall not be known .
what i tell you in dark@@ ness, that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear@@ , that preach ye upon the house@@ to@@ ps .
and fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
are not two sp@@ ar@@ row@@ s sold for a far@@ thing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father .
but the very hai@@ rs of your head are all nu@@ mbered .
fear ye not therefore, ye are of more v@@ al@@ u@@ e than many sp@@ ar@@ row@@ s .
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven .
but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven .
think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace, but a sword .
for i am come to set a man at v@@ ari@@ ance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and a man 's fo@@ es shall be they of his own house@@ hold .
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
and he that taketh not his cross, and follo@@ weth after me, is not worthy of me .
he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that lo@@ seth his life for my sake shall find it .
he that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of co@@ ld water only in the name of a disciple, verily i say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward .
and it came to pass, when jesus had made an end of comman@@ ding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ, he sent two of his disciples ,
and said unto him, art thou he that should come, or do we look for another ?
jesus answered and said unto them, go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see :
the blind receive their sight, and the lame wal@@ k, the le@@ pers are clean@@ sed, and the dea@@ f hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
and blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me .
and as they departed, jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john, what went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a re@@ ed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in so@@ ft raiment ? behold, they that we@@ ar so@@ ft clo@@ thing are in kings ' hou@@ ses .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea, i say unto you, and more than a prophet .
for this is he, of whom it is written, behold, i send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee .
verily i say unto you, among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist : notwith@@ standing he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffe@@ reth vio@@ len@@ ce, and the viol@@ ent take it by for@@ ce .
for all the prophets and the law prophesi@@ ed until john .
and if ye will receive it, this is eli@@ as, which was for to come .
he that hath ears to hear, let him hear .
but whereunto shall i li@@ ken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the marke@@ ts, and calling unto their fellow@@ s ,
and saying, we have pi@@ ped unto you, and ye have not d@@ an@@ ced ; we have mour@@ ned unto you, and ye have not la@@ men@@ ted .
for john came neither ea@@ ting nor drin@@ king, and they say, he hath a devil .
the son of man came ea@@ ting and drin@@ king, and they say, behold a man g@@ lu@@ tt@@ on@@ ous, and a win@@ e@@ bi@@ b@@ b@@ er, a fri@@ end of publicans and sinners . but wisdom is justified of her children .
then began he to up@@ b@@ rai@@ d the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not :
woe unto thee, ch@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ in ! woe unto thee, bethsai@@ da ! for if the mighty wor@@ ks, which were done in you, had been done in tyre and sidon, they would have repented long a@@ go in sa@@ ck@@ clo@@ th and as@@ he@@ s .
but i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sid@@ on at the day of judgment, than for you .
and thou, capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty wor@@ ks, which have been done in thee, had been done in so@@ dom, it would have remained until this day .
but i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of so@@ dom in the day of judgment, than for thee .
at that time jesus answered and said, i thank thee, o father, lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and p@@ ru@@ den@@ t, and hast revealed them unto ba@@ bes .
even so, father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
all things are delivered unto me of my father : and no man knoweth the son, but the father ; neither knoweth any man the father, save the son, and he to whomsoever the son will reve@@ al him .
come unto me, all ye that lab@@ our and are heavy la@@ d@@ en, and i will give you rest .
take my y@@ o@@ ke upon you, and lear@@ n of me ; for i am me@@ e@@ k and lo@@ w@@ ly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
for my y@@ o@@ ke is e@@ as@@ y, and my bur@@ den is light .
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat .
but when the pharisees saw it, they said unto him, behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
but he said unto them, have ye not read what david did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him ;
how he entered into the house of god, and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests ?
or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple pro@@ f@@ an@@ e the sabba@@ th, and are bla@@ me@@ less ?
but i say unto you, that in this place is one greater than the temple .
but if ye had known what this me@@ an@@ eth, i will have mer@@ c@@ y, and not sacrifi@@ ce, ye would not have condemned the gui@@ l@@ t@@ less .
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day .
and when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue :
and, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered . and they asked him, saying, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
and he said unto them, what man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a p@@ it on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out ?
how much then is a man better than a sheep ? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
then saith he to the man, stret@@ ch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was re@@ sto@@ red who@@ le, like as the other .
then the pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him .
but when jesus knew it, he with@@ drew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all ;
and charged them that they should not make him known :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying ,
behold my servant, whom i have chosen ; my be@@ lo@@ ved, in whom my soul is well pleased : i will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles .
he shall not stri@@ ve, nor c@@ ry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the stree@@ ts .
a b@@ ru@@ ised re@@ ed shall he not brea@@ k, and s@@ mo@@ king f@@ la@@ x shall he not quen@@ ch, till he send forth judgment unto vi@@ ctor@@ y .
and in his name shall the gentiles tru@@ st .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb : and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
and all the people were amazed, and said, is not this the son of david ?
but when the pharisees heard it, they said, this fellow doth not cast out devils, but by beelzebu@@ b the prince of the devils .
and jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to deso@@ lation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
and if satan cast out sa@@ t@@ an, he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
and if i by beelzebu@@ b cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your jud@@ ges .
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god, then the kingdom of god is come unto you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house, and spo@@ il his goo@@ ds, except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spo@@ il his house .
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that ga@@ there@@ th not with me scatte@@ reth abroad .
wherefore i say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphe@@ my shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphe@@ my against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come .
e@@ ither make the tree good, and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrup@@ t, and his fruit corrup@@ t : for the tree is known by his fruit .
o generation of vi@@ pers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
but i say unto you, that every i@@ dle word that men shall speak, they shall give ac@@ coun@@ t thereof in the day of judgment .
for by thy words thou shalt be justi@@ fied, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered, saying, master, we would see a sign from thee .
but he answered and said unto them, an evil and adulter@@ ous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet jonas :
for as jonas was three days and three nigh@@ ts in the wha@@ le 's be@@ l@@ ly ; so shall the son of man be three days and three nigh@@ ts in the heart of the earth .
the men of nine@@ ve@@ h shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of jonas ; and, behold, a greater than jonas is here .
the qu@@ e@@ en of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost par@@ ts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and, behold, a greater than solomon is here .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he wal@@ keth through d@@ ry places, seeking re@@ st, and findeth none .
then he saith, i will return into my house from whence i came out ; and when he is come, he findeth it e@@ mp@@ ty, swe@@ pt, and gar@@ ni@@ shed .
then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
while he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him .
then one said unto him, behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee .
but he answered and said unto him that told him, who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, behold my mother and my brethren !
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and si@@ ster, and mother .
the same day went jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side .
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shor@@ e .
and he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, behold, a so@@ wer went forth to sow ;
and when he so@@ wed, some see@@ ds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and dev@@ oured them up :
some fell upon ston@@ y places, where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sp@@ run@@ g up, because they had no de@@ ep@@ ness of earth :
and when the sun was up, they were scor@@ ched ; and because they had no roo@@ t, they withered away .
and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sp@@ run@@ g up, and cho@@ ked them :
but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundre@@ d@@ fold, some six@@ ty@@ fold, some thir@@ ty@@ fold .
who hath ears to hear, let him hear .
and the disciples came, and said unto him, why spea@@ kest thou unto them in parables ?
he answered and said unto them, because it is given unto you to know the my@@ ster@@ i@@ es of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given .
for whosoever ha@@ th, to him shall be gi@@ ven, and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
therefore speak i to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand .
and in them is fulfilled the prophe@@ cy of esai@@ as, which saith, by hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive :
for this people 's heart is waxed g@@ ro@@ ss, and their ears are du@@ ll of hear@@ ing, and their eyes they have clo@@ sed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and i should heal them .
but blessed are your eyes, for they see : and your ears, for they hear .
for verily i say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them .
hear ye therefore the parable of the so@@ wer .
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and under@@ stan@@ deth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and ca@@ t@@ che@@ th away that which was sown in his heart . this is he which received seed by the way side .
but he that received the seed into ston@@ y places, the same is he that heareth the word, and an@@ on with joy receiveth it ;
yet hath he not roo@@ t in himself, but du@@ reth for a while : for when tribu@@ lation or persecu@@ tion ari@@ seth because of the word, by and by he is offended .
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the c@@ are of this world, and the decei@@ t@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ che@@ s, cho@@ ke the word, and he be@@ cometh un@@ fru@@ it@@ ful .
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and under@@ stan@@ deth it ; which also bea@@ reth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundre@@ d@@ fold, some six@@ ty, some thirty .
another parable put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is li@@ k@@ ened unto a man which so@@ wed good seed in his field :
but while men sle@@ pt, his ene@@ my came and so@@ wed tares among the whe@@ at, and went his way .
but when the bla@@ de was sp@@ run@@ g up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also .
so the servants of the househo@@ l@@ der came and said unto him, sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
he said unto them, an ene@@ my hath done this . the servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
but he said, nay ; lest while ye gather up the ta@@ res, ye roo@@ t up also the wheat with them .
let both g@@ row together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest i will say to the rea@@ pers, gather ye together first the ta@@ res, and bind them in b@@ und@@ les to bur@@ n them : but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n .
another parable put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is like to a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard seed, which a man too@@ k, and so@@ wed in his field :
which indeed is the least of all see@@ ds : but when it is g@@ row@@ n, it is the greatest among he@@ r@@ b@@ s, and be@@ cometh a tree, so that the bir@@ ds of the air come and lo@@ dge in the branches thereof .
another parable spake he unto them ; the kingdom of heaven is like unto lea@@ ven, which a woman too@@ k, and hid in three measu@@ res of me@@ al, till the whole was leavened .
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, i will open my mouth in parables ; i will u@@ tter things which have been kept secret from the founda@@ tion of the world .
then jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him, saying, declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
he answered and said unto them, he that so@@ weth the good seed is the son of man ;
the field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
the ene@@ my that so@@ wed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the rea@@ pers are the angels .
as therefore the tares are gathered and bur@@ ned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
the son of man shall send forth his ange@@ ls, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offen@@ d, and them which do iniquity ;
and shall cast them into a fur@@ na@@ ce of fire : there shall be wai@@ ling and gnashing of teeth .
then shall the righteous shi@@ ne forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father . who hath ears to hear, let him hear .
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath f@@ ound, he hi@@ de@@ th, and for joy thereof goeth and sel@@ leth all that he ha@@ th, and bu@@ yeth that field .
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a mer@@ chan@@ t man, seeking goo@@ dly pe@@ ar@@ ls :
who, when he had found one pe@@ ar@@ l of great pri@@ ce, went and sold all that he ha@@ d, and bought it .
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a ne@@ t, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every k@@ ind :
which, when it was ful@@ l, they drew to sho@@ re, and sat down, and gathered the good into ves@@ sel@@ s, but cast the ba@@ d away .
so shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth, and se@@ ver the wicked from among the just ,
and shall cast them into the fur@@ na@@ ce of fire : there shall be wai@@ ling and gnashing of teeth .
jesus saith unto them, have ye understood all these things ? they say unto him, yea, lord .
then said he unto them, therefore every scri@@ be which is inst@@ ru@@ cted unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an househo@@ ld@@ er, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
and it came to pass, that when jesus had fin@@ ished these parables, he departed thence .
and when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astoni@@ shed, and said, whence hath this man this wis@@ dom, and these mighty works ?
is not this the car@@ p@@ enter 's son ? is not his mother called mary ? and his brethren, james, and jo@@ ses, and simon, and judas ?
and his si@@ st@@ ers, are they not all with us ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
and they were offended in him . but jesus said unto them, a prophet is not without honou@@ r, save in his own country, and in his own house .
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelie@@ f .
at that time herod the tetrar@@ ch heard of the fame of jesus ,
and said unto his servants, this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
for herod had laid hold on john, and bound him, and put him in prison for herodias ' sake, his brother philip 's wife .
for john said unto him, it is not lawful for thee to have her .
and when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet .
but when herod 's bir@@ th@@ day was ke@@ pt, the daughter of herodias d@@ an@@ ced before them, and pleased herod .
where@@ upon he promi@@ sed with an oa@@ th to give her whatsoever she would ask .
and she@@ , being before inst@@ ru@@ cted of her mother, said, give me here john baptist 's head in a char@@ ger .
and the king was sor@@ ry : nevertheless for the oa@@ th 's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her .
and he sen@@ t, and be@@ hea@@ ded john in the prison .
and his head was brought in a char@@ g@@ er, and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
and his disciples came, and took up the body, and bu@@ ried it, and went and told jesus .
when jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place a@@ part : and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities .
and jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick .
and when it was even@@ ing, his disciples came to him, saying, this is a desert place, and the time is now pa@@ st ; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves vi@@ c@@ tu@@ al@@ s .
but jesus said unto them, they need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
and they say unto him, we have here but five loaves, and two fishes .
he said, bring them hither to me .
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the gra@@ ss, and took the five loaves, and the two fishe@@ s, and looking up to heaven, he bles@@ sed, and bra@@ ke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude .
and they did all eat, and were filled : and they took up of the frag@@ ments that remained twelve baskets full .
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children .
and straightway jesus con@@ strained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away .
and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain a@@ part to pray : and when the even@@ ing was come, he was there alone .
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea, to@@ ssed with wa@@ ves : for the wind was contrary .
and in the four@@ th watch of the night jesus went unto them, walking on the sea .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troub@@ led, saying, it is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
but straightway jesus spake unto them, saying, be of good che@@ er ; it is i ; be not afraid .
and peter answered him and said, lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water .
and he said, come . and when peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to jesus .
but when he saw the wind bo@@ i@@ ster@@ ous, he was afraid ; and beginning to sin@@ k, he cried, saying, lord, save me .
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, o thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doub@@ t ?
and when they were come into the ship, the wind ce@@ ased .
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, of a truth thou art the son of god .
and when they were gone o@@ ver, they came into the land of gen@@ ne@@ sa@@ re@@ t .
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were dise@@ ased ;
and besought him that they might only touch the he@@ m of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfec@@ tly whole .
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees, which were of jerusalem, saying ,
why do thy disciples transgre@@ ss the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
but he answered and said unto them, why do ye also transgre@@ ss the commandment of god by your tradition ?
for god comman@@ ded, saying, honour thy father and mother : and, he that cur@@ seth father or mother, let him die the death .
but ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, it is a gif@@ t, by whatsoever thou mi@@ ght@@ est be profi@@ ted by me ;
and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of god of none e@@ ffe@@ ct by your tradition .
ye hypocri@@ tes, well did esaias prophe@@ sy of you, saying ,
this people dra@@ weth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honou@@ reth me with their li@@ ps ; but their heart is far from me .
but in va@@ in they do worship me, teaching for doctr@@ in@@ es the commandments of men .
and he called the multitude, and said unto them, hear, and understand :
not that which goeth into the mouth de@@ fi@@ leth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this de@@ fi@@ leth a man .
then came his disciples, and said unto him, knowest thou that the pharisees were offen@@ ded, after they heard this saying ?
but he answered and said, every plan@@ t, which my heavenly father hath not plan@@ ted, shall be roo@@ ted up .
let them alone : they be blind lea@@ d@@ ers of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the di@@ tch .
then answered peter and said unto him, declare unto us this parable .
and jesus said, are ye also yet without under@@ standing ?
do not ye yet under@@ st@@ and, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the be@@ l@@ ly, and is cast out into the dra@@ ught ?
but those things which proce@@ ed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they de@@ file the man .
for out of the heart proce@@ ed evil thoughts, mur@@ d@@ ers, adulter@@ i@@ es, forni@@ ca@@ tions, the@@ f@@ ts, false witness, blasphe@@ mi@@ es :
these are the things which de@@ file a man : but to eat with un@@ washe@@ n hands de@@ fi@@ leth not a man .
then jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of tyre and sid@@ on .
and, behold, a woman of can@@ a@@ an came out of the same co@@ ast@@ s, and cried unto him, saying, have mercy on me, o lord, thou son of david ; my daughter is grie@@ v@@ ously ve@@ xed with a devil .
but he answered her not a word . and his disciples came and besought him, saying, send her away ; for she cri@@ eth after us .
but he answered and said, i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel .
then came she and worshipped him, saying, lord, help me .
but he answered and said, it is not meet to take the children 's bread, and to cast it to do@@ gs .
and she said, truth, lord : yet the do@@ gs eat of the cru@@ mbs which fall from their masters ' table .
then jesus answered and said unto her, o woman, great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of galilee ; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there .
and great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were la@@ me, blind, du@@ mb, mai@@ med, and many others, and cast them down at jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
insomuch that the multitude won@@ de@@ red, when they saw the dumb to speak, the mai@@ med to be who@@ le, the lame to wal@@ k, and the blind to see : and they glorified the god of israel .
then jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, i have compassion on the multitude, because they continu@@ e with me now three days, and have nothing to eat : and i will not send them away fast@@ ing, lest they fa@@ in@@ t in the way .
and his disciples say unto him, whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fi@@ ll so great a multitude ?
and jesus saith unto them, how many loaves have ye ? and they said, se@@ ven, and a few little fishes .
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
and he took the seven loaves and the fishe@@ s, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude .
and they did all eat, and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
and they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children .
and he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of magdal@@ a .
the pharisees also with the sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
he answered and said unto them, when it is even@@ ing, ye say, it will be fa@@ ir we@@ a@@ ther : for the sk@@ y is red .
and in the mor@@ ning, it will be f@@ ou@@ l we@@ a@@ ther to day : for the sk@@ y is red and lo@@ wer@@ ing . o ye hypocri@@ tes, ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sk@@ y ; but can ye not dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times ?
a wicked and adulter@@ ous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet jonas . and he left them, and departed .
and when his disciples were come to the other side, they had for@@ gotten to take bread .
then jesus said unto them, take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
and they reasoned among themselves, saying, it is because we have taken no bread .
which when jesus percei@@ ved, he said unto them, o ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread ?
do ye not yet under@@ st@@ and, neither remember the five loaves of the five thous@@ and, and how many baskets ye took up ?
neither the seven loaves of the four thous@@ and, and how many baskets ye took up ?
how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees ?
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea phili@@ p@@ pi@@ , he asked his disciples, saying, whom do men say that i the son of man am ?
and they said, some say that thou art john the baptist : so@@ me, elias ; and others, je@@ re@@ mi@@ as, or one of the prophets .
he saith unto them, but whom say ye that i am ?
and simon peter answered and said, thou art the christ, the son of the living god .
and jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou, simon bar@@ jon@@ a : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven .
and i say also unto thee, that thou art peter, and upon this rock i will build my church ; and the ga@@ tes of hell shall not pre@@ va@@ il against it .
and i will give unto thee the ke@@ ys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ .
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be ki@@ lled, and be raised again the third day .
then peter took him, and began to rebu@@ ke him, saying, be it far from thee, lord : this shall not be unto thee .
but he turned, and said unto peter, get thee behind me, satan : thou art an off@@ ence unto me : for thou sa@@ v@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of god, but those that be of men .
then said jesus unto his disciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
for what is a man profi@@ ted, if he shall ga@@ in the whole world, and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in ex@@ chan@@ ge for his soul ?
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
verily i say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not ta@@ ste of death, till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom .
and after six days jesus taketh peter, james, and john his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain a@@ part ,
and was trans@@ fi@@ gu@@ red before them : and his face did shi@@ ne as the sun@@ , and his raiment was white as the light .
and, behold, there appeared unto them moses and elias tal@@ king with him .
then answered peter, and said unto jesus, lord, it is good for us to be here : if thou wil@@ t, let us make here three tabernac@@ les ; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias .
while he yet spake, behold, a b@@ right c@@ loud over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed them : and behold a voice out of the clou@@ d, which said, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased ; hear ye him .
and when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid .
and jesus came and touched them, and said, arise, and be not afraid .
and when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save jesus only .
and as they came down from the mountain, jesus charged them, saying, tell the vision to no man, until the son of man be risen again from the dead .
and his disciples asked him, saying, why then say the scribes that elias must first come ?
and jesus answered and said unto them, elias truly shall first come, and re@@ stor@@ e all things .
but i say unto you, that elias is come al@@ ready, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they li@@ sted . likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them .
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist .
and when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, knee@@ ling down to him, and saying ,
lord, have mercy on my son : for he is l@@ un@@ a@@ ti@@ ck, and sore ve@@ xed : for of@@ t@@ times he fal@@ leth into the fire, and of@@ t into the water .
and i brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cu@@ re him .
then jesus answered and said, o faith@@ less and perver@@ se generation, how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
and jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cu@@ red from that very hour .
then came the disciples to jesus a@@ par@@ t, and said, why could not we cast him out ?
and jesus said unto them, because of your unbelie@@ f : for verily i say unto you, if ye have faith as a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, re@@ move hence to yon@@ der place ; and it shall re@@ move ; and nothing shall be im@@ possible unto you .
howbeit this k@@ ind goeth not out but by prayer and fa@@ sting .
and while they abode in galilee, jesus said unto them, the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sor@@ ry .
and when they were come to capernaum, they that received tribute money came to peter, and said, doth not your master pay tribute ?
he saith, yes . and when he was come into the house, jesus pre@@ ven@@ ted him, saying, what thin@@ kest thou, simon ? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? of their own children, or of strangers ?
peter saith unto him, of strangers . jesus saith unto him, then are the children free .
notwith@@ standing, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an ho@@ o@@ k, and take up the fi@@ sh that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money : that ta@@ ke, and give unto them for me and thee .
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus, saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them ,
and said, verily i say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
whosoever therefore shall hu@@ mb@@ le himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mi@@ ll@@ stone were hanged about his ne@@ ck, and that he were d@@ row@@ ned in the de@@ p@@ th of the sea .
woe unto the world because of offen@@ ces ! for it must needs be that offen@@ ces come ; but woe to that man by whom the off@@ ence cometh !
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life ha@@ lt or mai@@ med, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
and if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye despi@@ se not one of these little ones ; for i say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven .
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone ast@@ ra@@ y, doth he not leave the nine@@ ty and nin@@ e, and goeth into the moun@@ tains, and seeketh that which is gone ast@@ ra@@ y ?
and if so be that he find it, verily i say unto you, he rejoi@@ ce@@ th more of that sheep, than of the nine@@ ty and n@@ ine which went not ast@@ ra@@ y .
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish .
moreover if thy brother shall trespas@@ s against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother .
but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be esta@@ bli@@ shed .
and if he shall ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct to hear them, tell it unto the church : but if he ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an hea@@ then man and a publi@@ can .
verily i say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
again i say unto you, that if two of you shall agre@@ e on earth as touching any thing that they shall as@@ k, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven .
for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am i in the midst of them .
then came peter to him, and said, lord, how of@@ t shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him ? till seven times ?
jesus saith unto him, i say not unto thee, until seven times : but, until se@@ ven@@ ty times seven .
therefore is the kingdom of heaven li@@ k@@ ened unto a certain king, which would take ac@@ coun@@ t of his servants .
and when he had be@@ gu@@ n to re@@ ck@@ on, one was brought unto him, which o@@ wed him ten thousand talents .
but forasmuch as he had not to pa@@ y, his lord commanded him to be so@@ ld, and his wife, and children, and all that he ha@@ d, and pa@@ y@@ ment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, lord, have pa@@ ti@@ ence with me, and i will pay thee all .
then the lord of that servant was moved with compas@@ sion, and loosed him, and for@@ gave him the deb@@ t .
but the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow@@ servants, which o@@ wed him an hundred pen@@ ce : and he laid hands on him, and took him by the th@@ ro@@ at, saying, pay me that thou o@@ west .
and his fellow@@ servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, have pa@@ ti@@ ence with me, and i will pay thee all .
and he would not : but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the deb@@ t .
so when his fellow@@ servants saw what was done, they were very sor@@ ry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, o thou wicked servant, i for@@ gave thee all that deb@@ t, because thou desi@@ re@@ dst me :
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow@@ servant, even as i had pi@@ ty on thee ?
and his lord was wro@@ th, and delivered him to the tor@@ men@@ tor@@ s, till he should pay all that was du@@ e unto him .
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespas@@ ses .
and it came to pass, that when jesus had fin@@ ished these sayings, he departed from galilee, and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan ;
and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
the pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
and he answered and said unto them, have ye not rea@@ d, that he which made them at the beginning made them ma@@ le and fe@@ ma@@ le ,
and said, for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall c@@ leave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
wherefore they are no more twa@@ in, but one flesh . what therefore god hath jo@@ ined together, let not man put as@@ under .
they say unto him, why did moses then command to give a writing of di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ ment, and to put her away ?
he saith unto them, moses because of the har@@ dness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wi@@ ves : but from the beginning it was not so .
and i say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for forni@@ ca@@ tion, and shall mar@@ ry another, committeth adultery : and whoso marri@@ eth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
his disciples say unto him, if the ca@@ se of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to mar@@ ry .
but he said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given .
for there are some eunu@@ ch@@ s, which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunu@@ ch@@ s, which were made eunu@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be eunu@@ ch@@ s, which have made themselves eunu@@ ch@@ s for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it, let him receive it .
then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
but jesus said, suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
and he laid his hands on them, and departed thence .
and, behold, one came and said unto him, good master, what good thing shall i do, that i may have eternal life ?
and he said unto him, why cal@@ lest thou me good ? there is none good but one, that is, god : but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments .
he saith unto him, which ? jesus said, thou shalt do no mur@@ d@@ er, thou shalt not commit adulter@@ y, thou shalt not ste@@ al, thou shalt not bear false witness ,
honour thy father and thy mother : and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
the young man saith unto him, all these things have i kept from my you@@ th up : what la@@ ck i yet ?
jesus said unto him, if thou wilt be perfec@@ t, go and se@@ ll that thou ha@@ st, and give to the po@@ or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
but when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrow@@ ful : for he had great posses@@ sions .
then said jesus unto his disciples, verily i say unto you, that a rich man shall har@@ dly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
and again i say unto you, it is easi@@ er for a ca@@ mel to go through the eye of a nee@@ dle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
when his disciples heard it, they were excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly amazed, saying, who then can be saved ?
but jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is im@@ possible ; but with god all things are possible .
then answered peter and said unto him, behold, we have for@@ sa@@ ken all, and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
and jesus said unto them, verily i say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the re@@ generation when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thr@@ on@@ es, judg@@ ing the twelve tri@@ bes of israel .
and every one that hath for@@ sa@@ ken houses, or brethren, or si@@ st@@ ers, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or l@@ and@@ s, for my name 's sake, shall receive an hundre@@ d@@ fold, and shall inherit everlasting life .
but many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an househo@@ ld@@ er, which went out early in the morning to hi@@ re labourers into his vineyard .
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard .
and he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing i@@ dle in the marke@@ t@@ place ,
and said unto them ; go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right i will give you . and they went their way .
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise .
and about the ele@@ ven@@ th hour he went out, and found others standing i@@ dle, and saith unto them, why stand ye here all the day i@@ dle ?
they say unto him, because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them, go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is ri@@ ght, that shall ye receive .
so when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his ste@@ ward, call the labou@@ re@@ rs, and give them their hi@@ re, beginning from the last unto the first .
and when they came that were hired about the ele@@ ven@@ th hour, they received every man a penny .
but when the first came, they suppo@@ sed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
and when they had received it, they murmured against the goo@@ d@@ man of the house ,
saying, these last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them e@@ qu@@ al unto us, which have bor@@ ne the bur@@ den and he@@ at of the day .
but he answered one of them, and said, friend, i do thee no wr@@ ong : didst not thou agre@@ e with me for a penny ?
take that thine is, and go thy way : i will give unto this la@@ st, even as unto thee .
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own ? is thine eye evil, because i am good ?
so the last shall be first, and the first last : for many be called, but few chosen .
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples a@@ part in the way, and said unto them ,
behold, we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death ,
and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mo@@ ck, and to scour@@ ge, and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
then came to him the mother of zebede@@ es children with her s@@ ons, worshi@@ pp@@ ing him, and desiring a certain thing of him .
and he said unto her, what wilt thou ? she saith unto him, gran@@ t that these my two sons may si@@ t, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the le@@ f@@ t, in thy kingdom .
but jesus answered and said, ye know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ? they say unto him, we are able .
and he saith unto them, ye shall drink indeed of my c@@ up, and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand, and on my le@@ f@@ t, is not mine to gi@@ ve, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father .
and when the ten heard it, they were moved with indi@@ g@@ nation against the two brethren .
but jesus called them unto him, and said, ye know that the prin@@ ces of the gentiles exercise do@@ mini@@ on over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
but it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister ;
and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant :
even as the son of man came not to be ministered un@@ to@@ , but to mini@@ ster, and to give his life a ran@@ som for many .
and as they departed from jeri@@ cho@@ , a great multitude followed him .
and, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that jesus passed by, cried out, saying, have mercy on us, o lord, thou son of david .
and the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more, saying, have mercy on us, o lord, thou son of david .
and jesus stood sti@@ ll, and called them, and said, what will ye that i shall do unto you ?
they say unto him, lord, that our eyes may be opened .
so jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him .
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem, and were come to beth@@ pha@@ ge, unto the mount of oli@@ ves, then sent jesus two disciples ,
saying unto them, go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an as@@ s ti@@ ed, and a colt with her : loose them, and bring them unto me .
and if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, the lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying ,
tell ye the daughter of sion, behold, thy king cometh unto thee, me@@ ek, and sitting upon an as@@ s, and a colt the fo@@ al of an as@@ s .
and the disciples went, and did as jesus commanded them ,
and brought the as@@ s, and the co@@ lt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon .
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the tre@@ es, and stra@@ wed them in the way .
and the multitudes that went be@@ fore, and that follo@@ wed, cried, saying, hosanna to the son of david : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord ; hosanna in the highest .
and when he was come into jerusalem, all the city was mo@@ ved, saying, who is this ?
and the multitude said, this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee .
and jesus went into the temple of god, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and over@@ threw the ta@@ b@@ les of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ g@@ ers, and the seats of them that sold do@@ ves ,
and said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wond@@ er@@ ful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, hosanna to the son of david ; they were sore disp@@ leased ,
and said unto him, hea@@ rest thou what these say ? and jesus saith unto them, ye@@ a ; have ye never rea@@ d, out of the mouth of ba@@ bes and su@@ ck@@ l@@ ings thou hast perfe@@ cted praise ?
and he left them, and went out of the city into beth@@ any ; and he lodged there .
now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hun@@ ge@@ red .
and when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing there@@ on, but lea@@ ves only, and said unto it, let no fruit g@@ row on thee hence@@ for@@ ward for ever . and presen@@ tly the fig tree withered away .
and when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, how soon is the fig tree withered away !
jesus answered and said unto them, verily i say unto you, if ye have faith, and doub@@ t not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, be thou re@@ mo@@ ved, and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
and all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in pray@@ er, belie@@ v@@ ing, ye shall receive .
and when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was tea@@ chi@@ ng, and said, by what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
and jesus answered and said unto them, i also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things .
the baptism of john, whence was it ? from heaven, or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven ; he will say unto us, why did ye not then believe him ?
but if we shall say, of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold john as a prophet .
and they answered jesus, and said, we cannot tell . and he said unto them, neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
but what think ye ? a certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first, and said, son, go work to day in my vineyard .
he answered and said, i will not : but afterward he rep@@ ente@@ d, and went .
and he came to the secon@@ d, and said likewise . and he answered and said, i go, si@@ r : and went not .
whether of them twain did the will of his father ? they say unto him, the first . jesus saith unto them, verily i say unto you, that the publicans and the har@@ lots go into the kingdom of god before you .
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the har@@ lots believed him : and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not after@@ ward, that ye might believe him .
hear another parable : there was a certain househo@@ ld@@ er, which plan@@ ted a vineyard, and he@@ d@@ ged it round about, and di@@ g@@ ged a win@@ e@@ pre@@ ss in it, and built a to@@ wer@@ , and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country :
and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it .
and the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another .
again, he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
but last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, they will reve@@ re@@ nce my son .
but when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, this is the he@@ ir ; come, let us kill him, and let us se@@ i@@ z@@ e on his inheritance .
and they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him .
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
they say unto him, he will mi@@ ser@@ ab@@ ly destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall ren@@ der him the fruits in their seas@@ ons .
jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptu@@ res, the stone which the build@@ ers reje@@ c@@ ted, the same is become the head of the cor@@ ner : this is the lord 's do@@ ing, and it is marve@@ ll@@ ous in our eyes ?
therefore say i unto you, the kingdom of god shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bring@@ ing forth the fruits thereof .
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fal@@ l, it will gr@@ ind him to po@@ w@@ der .
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them .
but when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet .
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said ,
the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son ,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
again, he sent forth other servants, saying, tell them which are bid@@ d@@ en, behold, i have prepared my d@@ in@@ ner : my o@@ x@@ en and my fa@@ t@@ l@@ ings are ki@@ lled, and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
but they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his far@@ m, another to his mer@@ chan@@ di@@ se :
and the re@@ m@@ n@@ ant took his servants, and en@@ trea@@ ted them spi@@ te@@ ful@@ ly, and slew them .
but when the king heard thereof, he was wro@@ th : and he sent forth his ar@@ mi@@ es, and destro@@ yed those murde@@ re@@ rs, and bur@@ ned up their city .
then saith he to his servants, the wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy .
go ye therefore into the high@@ ways, and as many as ye shall fin@@ d, bid to the marriage .
so those servants went out into the high@@ ways, and gathered together all as many as they f@@ ound, both ba@@ d and good : and the wedding was fur@@ ni@@ shed with gu@@ es@@ ts .
and when the king came in to see the gu@@ es@@ ts, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
and he saith unto him, friend, how ca@@ m@@ est thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? and he was spee@@ ch@@ less .
then said the king to the servants, bind him hand and foo@@ t, and take him away, and cast him into ou@@ ter dark@@ ness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
for many are called, but few are chosen .
then went the pharisees, and took counsel how they might en@@ tan@@ g@@ le him in his tal@@ k .
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodi@@ ans, saying, master, we know that thou art true, and teac@@ hest the way of god in truth, neither ca@@ rest thou for any man : for thou regar@@ dest not the per@@ son of men .
tell us therefore, what thin@@ kest thou ? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar, or not ?
but jesus perceived their wi@@ c@@ ke@@ d@@ ness, and said, why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites ?
shew me the tribute money . and they brought unto him a penny .
and he saith unto them, whose is this image and super@@ scrip@@ tion ?
they say unto him, caesar 's . then saith he unto them, ren@@ der therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar 's ; and unto god the things that are god 's .
when they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way .
the same day came to him the sadduce@@ es, which say that there is no resurre@@ ction, and asked him ,
saying, master, moses said, if a man die, having no children, his brother shall mar@@ ry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first, when he had mar@@ ried a wife, de@@ cea@@ sed, and, having no is@@ su@@ e, left his wife unto his brother :
likewise the second also, and the thir@@ d, unto the se@@ ven@@ th .
and last of all the woman died also .
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
jesus answered and said unto them, ye do er@@ r, not knowing the scriptu@@ res, nor the power of god .
for in the resurrection they neither mar@@ ry, nor are given in marri@@ a@@ ge, but are as the angels of god in heaven .
but as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god, saying ,
i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob ? god is not the god of the dead, but of the living .
and when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine .
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to sil@@ en@@ ce, they were gathered together .
then one of them, which was a lawy@@ er, asked him a ques@@ tion, tempting him, and saying ,
master, which is the great commandment in the law ?
jesus said unto him, thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind .
this is the first and great commandment .
and the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
on these two commandments han@@ g all the law and the prophets .
while the pharisees were gathered together, jesus asked them ,
saying, what think ye of christ ? whose son is he ? they say unto him, the son of david .
he saith unto them, how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying ,
the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemi@@ es thy foo@@ tstool ?
if david then call him lord, how is he his son ?
and no man was able to answer him a word, neither du@@ rst any man from that day forth ask him any more questi@@ ons .
then spake jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples ,
saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses ' seat :
all therefore whatsoever they bid you ob@@ ser@@ ve, that ob@@ serve and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say, and do not .
for they bind heavy bur@@ den@@ s and grie@@ v@@ ous to be bor@@ n@@ e, and lay them on men 's shou@@ ld@@ ers ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fing@@ ers .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make bro@@ ad their phy@@ la@@ c@@ ter@@ i@@ es, and en@@ l@@ ar@@ ge the bor@@ d@@ ers of their garments ,
and love the up@@ per@@ most roo@@ ms at fea@@ st@@ s, and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
and gree@@ t@@ ings in the marke@@ ts, and to be called of men, rabbi, rab@@ b@@ i .
but be not ye called rab@@ b@@ i : for one is your master, even christ ; and all ye are brethren .
and call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your father, which is in heaven .
neither be ye called masters : for one is your master, even christ .
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
and whosoever shall exal@@ t himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that shall hu@@ mb@@ le himself shall be exalted .
but woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye dev@@ our widows ' houses, and for a pre@@ t@@ ence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater dam@@ nation .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye com@@ pass sea and land to make one pro@@ sel@@ y@@ te, and when he is ma@@ de, ye make him t@@ wo@@ fold more the child of hell than yourselves .
woe unto you, ye blind gui@@ des, which say, whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the go@@ ld of the temple, he is a deb@@ t@@ or !
ye foo@@ ls and blind : for whether is grea@@ ter, the go@@ ld, or the temple that sancti@@ fi@@ eth the go@@ ld ?
and, whosoever shall swear by the al@@ tar@@ , it is nothing ; but whosoever swe@@ a@@ reth by the gift that is upon it, he is gui@@ l@@ ty .
ye foo@@ ls and blind : for whether is grea@@ ter, the gif@@ t, or the al@@ ta@@ r that sancti@@ fi@@ eth the gift ?
whoso therefore shall swear by the al@@ tar@@ , swe@@ a@@ reth by it, and by all things thereon .
and whoso shall swear by the temple, swe@@ a@@ reth by it, and by him that dwel@@ leth therein .
and he that shall swear by heaven, swe@@ a@@ reth by the throne of god, and by him that si@@ tteth thereon .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye pay ti@@ the of min@@ t and ani@@ se and cum@@ min@@ , and have o@@ mi@@ tted the we@@ igh@@ ti@@ er mat@@ ters of the law, judgment, mer@@ c@@ y, and faith : these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other un@@ done .
ye blind gui@@ des, which stra@@ in at a g@@ na@@ t, and s@@ wal@@ low a ca@@ mel .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye make clean the out@@ side of the cup and of the pla@@ t@@ ter, but within they are full of ex@@ tor@@ tion and ex@@ c@@ ess .
thou blind pharise@@ e, clean@@ se first that which is within the cup and pla@@ t@@ ter, that the out@@ side of them may be clean also .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whi@@ ted sepulch@@ res, which indeed appear be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful ou@@ tw@@ ard, but are within full of dead men 's bon@@ es, and of all un@@ clean@@ ness .
even so ye also ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocri@@ sy and iniquity .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! because ye build the to@@ mbs of the prophets, and gar@@ n@@ ish the sepulch@@ res of the righteous ,
and say, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been par@@ ta@@ k@@ ers with them in the blood of the prophets .
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
fi@@ ll ye up then the measure of your fathers .
ye ser@@ pen@@ ts, ye generation of vi@@ pers, how can ye es@@ cap@@ e the dam@@ nation of hell ?
where@@ fore, behold, i send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city :
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous a@@ be@@ l unto the blood of zacharias son of bar@@ a@@ chi@@ as, whom ye slew between the temple and the al@@ ta@@ r .
verily i say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation .
o jerusalem, jerusalem, thou that ki@@ l@@ lest the prophets, and ston@@ est them which are sent unto thee, how of@@ ten would i have gathered thy children together, even as a he@@ n ga@@ there@@ th her chi@@ ck@@ en@@ s under her w@@ ings, and ye would not !
behold, your house is left unto you deso@@ la@@ te .
for i say unto you, ye shall not see me hence@@ forth, till ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
and jesus went out, and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the build@@ ings of the temple .
and jesus said unto them, see ye not all these things ? verily i say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be th@@ ro@@ wn down .
and as he sat upon the mount of oli@@ ves, the disciples came unto him private@@ ly, saying, tell us, when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world ?
and jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man decei@@ ve you .
for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ ; and shall decei@@ ve many .
and ye shall hear of war@@ s and ru@@ mour@@ s of war@@ s : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet .
for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be fa@@ min@@ es, and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ces, and earth@@ qua@@ k@@ es, in divers pla@@ ces .
all these are the beginning of sorrow@@ s .
then shall they deliver you up to be affli@@ c@@ ted, and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
and then shall many be offen@@ ded, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another .
and many false prophets shall rise, and shall decei@@ ve many .
and because iniquity shall ab@@ ound, the love of many shall wa@@ x co@@ ld .
but he that shall en@@ du@@ re unto the en@@ d, the same shall be saved .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the abo@@ min@@ ation of deso@@ la@@ tion, spoken of by d@@ ani@@ el the prophet, stand in the holy place, 
then let them which be in judaea flee into the moun@@ tains :
let him which is on the house@@ top not come down to take any thing out of his house :
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
and woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give su@@ ck in those days !
but pray ye that your f@@ light be not in the win@@ ter, neither on the sabbath day :
for then shall be great tribu@@ la@@ tion, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be .
and except those days should be shor@@ ten@@ ed, there should no flesh be saved : but for the ele@@ ct 's sake those days shall be shor@@ t@@ ened .
then if any man shall say unto you, lo, here is christ, or there ; believe it not .
for there shall arise false chri@@ st@@ s, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall decei@@ ve the very ele@@ ct .
behold, i have told you before .
wherefore if they shall say unto you, behold, he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold, he is in the secret cha@@ mb@@ ers ; believe it not .
for as the light@@ ning cometh out of the ea@@ st, and shi@@ ne@@ th even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
for wheresoever the car@@ ca@@ se is, there will the ea@@ g@@ les be gathered together .
immediately after the tribu@@ lation of those days shall the sun be dark@@ en@@ ed, and the mo@@ on shall not give her light, and the star@@ s shall fall from heaven, and the power@@ s of the heavens shall be shaken :
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tri@@ bes of the earth mour@@ n, and they shall see the son of man coming in the clou@@ ds of heaven with power and great glory .
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t, and they shall gather together his ele@@ ct from the four win@@ ds, from one end of heaven to the other .
now lear@@ n a parable of the fig tree ; when his bran@@ ch is yet ten@@ d@@ er, and putteth forth lea@@ ves, ye know that su@@ m@@ me@@ r is nigh :
so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors .
verily i say unto you, this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled .
heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away .
but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my father only .
but as the days of no@@ e we@@ re, so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
for as in the days that were before the f@@ lood they were ea@@ ting and drin@@ king, mar@@ rying and gi@@ ving in marri@@ a@@ ge, until the day that no@@ e entered into the ar@@ k ,
and knew not until the f@@ lood came, and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken, and the other left .
two women shall be g@@ rin@@ ding at the mi@@ ll ; the one shall be taken, and the other left .
watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your lord doth come .
but know this, that if the goo@@ d@@ man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have wat@@ che@@ d, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh .
who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his househo@@ ld, to give them meat in du@@ e season ?
blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do@@ ing .
verily i say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my lord de@@ la@@ yeth his coming ;
and shall begin to smite his fellow@@ servants, and to eat and drink with the drun@@ ken ;
the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he loo@@ keth not for him, and in an hour that he is not a@@ ware of ,
and shall cut him as@@ und@@ er, and appoin@@ t him his por@@ tion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be li@@ k@@ ened unto ten virg@@ in@@ s, which took their la@@ mp@@ s, and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
and five of them were wise, and five were foo@@ li@@ sh .
they that were foo@@ li@@ sh took their la@@ mp@@ s, and took no oil with them :
but the wise took oil in their ves@@ sel@@ s with their la@@ mp@@ s .
while the bridegroom tar@@ ri@@ ed, they all s@@ lu@@ mbered and sle@@ pt .
and at mid@@ night there was a c@@ ry ma@@ de, behold, the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
then all those virg@@ ins arose, and tri@@ m@@ med their la@@ mp@@ s .
and the foo@@ li@@ sh said unto the wise, give us of your oil ; for our la@@ mp@@ s are gone out .
but the wise answered, saying, not so ; lest there be not en@@ ough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sel@@ l, and buy for yourselves .
and while they went to bu@@ y, the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
afterward came also the other virg@@ in@@ s, saying, lord, lord, open to us .
but he answered and said, verily i say unto you, i know you not .
watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh .
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man tra@@ ve@@ l@@ ling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods .
and unto one he gave five talen@@ ts, to another t@@ wo@@ , and to another one ; to every man according to his se@@ ver@@ al abi@@ li@@ ty ; and straightway took his journe@@ y .
then he that had received the five talents went and tra@@ ded with the sa@@ me, and made them other five talents .
and likewise he that had received t@@ wo@@ , he also gained other two .
but he that had received one went and di@@ g@@ ged in the earth, and hid his lord 's money .
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and re@@ ck@@ on@@ eth with them .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talen@@ ts, saying, lord, thou deli@@ ve@@ re@@ dst unto me five talents : behold, i have gained beside them five talents more .
his lord said unto him, well done, thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things, i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
he also that had received two talents came and said, lord, thou deli@@ ve@@ re@@ dst unto me two talents : behold, i have gained two other talents beside them .
his lord said unto him, well done, good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things, i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
then he which had received the one tal@@ ent came and said, lord, i knew thee that thou art an hard man, rea@@ p@@ ing where thou hast not so@@ w@@ n, and ga@@ ther@@ ing where thou hast not stra@@ wed :
and i was afrai@@ d, and went and hid thy tal@@ ent in the earth : lo, there thou hast that is thine .
his lord answered and said unto him, thou wicked and s@@ lo@@ th@@ ful servant, thou kne@@ west that i rea@@ p where i so@@ wed not, and gather where i have not stra@@ wed :
thou ou@@ ght@@ est therefore to have put my money to the ex@@ chan@@ g@@ ers, and then at my coming i should have received mine own with u@@ su@@ ry .
take therefore the tal@@ ent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
for unto every one that hath shall be gi@@ ven, and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
and cast ye the un@@ profi@@ table servant into ou@@ ter darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
when the son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall se@@ para@@ te them one from another, as a shepherd divi@@ deth his sheep from the go@@ a@@ ts :
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the go@@ a@@ ts on the left .
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda@@ tion of the world :
for i was an hungred, and ye gave me meat : i was thir@@ st@@ y, and ye gave me drink : i was a strang@@ er, and ye took me in :
na@@ ked, and ye clothed me : i was sick, and ye visi@@ ted me : i was in prison, and ye came unto me .
then shall the righteous answer him, saying, lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and f@@ ed thee ? or thir@@ st@@ y, and gave thee drink ?
when saw we thee a strang@@ er, and took thee in ? or na@@ ked, and clothed thee ?
or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee ?
and the king shall answer and say unto them, verily i say unto you, in@@ asmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me .
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, depart from me, ye cur@@ sed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels :
for i was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat : i was thir@@ st@@ y, and ye gave me no drink :
i was a strang@@ er, and ye took me not in : na@@ ked, and ye clothed me not : sick, and in prison, and ye visi@@ ted me not .
then shall they also answer him, saying, lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or a@@ thir@@ st, or a strang@@ er, or na@@ ked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee ?
then shall he answer them, saying, verily i say unto you, in@@ asmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of the@@ se, ye did it not to me .
and these shall go away into everlasting p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment : but the righteous into life eternal .
and it came to pass, when jesus had fin@@ ished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples ,
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the pala@@ ce of the high priest, who was called caiapha@@ s ,
and cons@@ ul@@ ted that they might take jesus by sub@@ ti@@ l@@ ty, and kill him .
but they said, not on the feast day, lest there be an upro@@ ar among the people .
now when jesus was in bethany, in the house of simon the le@@ per ,
there came unto him a woman having an a@@ lab@@ as@@ ter bo@@ x of very pre@@ ci@@ ous oint@@ ment, and p@@ oured it on his head, as he sat at meat .
but when his disciples saw it, they had indi@@ g@@ nation, saying, to what purpo@@ se is this wa@@ ste ?
for this ointment might have been sold for mu@@ ch, and given to the poor .
when jesus understood it, he said unto them, why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
for ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
for in that she hath p@@ oured this ointment on my body, she did it for my bu@@ ri@@ al .
verily i say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a me@@ mor@@ i@@ al of her .
then one of the twelve, called judas iscariot, went unto the chief priests ,
and said unto them, what will ye give me, and i will deliver him unto you ? and they co@@ ven@@ an@@ ted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
and from that time he sought op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to betray him .
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus, saying unto him, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
and he said, go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, the master saith, my time is at hand ; i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve .
and as they did eat, he said, verily i say unto you, that one of you shall betray me .
and they were exceeding sorrow@@ ful, and began every one of them to say unto him, lord, is it i ?
and he answered and said, he that di@@ p@@ peth his hand with me in the dis@@ h, the same shall betray me .
the son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
then judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, master, is it i ? he said unto him, thou hast said .
and as they were ea@@ t@@ ing, jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, ta@@ ke, eat ; this is my body .
and he took the c@@ up, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, drink ye all of it ;
for this is my blood of the new t@@ esta@@ ment, which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
but i say unto you, i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vin@@ e, until that day when i drink it new with you in my father 's kingdom .
and when they had sun@@ g an hy@@ m@@ n, they went out into the mount of olives .
then saith jesus unto them, all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written, i will smite the shepher@@ d, and the sheep of the flo@@ ck shall be scattered abroad .
but after i am risen again, i will go before you into galilee .
peter answered and said unto him, though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will i never be offended .
jesus said unto him, verily i say unto thee, that this night, before the cock cro@@ w, thou shalt deny me thrice .
peter said unto him, though i should die with thee, yet will i not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called ge@@ th@@ se@@ man@@ e, and saith unto the disciples, sit ye here, while i go and pray yon@@ der .
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee, and began to be sorrow@@ ful and very heavy .
then saith he unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrow@@ ful, even unto death : tarry ye here, and watch with me .
and he went a little far@@ ther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, o my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as i will, but as thou wilt .
and he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asle@@ ep, and saith unto peter, wha@@ t, could ye not watch with me one hour ?
watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is wil@@ ling, but the flesh is we@@ a@@ k .
he went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, o my father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except i drink it, thy will be done .
and he came and found them asle@@ ep again : for their eyes were heavy .
and he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words .
then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest : behold, the hour is at hand, and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
rise, let us be going : behold, he is at hand that doth betray me .
and while he yet spake, lo, judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and sta@@ ves, from the chief priests and elders of the people .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sig@@ n, saying, whomsoever i shall kis@@ s, that same is he : hold him fast .
and forthwith he came to jesus, and said, hai@@ l, master ; and kis@@ sed him .
and jesus said unto him, friend, wherefore art thou come ? then came they, and laid hands on jesus and took him .
and, behold, one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his s@@ word, and st@@ ru@@ ck a servant of the high priest 's, and smote off his ear .
then said jesus unto him, put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
thin@@ kest thou that i cannot now pray to my father, and he shall presen@@ tly give me more than twelve le@@ gi@@ ons of angels ?
but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be ?
in that same hour said jesus to the multitu@@ des, are ye come out as against a thief with swords and sta@@ ves for to take me ? i sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me .
but all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples for@@ so@@ ok him, and fled .
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiapha@@ s the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priest 's pala@@ ce, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end .
now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against jesus, to put him to death ;
but found none : yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none . at the last came two false witnesses ,
and said, this fellow said, i am able to destroy the temple of god, and to build it in three days .
and the high priest arose, and said unto him, answe@@ rest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but jesus held his peace, and the high priest answered and said unto him, i ad@@ ju@@ re thee by the living god, that thou tell us whether thou be the christ, the son of god .
jesus saith unto him, thou hast said : nevertheless i say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clou@@ ds of heaven .
then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, he hath spoken blasphe@@ my ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold, now ye have heard his blasphe@@ my .
what think ye ? they answered and said, he is gui@@ l@@ ty of death .
then did they spit in his face, and bu@@ ffe@@ ted him ; and others smote him with the pal@@ ms of their hands ,
saying, prophe@@ sy unto us, thou christ, who is he that smote thee ?
now peter sat without in the pala@@ ce : and a damsel came unto him, saying, thou also wa@@ st with jesus of galilee .
but he denied before them all, saying, i know not what thou sayest .
and when he was gone out into the por@@ ch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth .
and again he denied with an oa@@ th, i do not know the man .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to peter, sure@@ ly thou also art one of them ; for thy speech be@@ wra@@ yeth thee .
then began he to cur@@ se and to swe@@ ar, saying, i know not the man . and immediately the cock cre@@ w .
and peter remembered the word of jesus, which said unto him, before the cock cro@@ w, thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out, and wept bi@@ tter@@ ly .
when the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death :
and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to pon@@ ti@@ us pilate the governor .
then judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condem@@ ned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying, i have sin@@ ned in that i have betrayed the in@@ no@@ c@@ ent blood . and they said, what is that to us ? see thou to that .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself .
and the chief priests took the silver pie@@ ces, and said, it is not lawful for to put them into the treasu@@ ry, because it is the pri@@ ce of blood .
and they took coun@@ sel@@ , and bought with them the po@@ tter 's field, to bu@@ ry strangers in .
wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day .
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by je@@ re@@ my the prophet, saying, and they took the thirty pieces of sil@@ ver, the pri@@ ce of him that was v@@ al@@ u@@ ed, whom they of the children of israel did v@@ al@@ u@@ e ;
and gave them for the po@@ tter 's field, as the lord appointed me .
and jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him, saying, art thou the king of the jews ? and jesus said unto him, thou sayest .
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing .
then said pilate unto him, hea@@ rest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
and he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
now at that feast the governor was won@@ t to release unto the people a prison@@ er, whom they would .
and they had then a no@@ table prison@@ er, called barabbas .
therefore when they were gathered together, pilate said unto them, whom will ye that i release unto you ? barab@@ bas, or jesus which is called christ ?
for he knew that for en@@ v@@ y they had delivered him .
when he was set down on the judgment se@@ at, his wife sent unto him, saying, have thou nothing to do with that just man : for i have suffered many things this day in a drea@@ m because of him .
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barab@@ bas, and destroy jesus .
the governor answered and said unto them, whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you ? they said, barabbas .
pilate saith unto them, what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ ? they all say unto him, let him be crucified .
and the governor said, wh@@ y, what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more, saying, let him be crucified .
when pilate saw that he could pre@@ va@@ il no@@ thing, but that rather a tu@@ mul@@ t was ma@@ de, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, i am in@@ no@@ c@@ ent of the blood of this just per@@ son : see ye to it .
then answered all the people, and said, his blood be on us, and on our children .
then re@@ leased he barabbas unto them : and when he had scour@@ ged jesus, he delivered him to be crucified .
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common ha@@ ll, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
and they stri@@ pped him, and put on him a s@@ car@@ let ro@@ be .
and when they had pla@@ tted a cro@@ wn of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a re@@ ed in his right hand : and they bo@@ wed the kne@@ e before him, and mocked him, saying, hai@@ l, king of the jews !
and they spit upon him, and took the re@@ ed, and smote him on the head .
and after that they had mocked him, they took the ro@@ be off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him .
and as they came out, they found a man of cy@@ ren@@ e, simon by name : him they com@@ pe@@ lled to bear his cross .
and when they were come unto a place called go@@ l@@ go@@ tha, that is to say, a place of a sk@@ u@@ ll ,
they gave him vine@@ ga@@ r to drink m@@ ing@@ led with ga@@ ll : and when he had ta@@ sted thereof, he would not drink .
and they crucified him, and parted his gar@@ ments, casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, they parted my garments among them, and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
and sitting down they watched him there ;
and set up over his head his accu@@ sa@@ tion written, this is jesus the king of the jews .
then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left .
and they that passed by re@@ vi@@ led him, wa@@ g@@ ging their hea@@ ds ,
and saying, thou that destro@@ yest the temple, and bui@@ ldest it in three days, save thyself . if thou be the son of god, come down from the cross .
likewise also the chief priests mo@@ c@@ king him, with the scribes and elders, said ,
he saved others ; himself he cannot save . if he be the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him .
he tru@@ sted in god ; let him deliver him now, if he will have him : for he said, i am the son of god .
the thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eli@@ , eli@@ , la@@ m@@ a sa@@ ba@@ ch@@ than@@ i ? that is to say, my god, my god, why hast thou for@@ sa@@ ken me ?
some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, this man calleth for elias .
and straightway one of them ran@@ , and took a sp@@ un@@ ge, and filled it with vine@@ gar@@ , and put it on a re@@ ed, and gave him to drink .
the rest said, let be, let us see whether elias will come to save him .
jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, y@@ i@@ eld@@ ed up the ghost .
and, behold, the ve@@ il of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m ; and the earth did qua@@ ke, and the ro@@ c@@ ks rent ;
and the gra@@ ves were opened ; and many bo@@ di@@ es of the sa@@ ints which sle@@ pt arose ,
and came out of the gra@@ ves after his resurre@@ ction, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many .
now when the centurion, and they that were with him, wat@@ ching jesus, saw the earth@@ qua@@ ke, and those things that were done, they feared grea@@ tly, saying, truly this was the son of god .
and many women were there beholding afar off, which followed jesus from galilee, mini@@ st@@ ering unto him :
among which was mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james and jo@@ ses, and the mother of zebede@@ es children .
when the even was come, there came a rich man of ari@@ ma@@ tha@@ e@@ a, named joseph, who also himself was jesus ' disciple :
he went to pilate, and beg@@ ged the body of jesus . then pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
and when joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen clo@@ th ,
and laid it in his own new to@@ mb, which he had hewn out in the rock : and he ro@@ lled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed .
and there was mary magdalene, and the other mary, sitting over against the sepulchre .
now the next day, that followed the day of the pre@@ para@@ tion, the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate ,
saying, sir, we remember that that decei@@ ver said, while he was yet a@@ li@@ ve, after three days i will rise again .
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and ste@@ al him away, and say unto the people, he is risen from the dead : so the last er@@ ror shall be worse than the first .
pilate said unto them, ye have a watch : go your way, make it as sure as ye can .
so they went, and made the sepulchre su@@ re, se@@ al@@ ing the st@@ one, and se@@ tting a watch .
in the end of the sabba@@ th, as it began to da@@ wn toward the first day of the week, came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre .
and, behold, there was a great earth@@ qua@@ ke : for the angel of the lord descen@@ ded from heaven, and came and ro@@ lled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it .
his coun@@ ten@@ ance was like light@@ ning, and his raiment white as s@@ now :
and for fear of him the kee@@ pers did sha@@ ke, and be@@ came as dead men .
and the angel answered and said unto the women, fear not ye : for i know that ye seek jesus, which was crucified .
he is not here : for he is ri@@ s@@ en, as he said . come, see the place where the lord lay .
and go quick@@ ly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and, behold, he goeth before you into galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo, i have told you .
and they departed quick@@ ly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did ru@@ n to bring his disciples word .
and as they went to tell his disciples, behold, jesus met them, saying, all ha@@ il . and they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him .
then said jesus unto them, be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into galilee, and there shall they see me .
now when they were go@@ ing, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
and when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken coun@@ sel@@ , they gave l@@ ar@@ ge money unto the soldiers ,
saying, say ye, his disciples came by night, and sto@@ le him away while we sle@@ pt .
and if this come to the governor 's ears, we will persua@@ de him, and secu@@ re you .
so they took the mone@@ y, and did as they were taught : and this saying is com@@ mon@@ ly re@@ por@@ ted among the jews until this day .
then the ele@@ ven disciples went away into galilee, into a mountain where jesus had appointed them .
and when they saw him, they worshipped him : but some doub@@ ted .
and jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
go ye therefore, and teach all na@@ tions, baptiz@@ ing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost :
teaching them to ob@@ serve all things whatsoever i have commanded you : and, lo, i am with you al@@ way, even unto the end of the world . a@@ men .
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ, the son of god ;
as it is written in the prophets, behold, i send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee .
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his pa@@ th@@ s straight .
john did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea, and they of jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the ri@@ ver of jordan, confes@@ sing their sins .
and john was clothed with ca@@ mel 's hai@@ r, and with a gir@@ dle of a sk@@ in about his lo@@ ins ; and he did eat lo@@ cu@@ sts and wi@@ ld hon@@ e@@ y ;
and prea@@ che@@ d, saying, there cometh one migh@@ ti@@ er than i after me, the la@@ t@@ che@@ t of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoo@@ p down and un@@ loose .
i indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost .
and it came to pass in those days, that jesus came from nazareth of galilee, and was baptized of john in jordan .
and straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the spirit like a do@@ ve descen@@ ding upon him :
and there came a voice from heaven, saying, thou art my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased .
and immediately the spirit d@@ ri@@ veth him into the wilderness .
and he was there in the wilderness forty days, temp@@ ted of satan ; and was with the wi@@ ld be@@ asts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after that john was put in prison, jesus came into galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god ,
and saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye, and believe the gospel .
now as he walked by the sea of galilee, he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishe@@ rs .
and jesus said unto them, come ye after me, and i will make you to become fishe@@ rs of men .
and straightway they for@@ so@@ ok their ne@@ ts, and followed him .
and when he had gone a little far@@ ther thence, he saw james the son of zebedee, and john his brother, who also were in the ship men@@ ding their ne@@ ts .
and straightway he called them : and they left their father zebede@@ e in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him .
and they went into capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had author@@ i@@ ty, and not as the scribes .
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
saying, let us alone ; what have we to do with thee, thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou ar@@ t, the holy one of god .
and jesus rebuked him, saying, hold thy peace, and come out of him .
and when the unclean spirit had tor@@ n him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him .
and they were all amazed, insomuch that they questi@@ oned among themselves, saying, what thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority comman@@ deth he even the unclean spiri@@ ts, and they do obey him .
and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee .
and forth@@ wi@@ th, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of simon and and@@ re@@ w, with james and john .
but simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fe@@ ver, and an@@ on they tell him of her .
and he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them .
and at e@@ ven, when the sun did se@@ t, they brought unto him all that were disea@@ sed, and them that were possessed with devils .
and all the city was gathered together at the door .
and he healed many that were sick of divers di@@ seas@@ es, and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him .
and in the mor@@ ning, ri@@ sing up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a so@@ li@@ tar@@ y place, and there prayed .
and simon and they that were with him followed after him .
and when they had found him, they said unto him, all men seek for thee .
and he said unto them, let us go into the next tow@@ ns, that i may preach there also : for therefore came i forth .
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee, and cast out devils .
and there came a le@@ per to him, besee@@ ching him, and knee@@ ling down to him, and saying unto him, if thou wil@@ t, thou canst make me clean .
and jesus, moved with compas@@ sion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, i will ; be thou clean .
and as soon as he had spoken, immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy departed from him, and he was cle@@ ans@@ ed .
and he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away ;
and saith unto him, see thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cle@@ ans@@ ing those things which moses comman@@ ded, for a testimony unto them .
but he went out, and began to publi@@ sh it mu@@ ch, and to bla@@ z@@ e abroad the mat@@ ter, insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert pla@@ ces : and they came to him from every qu@@ ar@@ ter .
and again he entered into capernaum after some days ; and it was no@@ ised that he was in the house .
and straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
and they come unto him, bring@@ ing one sick of the pal@@ sy, which was bor@@ ne of four .
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the pre@@ ss, they un@@ co@@ vered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the pal@@ sy lay .
when jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy, son, thy sins be forgiven thee .
but there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reas@@ oning in their hearts ,
why doth this man thus speak blasphe@@ mi@@ es ? who can forgive sins but god only ?
and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
whether is it easi@@ er to say to the sick of the pal@@ sy, thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say, arise, and take up thy bed, and walk ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, 
i say unto thee, arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house .
and immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified god, saying, we never saw it on this f@@ as@@ hi@@ on .
and he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resor@@ ted unto him, and he taught them .
and as he passed by, he saw le@@ v@@ i the son of al@@ pha@@ e@@ us sitting at the recei@@ pt of custo@@ m, and said unto him, follow me . and he arose and followed him .
and it came to pass, that, as jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples : for there were many, and they followed him .
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sin@@ n@@ ers, they said unto his disciples, how is it that he eateth and drin@@ keth with publicans and sinners ?
when jesus heard it, he saith unto them, they that are whole have no need of the physici@@ an, but they that are sick : i came not to call the righte@@ ous, but sinners to repentance .
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him, why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fa@@ st, but thy disciples fast not ?
and jesus said unto them, can the children of the bride@@ cha@@ mber fa@@ st, while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast .
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days .
no man also se@@ weth a piece of new clo@@ th on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth bur@@ st the bott@@ les, and the wine is spi@@ lled, and the bottles will be mar@@ red : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and it came to pass, that he went through the corn fie@@ l@@ ds on the sabbath day ; and his disciples beg@@ an, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn .
and the pharisees said unto him, behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
and he said unto them, have ye never read what david did, when he had ne@@ ed, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of god in the days of abi@@ a@@ th@@ ar the high priest, and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath :
therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
and they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, stand forth .
and he saith unto them, is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil ? to save life, or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and when he had looked round about on them with an@@ g@@ er, being grie@@ ved for the har@@ dness of their hear@@ ts, he saith unto the man, stret@@ ch forth thine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was re@@ sto@@ red whole as the other .
and the pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the herodi@@ ans against him, how they might destroy him .
but jesus with@@ drew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from galilee followed him, and from judaea ,
and from jerusalem, and from i@@ du@@ ma@@ e@@ a, and from beyond jordan ; and they about tyre and sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him .
and he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should thr@@ ong him .
for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pre@@ ssed upon him for to touch him, as many as had pla@@ gu@@ es .
and unclean spiri@@ ts, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, thou art the son of god .
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
and he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
and he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach ,
and to have power to heal sick@@ nes@@ ses, and to cast out devils :
and simon he surnamed peter ;
and james the son of zebedee, and john the brother of james ; and he surnamed them bo@@ an@@ er@@ ges, which is, the sons of th@@ under :
and and@@ re@@ w, and philip, and bar@@ tho@@ lo@@ me@@ w, and mat@@ the@@ w, and thomas, and james the son of al@@ pha@@ eus, and th@@ ad@@ da@@ eus, and simon the can@@ a@@ ani@@ te ,
and judas iscariot, which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread .
and when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him : for they said, he is beside himself .
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said, he hath beelzebu@@ b, and by the prince of the devils ca@@ ste@@ th he out devils .
and he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, how can satan cast out satan ?
and if a kingdom be divided against itsel@@ f, that kingdom cannot stand .
and if a house be divided against itsel@@ f, that house cannot stand .
and if satan rise up against himself, and be divi@@ ded, he cannot st@@ and, but hath an end .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house, and spo@@ il his goo@@ ds, except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spo@@ il his house .
verily i say unto you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphe@@ mi@@ es wherewith soever they shall blasphe@@ me :
but he that shall blasphe@@ me against the holy ghost hath never forgi@@ ven@@ es@@ s, but is in danger of eternal dam@@ nation .
because they said, he hath an unclean spirit .
there came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him .
and the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
and he answered them, saying, who is my mother, or my brethren ?
and he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, behold my mother and my brethren !
for whosoever shall do the will of god, the same is my brother, and my si@@ ster, and mother .
and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
and he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine ,
hearken ; behold, there went out a so@@ wer to sow :
and it came to pass, as he so@@ wed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
and some fell on ston@@ y ground, where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sp@@ ran@@ g up, because it had no de@@ p@@ th of earth :
but when the sun was up, it was scor@@ ched ; and because it had no roo@@ t, it withered away .
and some fell among thorns, and the thorns gre@@ w up, and cho@@ ked it, and it y@@ i@@ eld@@ ed no fruit .
and other fell on good ground, and did y@@ i@@ e@@ ld fruit that sp@@ ran@@ g up and incre@@ ased ; and brought forth, some thir@@ ty, and some six@@ ty, and some an hundred .
and he said unto them, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear .
and when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
and he said unto them, unto you it is given to know the my@@ ster@@ y of the kingdom of god : but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables :
that seeing they may see, and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear, and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them .
and he said unto them, know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
the so@@ wer so@@ weth the word .
and these are they by the way side, where the word is sown ; but when they have heard, satan cometh immediate@@ ly, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
and these are they likewise which are sown on ston@@ y ground ; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gla@@ dness ;
and have no roo@@ t in themselves, and so en@@ du@@ re but for a time : after@@ ward, when affli@@ ction or persecu@@ tion ari@@ seth for the word 's sake, immediately they are offended .
and these are they which are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word ,
and the ca@@ res of this world, and the decei@@ t@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ che@@ s, and the lu@@ sts of other things entering in, cho@@ ke the word, and it be@@ cometh un@@ fru@@ it@@ ful .
and these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thir@@ ty@@ fold, some six@@ ty, and some an hundred .
and he said unto them, is a can@@ dle brought to be put under a bu@@ she@@ l, or under a bed ? and not to be set on a can@@ d@@ les@@ ti@@ ck ?
for there is nothing hi@@ d, which shall not be mani@@ fes@@ ted ; neither was any thing kept secre@@ t, but that it should come abroad .
if any man have ears to hear, let him hear .
and he said unto them, take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye me@@ te, it shall be measu@@ red to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
for he that ha@@ th, to him shall be given : and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
and he said, so is the kingdom of god, as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
and should sle@@ ep, and rise night and day, and the seed should sp@@ ring and g@@ row up, he knoweth not how .
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of hersel@@ f ; first the bla@@ de, then the ear@@ , after that the full corn in the ear .
but when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sick@@ le, because the harvest is come .
and he said, whereunto shall we li@@ ken the kingdom of god ? or with what com@@ par@@ i@@ son shall we comp@@ are it ?
it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the see@@ ds that be in the earth :
but when it is so@@ w@@ n, it g@@ ro@@ weth up, and be@@ cometh greater than all he@@ r@@ b@@ s, and sho@@ o@@ teth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lo@@ dge under the shadow of it .
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it .
but without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone, he ex@@ p@@ ounded all things to his disciples .
and the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, let us pass over unto the other side .
and when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little shi@@ ps .
and there arose a great stor@@ m of wind, and the wa@@ ves beat into the ship, so that it was now full .
and he was in the hin@@ der part of the ship, asle@@ ep on a pi@@ llo@@ w : and they a@@ wa@@ ke him, and say unto him, master, ca@@ rest thou not that we perish ?
and he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, peace, be still . and the wind cea@@ sed, and there was a great cal@@ m .
and he said unto them, why are ye so fe@@ ar@@ ful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
and they feared excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly, and said one to another, what manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the ga@@ da@@ re@@ ne@@ s .
and when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the to@@ mbs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwel@@ ling among the to@@ mbs ; and no man could bind him, no, not with cha@@ ins :
because that he had been of@@ ten bound with fe@@ tters and cha@@ in@@ s, and the cha@@ ins had been plu@@ cked as@@ under by him, and the fe@@ tters broken in pieces : neither could any man ta@@ me him .
and al@@ ways, night and day, he was in the moun@@ tains, and in the to@@ mb@@ s, c@@ ry@@ ing, and cu@@ tting himself with stones .
but when he saw jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him ,
and cried with a loud voice, and said, what have i to do with thee, jesus, thou son of the most high god ? i ad@@ ju@@ re thee by god, that thou tor@@ ment me not .
for he said unto him, come out of the man, thou unclean spirit .
and he asked him, what is thy name ? and he answered, saying, my name is le@@ gion : for we are many .
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
now there was there nigh unto the moun@@ tains a great herd of swine fee@@ ding .
and all the devils besought him, saying, send us into the s@@ win@@ e, that we may enter into them .
and forthwith jesus gave them leave . and the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine : and the herd ran vio@@ len@@ tly down a ste@@ ep place into the sea, and were cho@@ ked in the sea .
and they that f@@ ed the swine f@@ led, and told it in the city, and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the le@@ gi@@ on, si@@ tt@@ ing, and clothe@@ d, and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they that saw it told them how it be@@ fell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine .
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
and when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
howbeit jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, go home to thy frien@@ ds, and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee .
and he departed, and began to publi@@ sh in de@@ ca@@ pol@@ is how great things jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, ja@@ i@@ r@@ us by name ; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet ,
and besought him grea@@ tly, saying, my little daughter lie@@ th at the poin@@ t of death : i pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
and jesus went with him ; and much people followed him, and thr@@ on@@ ged him .
and a certain woman, which had an is@@ su@@ e of blood twelve years ,
and had suffered many things of many physici@@ ans, and had sp@@ ent all that she ha@@ d, and was nothing be@@ tte@@ red, but rather gre@@ w worse ,
when she had heard of jesus, came in the pre@@ ss behin@@ d, and touched his garment .
for she said, if i may touch but his clothes, i shall be whole .
and straightway the foun@@ tain of her blood was d@@ ried up ; and she fe@@ lt in her body that she was healed of that pla@@ gu@@ e .
and jesus, immediately knowing in himself that vir@@ tu@@ e had gone out of him, turned him about in the pre@@ ss, and said, who touched my clothes ?
and his disciples said unto him, thou se@@ est the multitude thr@@ on@@ ging thee, and sayest thou, who touched me ?
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
but the woman fe@@ aring and tremb@@ ling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth .
and he said unto her, daugh@@ ter, thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace, and be whole of thy pla@@ gu@@ e .
while he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said, thy daughter is dead : why trou@@ bl@@ est thou the master any further ?
as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, be not afrai@@ d, only believe .
and he suffered no man to follow him, save peter, and james, and john the brother of james .
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tu@@ mul@@ t, and them that wept and wai@@ led greatly .
and when he was come in, he saith unto them, why make ye this a@@ do, and weep ? the damsel is not dead, but sle@@ e@@ peth .
and they lau@@ g@@ he@@ d him to s@@ corn . but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the da@@ msel@@ , and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, ta@@ li@@ th@@ a cum@@ i ; which is, being interpre@@ ted, da@@ msel@@ , i say unto thee, arise .
and straightway the damsel arose, and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
and he went out from thence, and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
and when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astoni@@ shed, saying, from whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
is not this the car@@ pen@@ ter, the son of mary, the brother of james, and jo@@ ses, and of juda@@ , and simon ? and are not his si@@ sters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
but jesus, said unto them, a prophet is not without honou@@ r, but in his own country, and among his own k@@ in, and in his own house .
and he could there do no mighty wor@@ k, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick fol@@ k, and healed them .
and he marvelled because of their unbelie@@ f . and he went round about the villages, teaching .
and he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a st@@ af@@ f only ; no scri@@ p, no bread, no money in their pur@@ se :
but be sho@@ d with s@@ and@@ al@@ s ; and not put on two coa@@ ts .
and he said unto them, in what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place .
and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, sha@@ ke off the du@@ st under your feet for a testimony against them . verily i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for so@@ dom and go@@ mor@@ r@@ h@@ a in the day of judgment, than for that city .
and they went out, and preached that men should repent .
and they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them .
and king herod heard of him ; and he said, that john the baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
others said, that it is elias . and others said, that it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets .
but when herod heard thereof, he said, it is john, whom i be@@ hea@@ ded : he is risen from the dead .
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john, and bound him in prison for herodias ' sake, his brother philip 's wife : for he had mar@@ ried her .
for john had said unto herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife .
therefore herodias had a qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l against him, and would have killed him ; but she could not :
for herod feared john, knowing that he was a just man and an ho@@ ly, and ob@@ served him ; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gla@@ dly .
and when a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent day was come, that herod on his bir@@ th@@ day made a sup@@ per to his lor@@ ds, high cap@@ tains, and chief esta@@ tes of galilee ;
and when the daughter of the said herodias came in, and d@@ an@@ ce@@ d, and pleased herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the da@@ msel@@ , ask of me whatsoever thou wil@@ t, and i will give it thee .
and he s@@ ware unto her, whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, i will give it thee, unto the ha@@ l@@ f of my kingdom .
and she went forth, and said unto her mother, what shall i ask ? and she said, the head of john the baptist .
and she came in straightway with ha@@ ste unto the king, and aske@@ d, saying, i will that thou give me by and by in a char@@ ger the head of john the baptist .
and the king was exceeding sor@@ ry ; yet for his oa@@ th 's sake, and for their sa@@ kes which sat with him, he would not reje@@ ct her .
and immediately the king sent an ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ti@@ on@@ er, and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and be@@ hea@@ ded him in the prison ,
and brought his head in a char@@ g@@ er, and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
and when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his cor@@ p@@ se, and laid it in a to@@ mb .
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught .
and he said unto them, come ye yourselves a@@ part into a desert place, and rest a while : for there were many coming and go@@ ing, and they had no le@@ i@@ sure so much as to eat .
and they departed into a desert place by ship private@@ ly .
and the people saw them depar@@ t@@ ing, and many knew him, and ran af@@ o@@ ot thither out of all ci@@ ties, and out@@ went them, and came together unto him .
and jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and when the day was now far sp@@ ent, his disciples came unto him, and said, this is a desert place, and now the time is far passed :
send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
he answered and said unto them, give ye them to eat . and they say unto him, shall we go and buy two hundred penn@@ y@@ wor@@ th of bread, and give them to eat ?
he saith unto them, how many loaves have ye ? go and see . and when they kne@@ w, they say, fi@@ ve, and two fishes .
and he commanded them to make all sit down by comp@@ ani@@ es upon the gre@@ en gra@@ ss .
and they sat down in ran@@ ks, by hundre@@ ds, and by fif@@ ties .
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishe@@ s, he looked up to heaven, and bles@@ sed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
and they did all eat, and were filled .
and they took up twelve baskets full of the frag@@ ments, and of the fishes .
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
and straightway he con@@ strained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto bethsai@@ da@@ , while he sent away the people .
and when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray .
and when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land .
and he saw them to@@ i@@ ling in row@@ ing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the four@@ th watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them .
but when they saw him walking upon the sea, they suppo@@ sed it had been a spirit, and cried out :
for they all saw him, and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, be of good che@@ er : it is i ; be not afraid .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ce@@ ased : and they were sore amaz@@ ed in themselves beyond measu@@ re, and wondered .
for they consi@@ dered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was har@@ d@@ ened .
and when they had passed o@@ ver, they came into the land of gen@@ ne@@ sa@@ re@@ t, and drew to the shor@@ e .
and when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him ,
and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in be@@ ds those that were sick, where they heard he was .
and whi@@ ther@@ soever he ente@@ red, into villages, or ci@@ ties, or country, they laid the sick in the stree@@ ts, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the bor@@ der of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
then came together unto him the pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from jerusalem .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with de@@ fi@@ led, that is to say, with un@@ washe@@ n, hands, they found fault .
for the pharisees, and all the jews, except they wash their hands of@@ t, eat not, ho@@ lding the tradition of the elders .
and when they come from the marke@@ t, except they was@@ h, they eat not . and many other things there be, which they have received to ho@@ ld, as the was@@ hing of c@@ up@@ s, and po@@ ts, bra@@ sen ves@@ sel@@ s, and of ta@@ b@@ les .
then the pharisees and scribes asked him, why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with un@@ washe@@ n hands ?
he answered and said unto them, well hath esaias prophesi@@ ed of you hypocri@@ tes, as it is written, this people honou@@ reth me with their li@@ p@@ s, but their heart is far from me .
howbeit in va@@ in do they worship me, teaching for doctr@@ in@@ es the commandments of men .
for la@@ ying aside the commandment of god, ye hold the tradition of men, as the was@@ hing of po@@ ts and c@@ up@@ s : and many other such like things ye do .
and he said unto them, full well ye reje@@ ct the commandment of god, that ye may keep your own tradition .
for moses said, honour thy father and thy mother ; and, whoso cur@@ seth father or mother, let him die the death :
but ye say, if a man shall say to his father or mother, it is cor@@ b@@ an, that is to say, a gif@@ t, by whatsoever thou mi@@ ght@@ est be profi@@ ted by me ; he shall be free .
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
ma@@ king the word of god of none e@@ ffe@@ ct through your tra@@ di@@ tion, which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
and when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, hearken unto me every one of you, and understand :
there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can de@@ file him : but the things which come out of him, those are they that de@@ file the man .
if any man have ears to hear, let him hear .
and when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
and he saith unto them, are ye so without under@@ standing also ? do ye not percei@@ ve, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot de@@ file him ;
because it entereth not into his heart, but into the be@@ l@@ ly, and goeth out into the dra@@ u@@ ght, pur@@ ging all me@@ a@@ ts ?
and he said, that which cometh out of the man, that de@@ fi@@ leth the man .
for from with@@ in, out of the heart of men, proce@@ ed evil thoughts, adulter@@ i@@ es, forni@@ ca@@ tions, mur@@ d@@ ers ,
the@@ f@@ ts, cove@@ tou@@ s@@ ness, wi@@ c@@ ke@@ d@@ ness, decei@@ t, la@@ s@@ ci@@ vi@@ ous@@ ness, an evil eye, blasphe@@ m@@ y, pri@@ de, foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness :
all these evil things come from with@@ in, and de@@ file the man .
and from thence he arose, and went into the bor@@ d@@ ers of tyre and sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
for a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet :
the woman was a gree@@ k, a sy@@ ro@@ phe@@ ni@@ ci@@ an by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
but jesus said unto her, let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread, and to cast it unto the do@@ gs .
and she answered and said unto him, y@@ es, lord : yet the do@@ gs under the table eat of the children 's cru@@ mbs .
and he said unto her, for this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
and when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and again, depar@@ ting from the coasts of tyre and sidon, he came unto the sea of galilee, through the midst of the coasts of de@@ ca@@ pol@@ is .
and they bring unto him one that was de@@ af@@ , and had an im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment in his speech ; and they besee@@ ch him to put his hand upon him .
and he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fing@@ ers into his ears, and he spi@@ t, and touched his tongue ;
and looking up to heaven, he sig@@ he@@ d, and saith unto him, ep@@ h@@ pha@@ tha, that is, be opened .
and straightway his ears were opened, and the str@@ ing of his tongue was loo@@ sed, and he spake pla@@ in .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them, so much the more a great dea@@ l they publi@@ shed it ;
and were beyond measure astoni@@ shed, saying, he hath done all things well : he ma@@ keth both the dea@@ f to hear, and the dumb to speak .
in those days the multitude being very grea@@ t, and having nothing to eat, jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them ,
i have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat :
and if i send them away fa@@ sting to their own houses, they will fa@@ in@@ t by the way : for divers of them came from far .
and his disciples answered him, from whence can a man sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
and he asked them, how many loaves have ye ? and they said, seven .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and bra@@ ke, and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they had a few small fishes : and he bles@@ sed, and commanded to set them also before them .
so they did eat, and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
and they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the par@@ ts of dal@@ man@@ u@@ th@@ a .
and the pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him .
and he sig@@ he@@ d de@@ ep@@ ly in his spirit, and saith, why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily i say unto you, there shall no sign be given unto this generation .
and he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
now the disciples had for@@ gotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loa@@ f .
and he charged them, saying, take he@@ ed, beware of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of herod .
and they reasoned among themselves, saying, it is because we have no bread .
and when jesus knew it, he saith unto them, why reason ye, because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not ye@@ t, neither understand ? have ye your heart yet har@@ d@@ ened ?
having eyes, see ye not ? and having ears, hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
when i brake the five loaves among five thous@@ and, how many baskets full of frag@@ ments took ye up ? they say unto him, twelve .
and when the seven among four thous@@ and, how many baskets full of frag@@ ments took ye up ? and they said, seven .
and he said unto them, how is it that ye do not understand ?
and he cometh to bethsai@@ da ; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him .
and he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought .
and he looked up, and said, i see men as tre@@ es, walking .
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up : and he was re@@ sto@@ red, and saw every man cle@@ ar@@ ly .
and he sent him away to his house, saying, neither go into the tow@@ n, nor tell it to any in the town .
and jesus went out, and his disciples, into the tow@@ ns of caesarea phili@@ pp@@ i : and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, whom do men say that i am ?
and they answered, john the baptist ; but some say, elias ; and others, one of the prophets .
and he saith unto them, but whom say ye that i am ? and peter answe@@ reth and saith unto him, thou art the christ .
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
and he began to teach them, that the son of man must suffer many things, and be reje@@ cted of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be ki@@ lled, and after three days rise again .
and he spake that saying openly . and peter took him, and began to rebu@@ ke him .
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked peter, saying, get thee behind me, satan : for thou sa@@ v@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of god, but the things that be of men .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's, the same shall save it .
for what shall it pro@@ f@@ it a man, if he shall ga@@ in the whole world, and lose his own soul ?
or what shall a man give in ex@@ chan@@ ge for his soul ?
whosoever therefore shall be a@@ sha@@ med of me and of my words in this adulter@@ ous and sin@@ ful generation ; of him also shall the son of man be a@@ sha@@ med, when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels .
and he said unto them, verily i say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not ta@@ ste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power .
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter, and james, and john, and lea@@ deth them up into an high mountain a@@ part by themselves : and he was trans@@ fi@@ gu@@ red before them .
and his raiment be@@ came shi@@ ning, exceeding white as s@@ now ; so as no ful@@ ler on earth can white them .
and there appeared unto them elias with moses : and they were tal@@ king with jesus .
and peter answered and said to jesus, master, it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernac@@ les ; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias .
for he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
and there was a c@@ loud that over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed them : and a voice came out of the clou@@ d, saying, this is my beloved son : hear him .
and sudden@@ ly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save jesus only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had se@@ en, till the son of man were risen from the dead .
and they kept that saying with themselves, questi@@ oning one with another what the ri@@ sing from the dead should mean .
and they asked him, saying, why say the scribes that elias must first come ?
and he answered and told them, elias verily cometh first, and re@@ sto@@ reth all things ; and how it is written of the son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at n@@ ought .
but i say unto you, that elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they li@@ s@@ ted, as it is written of him .
and when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questi@@ oning with them .
and straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and run@@ ning to him salu@@ ted him .
and he asked the scribes, what question ye with them ?
and one of the multitude answered and said, master, i have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit ;
and wheresoever he taketh him, he tea@@ reth him : and he fo@@ a@@ me@@ th, and gnas@@ he@@ th with his te@@ eth, and p@@ in@@ eth away : and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
he answe@@ reth him, and saith, o faith@@ less generation, how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him unto me .
and they brought him unto him : and when he saw him, straightway the spirit t@@ are him ; and he fell on the ground, and wal@@ lo@@ wed fo@@ am@@ ing .
and he asked his father, how long is it a@@ go since this came unto him ? and he said, of a child .
and of@@ t@@ times it hath cast him into the fire, and into the wa@@ ter@@ s, to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us .
jesus said unto him, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth .
and straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with te@@ ar@@ s, lord, i believe ; help thou mine unbelie@@ f .
when jesus saw that the people came run@@ ning together, he rebuked the f@@ ou@@ l spirit, saying unto him, thou dumb and dea@@ f spirit, i charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him .
and the spirit cried, and rent him so@@ re, and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said, he is dead .
but jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up ; and he arose .
and when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him private@@ ly, why could not we cast him out ?
and he said unto them, this k@@ ind can come forth by no@@ thing, but by prayer and fa@@ sting .
and they departed thence, and passed through galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
for he taught his disciples, and said unto them, the son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him ; and after that he is ki@@ lled, he shall rise the third day .
but they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him .
and he came to capernaum : and being in the house he asked them, what was it that ye dispu@@ ted among yourselves by the way ?
but they held their peace : for by the way they had dispu@@ ted among themselves, who should be the greatest .
and he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, if any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all .
and he took a child, and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his ar@@ ms, he said unto them ,
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me .
and john answered him, saying, master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he follo@@ weth not us : and we for@@ ba@@ d him, because he follo@@ weth not us .
but jesus said, forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can light@@ ly speak evil of me .
for he that is not against us is on our part .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye be@@ long to christ, verily i say unto you, he shall not lose his reward .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a mi@@ ll@@ stone were hanged about his ne@@ ck, and he were cast into the sea .
and if thy hand offend thee, cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life mai@@ med, than having two hands to go into he@@ ll, into the fire that never shall be quen@@ ched :
where their wor@@ m di@@ eth not, and the fire is not quen@@ ched .
and if thy foot offend thee, cut it off : it is better for thee to enter ha@@ lt into life, than having two feet to be cast into he@@ ll, into the fire that never shall be quen@@ ched :
where their wor@@ m di@@ eth not, and the fire is not quen@@ ched .
and if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
where their wor@@ m di@@ eth not, and the fire is not quen@@ ched .
for every one shall be sal@@ ted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be sal@@ ted with salt .
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his sal@@ t@@ ness, wherewith will ye season it ? have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another .
and he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the far@@ ther side of jordan : and the people resor@@ t unto him again ; and, as he was won@@ t, he taught them again .
and the pharisees came to him, and asked him, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
and he answered and said unto them, what did moses command you ?
and they said, moses suffered to write a bi@@ ll of di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ ment, and to put her away .
and jesus answered and said unto them, for the har@@ dness of your heart he wrote you this pre@@ ce@@ pt .
but from the beginning of the crea@@ tion god made them ma@@ le and fe@@ ma@@ le .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and c@@ leave to his wife ;
and they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twa@@ in, but one flesh .
what therefore god hath jo@@ ined together, let not man put as@@ under .
and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
and he saith unto them, whosoever shall put away his wife, and mar@@ ry another, committeth adultery against her .
and if a woman shall put away her husb@@ and, and be mar@@ ried to another, she committeth adultery .
and they brought young children to him, that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
but when jesus saw it, he was much disp@@ lea@@ sed, and said unto them, suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
verily i say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child, he shall not enter therein .
and he took them up in his ar@@ ms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them .
and when he was gone forth into the way, there came one run@@ ning, and kneeled to him, and asked him, good master, what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life ?
and jesus said unto him, why cal@@ lest thou me good ? there is none good but one, that is, god .
thou knowest the command@@ ments, do not commit adulter@@ y, do not ki@@ ll, do not ste@@ al, do not bear false witness, de@@ fra@@ u@@ d not, honour thy father and mother .
and he answered and said unto him, master, all these have i ob@@ served from my you@@ th .
then jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, one thing thou la@@ ck@@ est : go thy way, se@@ ll whatsoever thou ha@@ st, and give to the po@@ or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come, take up the cross, and follow me .
and he was sa@@ d at that saying, and went away grie@@ ved : for he had great posses@@ sions .
and jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, how har@@ dly shall they that have ri@@ ches enter into the kingdom of god !
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but jesus answe@@ reth again, and saith unto them, children, how hard is it for them that tru@@ st in ri@@ ches to enter into the kingdom of god !
it is easi@@ er for a ca@@ mel to go through the eye of a nee@@ dle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they were astonished out of measu@@ re, saying among themselves, who then can be saved ?
and jesus looking upon them saith, with men it is im@@ possible, but not with god : for with god all things are possible .
then peter began to say unto him, lo, we have left all, and have followed thee .
and jesus answered and said, verily i say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or si@@ st@@ ers, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or l@@ and@@ s, for my sake, and the gospel 's ,
but he shall receive an hundre@@ d@@ fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and si@@ st@@ ers, and mo@@ thers, and children, and l@@ and@@ s, with persecu@@ tions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
but many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem ; and jesus went before them : and they were amaz@@ ed ; and as they follo@@ wed, they were afraid . and he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should ha@@ p@@ pen unto him ,
saying, behold, we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the gentiles :
and they shall mo@@ ck him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
and james and john, the sons of zebedee, come unto him, saying, master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
and he said unto them, what would ye that i should do for you ?
they said unto him, gran@@ t unto us that we may si@@ t, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory .
but jesus said unto them, ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that i drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ?
and they said unto him, we can . and jesus said unto them, ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of ; and with the baptism that i am baptized with@@ al shall ye be baptized :
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
and when the ten heard it, they began to be much disp@@ leased with james and john .
but jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, ye know that they which are ac@@ counted to ru@@ le over the gentiles exercise lor@@ d@@ ship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
but so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister :
and whosoever of you will be the chi@@ e@@ fes@@ t, shall be servant of all .
for even the son of man came not to be ministered un@@ to@@ , but to mini@@ ster, and to give his life a ran@@ som for many .
and they came to jeri@@ ch@@ o : and as he went out of jeri@@ ch@@ o with his disciples and a great number of people, blind bar@@ ti@@ ma@@ eus, the son of ti@@ ma@@ eus, sat by the high@@ way side beg@@ ging .
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth, he began to c@@ ry out, and say, jesus, thou son of david, have mercy on me .
and many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great de@@ al, thou son of david, have mercy on me .
and jesus stood sti@@ ll, and commanded him to be called . and they call the blind man, saying unto him, be of good comfor@@ t, rise ; he calleth thee .
and he, casting away his gar@@ ment, ro@@ se, and came to jesus .
and jesus answered and said unto him, what wilt thou that i should do unto thee ? the blind man said unto him, lord, that i might receive my sight .
and jesus said unto him, go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight, and followed jesus in the way .
and when they came nigh to jerusalem, unto beth@@ pha@@ ge and bethany, at the mount of oli@@ ves, he sen@@ deth forth two of his disciples ,
and saith unto them, go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt ti@@ ed, where@@ on never man sat ; loose him, and bring him .
and if any man say unto you, why do ye this ? say ye that the lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
and they went their way, and found the colt ti@@ ed by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and certain of them that stood there said unto them, what do ye, loo@@ sing the colt ?
and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
and they brought the colt to jesus, and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the tre@@ es, and stra@@ wed them in the way .
and they that went be@@ fore, and they that follo@@ wed, cried, saying, hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord :
blessed be the kingdom of our father david, that cometh in the name of the lord : hosanna in the highest .
and jesus entered into jerusalem, and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the even@@ ti@@ de was come, he went out unto beth@@ any with the twelve .
and on the morrow, when they were come from bethany, he was hun@@ g@@ ry :
and seeing a fig tree afar off having lea@@ ves, he came, if ha@@ ply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it, he found nothing but lea@@ ves ; for the time of fi@@ gs was not yet .
and jesus answered and said unto it, no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . and his disciples heard it .
and they come to jerusalem : and jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and over@@ threw the ta@@ b@@ les of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ g@@ ers, and the seats of them that sold do@@ ves ;
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
and he ta@@ u@@ ght, saying unto them, is it not written, my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
and when even was come, he went out of the city .
and in the mor@@ ning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree d@@ ried up from the roo@@ ts .
and peter calling to reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance saith unto him, master, behold, the fig tree which thou cur@@ se@@ dst is withered away .
and jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in god .
for verily i say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou re@@ mo@@ ved, and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doub@@ t in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
therefore i say unto you, what things soever ye desi@@ re, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them .
and when ye stand pray@@ ing, forgi@@ ve, if ye have ought against any : that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespas@@ ses .
but if ye do not forgi@@ ve, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespas@@ ses .
and they come again to jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders ,
and say unto him, by what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
and jesus answered and said unto them, i will also ask of you one ques@@ tion, and answer me, and i will tell you by what authority i do these things .
the baptism of john, was it from heaven, or of men ? answer me .
and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven ; he will say, why then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say, of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted john, that he was a prophet indeed .
and they answered and said unto jesus, we cannot tell . and jesus answering saith unto them, neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things .
and he began to speak unto them by parables . a certain man plan@@ ted a vineyard, and set an he@@ dge about it, and di@@ g@@ ged a place for the win@@ e@@ fa@@ t, and built a to@@ wer@@ , and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country .
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
and they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away e@@ mp@@ ty .
and again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast ston@@ es, and w@@ ounded him in the head, and sent him away sha@@ me@@ fully han@@ d@@ led .
and again he sent another ; and him they ki@@ lled, and many others ; bea@@ ting so@@ me, and ki@@ l@@ ling some .
having yet therefore one son, his wel@@ l@@ be@@ lo@@ ved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, they will reve@@ re@@ nce my son .
but those husbandmen said among themselves, this is the he@@ ir ; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our 's .
and they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard .
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others .
and have ye not read this scripture ; the stone which the build@@ ers reje@@ cted is become the head of the cor@@ ner :
this was the lord 's do@@ ing, and it is marve@@ ll@@ ous in our eyes ?
and they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him, and went their way .
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodi@@ ans, to ca@@ tch him in his words .
and when they were come, they say unto him, master, we know that thou art true, and ca@@ rest for no man : for thou regar@@ dest not the per@@ son of men, but teac@@ hest the way of god in truth : is it lawful to give tribute to caesar, or not ?
shall we gi@@ ve, or shall we not give ? but he, knowing their hypocri@@ sy, said unto them, why tempt ye me ? bring me a penn@@ y, that i may see it .
and they brought it . and he saith unto them, whose is this image and super@@ scrip@@ tion ? and they said unto him, caesar 's .
and jesus answering said unto them, ren@@ der to caesar the things that are caesar 's, and to god the things that are god 's . and they marvelled at him .
then come unto him the sadduce@@ es, which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him, saying ,
master, moses wrote unto us, if a man 's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother .
now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife, and d@@ ying left no seed .
and the second took her, and di@@ ed, neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
and the seven had her, and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
in the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
and jesus answering said unto them, do ye not therefore er@@ r, because ye know not the scriptu@@ res, neither the power of god ?
for when they shall rise from the dead, they neither mar@@ ry, nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
and as touching the dead, that they rise : have ye not read in the book of moses, how in the bu@@ sh god spake unto him, saying, i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob ?
he is not the god of the dead, but the god of the living : ye therefore do greatly er@@ r .
and one of the scribes came, and having heard them reas@@ oning together, and percei@@ ving that he had answered them well, asked him, which is the first commandment of all ?
and jesus answered him, the first of all the commandments is, hear, o israel ; the lord our god is one lord :
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy min@@ d, and with all thy streng@@ th : this is the first commandment .
and the second is li@@ ke, na@@ me@@ ly this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and the scri@@ be said unto him, well, master, thou hast said the truth : for there is one god ; and there is none other but he :
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the under@@ standing, and with all the soul, and with all the streng@@ th, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole bur@@ n@@ t off@@ er@@ ings and sacrifi@@ ces .
and when jesus saw that he answered dis@@ cre@@ e@@ tly, he said unto him, thou art not far from the kingdom of god . and no man after that du@@ rst ask him any question .
and jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, how say the scribes that christ is the son of david ?
for david himself said by the holy ghost, the lord said to my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemi@@ es thy foo@@ tstool .
david therefore himself calleth him lord ; and whence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gla@@ dly .
and he said unto them in his doctr@@ in@@ e, beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clo@@ thing, and love salu@@ ta@@ tions in the marke@@ t@@ pla@@ ces ,
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the up@@ per@@ most roo@@ ms at fea@@ sts :
which dev@@ our widows ' houses, and for a pre@@ t@@ ence make long pray@@ ers : these shall receive greater dam@@ nation .
and jesus sat over against the treasu@@ ry, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasu@@ ry : and many that were rich cast in much .
and there came a certain poor wi@@ do@@ w, and she threw in two mi@@ tes, which make a far@@ thing .
and he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, verily i say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasu@@ ry :
for all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she ha@@ d, even all her living .
and as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, master, see what manner of stones and what build@@ ings are here !
and jesus answering said unto him, se@@ est thou these great build@@ ings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be th@@ ro@@ wn down .
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple, peter and james and john and andrew asked him private@@ ly ,
tell us, when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
and jesus answering them began to say, take heed lest any man decei@@ ve you :
for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ ; and shall decei@@ ve many .
and when ye shall hear of war@@ s and ru@@ mour@@ s of war@@ s, be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earth@@ qua@@ kes in divers places, and there shall be fa@@ min@@ es and troub@@ les : these are the begin@@ n@@ ings of sorrow@@ s .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to counci@@ ls ; and in the synagogues ye shall be be@@ ate@@ n : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them .
and the gospel must first be publi@@ shed among all nations .
but when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought be@@ fore@@ hand what ye shall speak, neither do ye pre@@ medi@@ ta@@ te : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak, but the holy ghost .
now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall en@@ du@@ re unto the en@@ d, the same shall be saved .
but when ye shall see the abo@@ min@@ ation of deso@@ la@@ tion, spoken of by d@@ ani@@ el the prophet, standing where it ought not, then let them that be in judaea flee to the moun@@ tains :
and let him that is on the house@@ top not go down into the house, neither enter there@@ in, to take any thing out of his house :
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
but woe to them that are with child, and to them that give su@@ ck in those days !
and pray ye that your f@@ light be not in the win@@ ter .
for in those days shall be affli@@ ction, such as was not from the beginning of the crea@@ tion which god crea@@ ted unto this time, neither shall be .
and except that the lord had shor@@ t@@ ened those days, no flesh should be saved : but for the ele@@ ct 's sake, whom he hath cho@@ s@@ en, he hath shor@@ t@@ ened the days .
and then if any man shall say to you, lo, here is christ ; or, lo, he is there ; believe him not :
for false chri@@ sts and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wond@@ ers, to se@@ du@@ ce, if it were possible, even the ele@@ ct .
but take ye heed : behold, i have fore@@ told you all things .
but in those days, after that tribu@@ la@@ tion, the sun shall be dark@@ en@@ ed, and the mo@@ on shall not give her light ,
and the star@@ s of heaven shall fal@@ l, and the power@@ s that are in heaven shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clou@@ ds with great power and glory .
and then shall he send his ange@@ ls, and shall gather together his ele@@ ct from the four win@@ ds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
now lear@@ n a parable of the fig tree ; when her bran@@ ch is yet ten@@ d@@ er, and putteth forth lea@@ ves, ye know that su@@ m@@ me@@ r is near :
so ye in like man@@ n@@ er, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh@@ , even at the doors .
verily i say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the son, but the father .
take ye he@@ ed, watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his wor@@ k, and commanded the por@@ ter to watch .
watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at e@@ ven, or at mid@@ night, or at the co@@ ck@@ cro@@ w@@ ing, or in the morning :
lest coming suddenly he find you sle@@ ep@@ ing .
and what i say unto you i say unto all, watch .
after two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by cra@@ f@@ t, and put him to death .
but they said, not on the feast day, lest there be an upro@@ ar of the people .
and being in beth@@ any in the house of simon the le@@ per, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an a@@ lab@@ as@@ ter bo@@ x of ointment of spi@@ k@@ en@@ ard very pre@@ ci@@ ous ; and she brake the bo@@ x@@ , and p@@ oured it on his head .
and there were some that had indi@@ g@@ nation within themselves, and said, why was this wa@@ ste of the ointment made ?
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pen@@ ce, and have been given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
and jesus said, let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
for ye have the poor with you al@@ ways, and whe@@ n@@ soever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
she hath done what she could : she is come af@@ o@@ re@@ hand to anoin@@ t my body to the bur@@ ying .
verily i say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a me@@ mor@@ i@@ al of her .
and judas iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them .
and when they heard it, they were gla@@ d, and promi@@ sed to give him money . and he sought how he might con@@ ven@@ i@@ en@@ tly betray him .
and the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
and he sen@@ deth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man be@@ aring a pi@@ t@@ c@@ her of water : follow him .
and wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goo@@ d@@ man of the house, the master saith, where is the gu@@ es@@ t@@ cha@@ mb@@ er, where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and he will shew you a l@@ ar@@ ge upper room fur@@ ni@@ shed and prepared : there make ready for us .
and his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and in the even@@ ing he cometh with the twelve .
and as they sat and did eat, jesus said, verily i say unto you, one of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
and they began to be sorrow@@ ful, and to say unto him one by one, is it i ? and another said, is it i ?
and he answered and said unto them, it is one of the twelve, that di@@ p@@ peth with me in the dis@@ h .
the son of man indeed go@@ eth, as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat, jesus took bread, and bles@@ sed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, ta@@ ke, eat : this is my body .
and he took the c@@ up, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them : and they all d@@ ran@@ k of it .
and he said unto them, this is my blood of the new t@@ esta@@ ment, which is shed for many .
verily i say unto you, i will drink no more of the fruit of the vin@@ e, until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god .
and when they had sun@@ g an hy@@ m@@ n, they went out into the mount of olives .
and jesus saith unto them, all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written, i will smite the shepher@@ d, and the sheep shall be scattered .
but after that i am ri@@ s@@ en, i will go before you into galilee .
but peter said unto him, al@@ though all shall be offen@@ ded, yet will not i .
and jesus saith unto him, verily i say unto thee, that this day, even in this night, before the cock c@@ row t@@ wi@@ ce, thou shalt deny me thrice .
but he spake the more ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly, if i should die with thee, i will not deny thee in any wise . likewise also said they all .
and they came to a place which was named ge@@ th@@ se@@ man@@ e : and he saith to his disciples, sit ye here, while i shall pray .
and he taketh with him peter and james and john, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy ;
and saith unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrow@@ ful unto death : tarry ye here, and watch .
and he went for@@ ward a li@@ tt@@ le, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him .
and he said, ab@@ ba@@ , father, all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what i will, but what thou wilt .
and he cometh, and findeth them sle@@ ep@@ ing, and saith unto peter, simon, sle@@ ep@@ est thou ? c@@ ouldest not thou watch one hour ?
watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is we@@ a@@ k .
and again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words .
and when he returned, he found them asle@@ ep again, neither wist they what to answer him .
and he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest : it is en@@ ough@@ , the hour is come ; behold, the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
rise up, let us go ; lo, he that betra@@ yeth me is at hand .
and immediate@@ ly, while he yet spake, cometh judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and sta@@ ves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
and he that betrayed him had given them a to@@ ken, saying, whomsoever i shall kis@@ s, that same is he ; take him, and lead him away sa@@ fe@@ ly .
and as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, master, master ; and kis@@ sed him .
and they laid their hands on him, and took him .
and one of them that stood by drew a s@@ word, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear .
and jesus answered and said unto them, are ye come out, as against a thie@@ f, with swords and with sta@@ ves to take me ?
i was daily with you in the temple tea@@ chi@@ ng, and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
and they all for@@ so@@ ok him, and fled .
and there followed him a certain young man, having a linen clo@@ th cast about his na@@ ked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and he left the linen clo@@ th, and fled from them na@@ ked .
and they led jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
and peter followed him afar off, even into the pala@@ ce of the high priest : and he sat with the servants, and war@@ med himself at the fire .
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
for many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together .
and there arose cer@@ tain, and bare false witness against him, saying ,
we heard him say, i will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days i will build another made without hands .
but neither so did their witness agre@@ e together .
and the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked jesus, saying, answe@@ rest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but he held his peace, and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the christ, the son of the blessed ?
and jesus said, i am : and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clou@@ ds of heaven .
then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, what need we any further witnesses ?
ye have heard the blasphe@@ my : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be gui@@ l@@ ty of death .
and some began to spit on him, and to co@@ ver his face, and to bu@@ ffe@@ t him, and to say unto him, prophe@@ sy : and the servants did stri@@ ke him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
and as peter was b@@ ene@@ a@@ th in the pala@@ ce, there cometh one of the mai@@ ds of the high priest :
and when she saw peter war@@ m@@ ing himself, she looked upon him, and said, and thou also wa@@ st with jesus of nazareth .
but he deni@@ ed, saying, i know not, neither understand i what thou sayest . and he went out into the por@@ ch ; and the cock cre@@ w .
and a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, this is one of them .
and he denied it again . and a little af@@ ter, they that stood by said again to peter, sure@@ ly thou art one of them : for thou art a galilae@@ an, and thy speech agre@@ eth there@@ to .
but he began to cur@@ se and to swe@@ ar, saying, i know not this man of whom ye speak .
and the second time the cock cre@@ w . and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him, before the cock c@@ row t@@ wi@@ ce, thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought there@@ on, he wept .
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a cons@@ ul@@ tation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to pilate .
and pilate asked him, art thou the king of the jews ? and he answering said unto them, thou sayest it .
and the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
and pilate asked him again, saying, answe@@ rest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
but jesus yet answered nothing ; so that pilate marvelled .
now at that feast he re@@ leased unto them one prison@@ er, whomsoever they desired .
and there was one named barab@@ bas, which lay bound with them that had made in@@ surre@@ ction with him, who had committed mur@@ der in the in@@ surre@@ ction .
and the multitude crying al@@ ou@@ d began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
but pilate answered them, saying, will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for en@@ v@@ y .
but the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release barabbas unto them .
and pilate answered and said again unto them, what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews ?
and they cried out again, crucify him .
then pilate said unto them, wh@@ y, what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly, crucify him .
and so pilate, willing to cont@@ ent the people, re@@ leased barabbas unto them, and delivered jesus, when he had scour@@ ged him, to be crucified .
and the soldiers led him away into the ha@@ ll, called pra@@ e@@ tor@@ iu@@ m ; and they call together the whole band .
and they clothed him with pur@@ ple, and pla@@ tted a cro@@ wn of thorns, and put it about his head ,
and began to salu@@ te him, hai@@ l, king of the jews !
and they smote him on the head with a re@@ ed, and did spit upon him, and bo@@ wing their kne@@ es worshipped him .
and when they had mocked him, they took off the pur@@ p@@ le from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him .
and they com@@ pe@@ l one simon a cy@@ re@@ ni@@ an, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of alex@@ an@@ der and ru@@ f@@ us, to bear his cross .
and they bring him unto the place go@@ l@@ go@@ tha, which is, being interpre@@ ted, the place of a sk@@ u@@ ll .
and they gave him to drink wine m@@ ing@@ led with my@@ r@@ r@@ h : but he received it not .
and when they had crucified him, they parted his gar@@ ments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take .
and it was the third hour, and they crucified him .
and the super@@ scrip@@ tion of his accu@@ sa@@ tion was written o@@ ver, the king of the jews .
and with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left .
and the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, and he was nu@@ mbered with the transgre@@ s@@ sor@@ s .
and they that passed by rai@@ led on him, wa@@ g@@ ging their hea@@ ds, and saying, a@@ h, thou that destro@@ yest the temple, and bui@@ ldest it in three days ,
save thyself, and come down from the cross .
likewise also the chief priests mo@@ c@@ king said among themselves with the scribes, he saved others ; himself he cannot save .
let christ the king of israel des@@ c@@ end now from the cross, that we may see and believe . and they that were crucified with him re@@ vi@@ led him .
and when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, e@@ lo@@ i, e@@ lo@@ i, la@@ m@@ a sa@@ ba@@ ch@@ than@@ i ? which is, being interpre@@ ted, my god, my god, why hast thou for@@ sa@@ ken me ?
and some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, behold, he calleth elias .
and one ran and filled a sp@@ un@@ ge full of vine@@ gar@@ , and put it on a re@@ ed, and gave him to drin@@ k, saying, let alone ; let us see whether elias will come to take him down .
and jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost .
and the ve@@ il of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m .
and when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, truly this man was the son of god .
there were also women looking on afar off : among whom was mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james the less and of jo@@ ses, and sa@@ lo@@ me ;
and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem .
and now when the even was come, because it was the pre@@ para@@ tion, that is, the day before the sabbath ,
joseph of ari@@ ma@@ tha@@ e@@ a, an honou@@ ra@@ ble coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ , which also waited for the kingdom of god, came, and went in bold@@ ly unto pilate, and cra@@ ved the body of jesus .
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
and when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to joseph .
and he bought f@@ ine lin@@ en, and took him down, and wrapped him in the lin@@ en, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a ro@@ ck, and ro@@ lled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of jo@@ ses beheld where he was laid .
and when the sabbath was pa@@ st, mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james, and sa@@ lo@@ me, had bought swe@@ et spi@@ ces, that they might come and anoin@@ t him .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the ri@@ sing of the sun .
and they said among themselves, who shall ro@@ ll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
and when they loo@@ ked, they saw that the stone was ro@@ lled away : for it was very great .
and entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment ; and they were af@@ fri@@ gh@@ ted .
and he saith unto them, be not af@@ fri@@ gh@@ ted : ye seek jesus of nazareth, which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
but go your way, tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee : there shall ye see him, as he said unto you .
and they went out quick@@ ly, and fled from the sepulchre ; for they tremb@@ led and were amaz@@ ed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to mary magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils .
and she went and told them that had been with him, as they mour@@ ned and wept .
and they, when they had heard that he was a@@ li@@ ve, and had been seen of her, believed not .
after that he appeared in another for@@ m unto two of them, as they wal@@ ked, and went into the country .
and they went and told it unto the resi@@ du@@ e : neither believed they them .
afterward he appeared unto the ele@@ ven as they sat at meat, and up@@ b@@ rai@@ ded them with their unbelie@@ f and har@@ dness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and he said unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every crea@@ ture .
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be dam@@ ned .
and these signs shall follow them that believe ; in my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongu@@ es ;
they shall take up ser@@ pen@@ ts ; and if they drink any dea@@ dly thing, it shall not hu@@ r@@ t them ; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall re@@ co@@ ver .
so then after the lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of god .
and they went forth, and preached every whe@@ re, the lord wor@@ king with them, and con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing the word with signs following . a@@ men .
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in or@@ der a decl@@ ar@@ ation of those things which are most sure@@ ly believed among us ,
even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were e@@ ye@@ witnes@@ ses, and mini@@ sters of the word ;
it seemed good to me also, having had perfect under@@ standing of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in or@@ d@@ er, most exce@@ ll@@ ent the@@ op@@ hi@@ l@@ us ,
that thou mi@@ ght@@ est know the cer@@ tain@@ ty of those things, wherein thou hast been inst@@ ru@@ cted .
there was in the days of herod, the king of judaea, a certain priest named zachari@@ as, of the course of abi@@ a : and his wife was of the daugh@@ ters of a@@ ar@@ on, and her name was elisabeth .
and they were both righteous before god, walking in all the commandments and or@@ d@@ in@@ an@@ ces of the lord bla@@ me@@ less .
and they had no child, because that elisabeth was bar@@ re@@ n, and they both were now well stri@@ c@@ ken in years .
and it came to pass, that while he ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted the priest 's offi@@ ce before god in the or@@ der of his course ,
according to the custom of the priest 's offi@@ ce, his lot was to bur@@ n in@@ cen@@ se when he went into the temple of the lord .
and the whole multitude of the people were pra@@ ying without at the time of in@@ cen@@ se .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the al@@ ta@@ r of in@@ cen@@ se .
and when zacharias saw him, he was troub@@ led, and fear fell upon him .
but the angel said unto him, fear not, zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name john .
and thou shalt have joy and gla@@ dness ; and many shall rejoice at his bir@@ th .
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the holy ghost, even from his mother 's womb .
and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god .
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of eli@@ as, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the lord .
and zacharias said unto the ange@@ l, where@@ by shall i know this ? for i am an old man, and my wife well stri@@ c@@ ken in years .
and the angel answering said unto him, i am ga@@ bri@@ e@@ l, that stand in the presence of god ; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tid@@ ings .
and, behold, thou shalt be du@@ mb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be perfor@@ med, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season .
and the people waited for zachari@@ as, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
and when he came out, he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beck@@ oned unto them, and remained spee@@ ch@@ less .
and it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his mini@@ stra@@ tion were accompli@@ shed, he departed to his own house .
and after those days his wife elisabeth con@@ cei@@ ved, and hid hersel@@ f five months, saying ,
thus hath the lord de@@ al@@ t with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my repro@@ a@@ ch among men .
and in the sixth mon@@ th the angel ga@@ bri@@ el was sent from god unto a city of galilee, named nazareth ,
to a virg@@ in es@@ p@@ ou@@ sed to a man whose name was joseph, of the house of david ; and the virg@@ in 's name was mary .
and the angel came in unto her, and said, hai@@ l, thou that art high@@ ly fav@@ ou@@ red, the lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
and when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salu@@ tation this should be .
and the angel said unto her, fear not, mary : for thou hast found fav@@ our with god .
and, behold, thou shalt con@@ cei@@ ve in thy wo@@ mb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name jesus .
he shall be grea@@ t, and shall be called the son of the highest : and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david :
and he shall re@@ ign over the house of jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
then said mary unto the ange@@ l, how shall this be, seeing i know not a man ?
and the angel answered and said unto her, the holy ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall over@@ shadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god .
and, behold, thy c@@ ous@@ in elisabe@@ th, she hath also con@@ cei@@ ved a son in her old age : and this is the sixth mon@@ th with her, who was called bar@@ re@@ n .
for with god nothing shall be im@@ possible .
and mary said, behold the han@@ d@@ maid of the lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . and the angel departed from her .
and mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with ha@@ ste@@ , into a city of jud@@ a ;
and entered into the house of zachari@@ as, and salu@@ ted elisabeth .
and it came to pass, that, when elisabeth heard the salu@@ tation of mary, the ba@@ be lea@@ ped in her womb ; and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost :
and she spake out with a loud voice, and said, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
and whence is this to me, that the mother of my lord should come to me ?
for, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salu@@ tation s@@ ounded in mine ears, the ba@@ be lea@@ ped in my womb for joy .
and blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a perfor@@ man@@ ce of those things which were told her from the lord .
and mary said, my soul doth mag@@ ni@@ fy the lord ,
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my sa@@ vi@@ our .
for he hath regar@@ ded the low esta@@ te of his han@@ d@@ mai@@ den : for, behold, from henceforth all genera@@ tions shall call me blessed .
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
he hath shewed streng@@ th with his ar@@ m ; he hath scattered the p@@ r@@ ou@@ d in the i@@ mag@@ in@@ ation of their hearts .
he hath put down the mighty from their sea@@ ts, and exalted them of low de@@ gre@@ e .
he hath filled the hun@@ g@@ ry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent e@@ mp@@ ty away .
he hath ho@@ l@@ pen his servant israel, in reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance of his mercy ;
as he spake to our fathers, to abraham, and to his seed for ever .
and mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house .
now elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and her neighb@@ ours and her c@@ ou@@ sins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
and it came to pass, that on the e@@ igh@@ th day they came to circumci@@ se the child ; and they called him zachari@@ as, after the name of his father .
and his mother answered and said, not so ; but he shall be called john .
and they said unto her, there is none of thy kind@@ red that is called by this name .
and they made signs to his father, how he would have him called .
and he asked for a writing ta@@ ble, and wro@@ te, saying, his name is john . and they marvelled all .
and his mouth was opened immediate@@ ly, and his tongue loo@@ sed, and he spake, and p@@ raised god .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were no@@ ised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hear@@ ts, saying, what manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the lord was with him .
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost, and prophesi@@ ed, saying ,
blessed be the lord god of israel ; for he hath visi@@ ted and re@@ dee@@ med his people ,
and hath raised up an hor@@ n of salvation for us in the house of his servant david ;
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began :
that we should be saved from our enemi@@ es, and from the hand of all that hate us ;
to perfor@@ m the mercy promi@@ sed to our fathers, and to remember his holy co@@ ven@@ ant ;
the oa@@ th which he s@@ ware to our father abraham ,
that he would gran@@ t unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemi@@ es might serve him without fear ,
in ho@@ lin@@ ess and righteousness before him, all the days of our life .
and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways ;
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
through the ten@@ der mercy of our god ; where@@ by the da@@ y@@ sp@@ ring from on high hath visi@@ ted us ,
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to gu@@ ide our feet into the way of peace .
and the child gre@@ w, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deser@@ ts till the day of his she@@ wing unto israel .
and it came to pass in those days, that there went out a de@@ cre@@ e from caesar au@@ gu@@ st@@ us that all the world should be ta@@ xed .

and all went to be ta@@ x@@ ed, every one into his own city .
and joseph also went up from galilee, out of the city of nazareth, into judaea, unto the city of david, which is called bethlehe@@ m ; 
to be ta@@ xed with mary his es@@ p@@ ou@@ sed wife, being great with child .
and so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accompli@@ shed that she should be delivered .
and she brought forth her fir@@ st@@ born son, and wrapped him in s@@ wa@@ d@@ d@@ ling clothes, and laid him in a man@@ ger ; because there was no room for them in the in@@ n .
and there were in the same country shepher@@ ds abi@@ ding in the field, ke@@ ep@@ ing watch over their flo@@ ck by night .
and, lo, the angel of the lord came upon them, and the glory of the lord sh@@ one round about them : and they were sore afraid .
and the angel said unto them, fear not : for, behold, i bring you good tid@@ ings of great jo@@ y, which shall be to all people .
for unto you is born this day in the city of david a sa@@ vi@@ our, which is christ the lord .
and this shall be a sign unto you ; ye shall find the ba@@ be wrapped in s@@ wa@@ d@@ d@@ ling clothes, lying in a man@@ ger .
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho@@ st praising god, and saying ,
glory to god in the hig@@ he@@ st, and on earth peace, good will toward men .
and it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepher@@ ds said one to another, let us now go even unto bethlehe@@ m, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the lord hath made known unto us .
and they came with ha@@ ste@@ , and found mary, and joseph, and the ba@@ be lying in a man@@ ger .
and when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepher@@ ds .
but mary kept all these things, and pon@@ dered them in her heart .
and the shepher@@ ds returned, glori@@ fying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and se@@ en, as it was told unto them .
and when ei@@ ght days were accompli@@ shed for the circumci@@ sing of the child, his name was called jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was con@@ cei@@ ved in the womb .
and when the days of her puri@@ fi@@ cation according to the law of moses were accompli@@ shed, they brought him to jerusalem, to present him to the lord ;

and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord, a pa@@ ir of tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ves, or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons .
and, behold, there was a man in jerusalem, whose name was si@@ me@@ on ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out, wai@@ ting for the con@@ so@@ lation of israel : and the holy ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the lord 's christ .
and he came by the spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law ,
then took he him up in his ar@@ ms, and blessed god, and said ,
lord, now le@@ tt@@ est thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word :
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
a light to li@@ ghte@@ n the gentiles, and the glory of thy people israel .
and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
and si@@ me@@ on blessed them, and said unto mary his mother, behold, this child is set for the fall and ri@@ sing again of many in israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
that the though@@ ts of many hearts may be revealed .
and there was one an@@ na, a prophe@@ t@@ es@@ s, the daughter of p@@ han@@ u@@ e@@ l, of the tri@@ be of a@@ se@@ r : she was of a great a@@ ge, and had li@@ ved with an husband seven years from her virg@@ in@@ ity ;
and she was a widow of about four@@ scor@@ e and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served god with fast@@ ings and pray@@ ers night and day .
and she coming in that in@@ stan@@ t gave than@@ ks likewise unto the lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for re@@ dem@@ p@@ tion in jerusalem .
and when they had perfor@@ med all things according to the law of the lord, they returned into galilee, to their own city nazareth .
and the child gre@@ w, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom : and the grace of god was upon him .
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
and when he was twelve years old, they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
and when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem ; and joseph and his mother knew not of it .
but they, sup@@ pos@@ ing him to have been in the comp@@ an@@ y, went a day 's journe@@ y ; and they sought him among their kin@@ s@@ fol@@ k and ac@@ qua@@ int@@ ance .
and when they found him not, they turned back again to jerusalem, seeking him .
and it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doc@@ tor@@ s, both hearing them, and as@@ king them questi@@ ons .
and all that heard him were astonished at his under@@ standing and answer@@ s .
and when they saw him, they were amaz@@ ed : and his mother said unto him, son, why hast thou thus de@@ al@@ t with us ? behold, thy father and i have sought thee sorrow@@ ing .
and he said unto them, how is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that i must be about my father 's bu@@ sin@@ ess ?
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
and he went down with them, and came to nazareth, and was sub@@ ject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
and jesus incre@@ ased in wisdom and sta@@ tu@@ re, and in fav@@ our with god and man .
now in the fif@@ te@@ en@@ th year of the re@@ ign of ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us caesar, pon@@ ti@@ us pilate being governor of judaea, and herod being tetrar@@ ch of galilee, and his brother philip tetrar@@ ch of i@@ tu@@ rae@@ a and of the region of tra@@ ch@@ oni@@ ti@@ s, and ly@@ s@@ ani@@ as the tetrar@@ ch of abi@@ len@@ e ,
an@@ n@@ as and caiapha@@ s being the high priests, the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness .
and he came into all the country about jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his pa@@ th@@ s straight .
every v@@ al@@ le@@ y shall be fi@@ lled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the c@@ roo@@ ked shall be made strai@@ ght, and the r@@ ough ways shall be made s@@ mo@@ o@@ th ;
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god .
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, o generation of vi@@ pers, who hath war@@ ned you to flee from the wra@@ th to come ?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repen@@ tan@@ ce, and begin not to say within yourselves, we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you, that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
and now also the a@@ x@@ e is laid unto the roo@@ t of the tre@@ es : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire .
and the people asked him, saying, what shall we do then ?
he answe@@ reth and saith unto them, he that hath two coa@@ ts, let him im@@ part to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise .
then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, master, what shall we do ?
and he said unto them, ex@@ ac@@ t no more than that which is appointed you .
and the soldiers likewise de@@ man@@ ded of him, saying, and what shall we do ? and he said unto them, do viol@@ ence to no man, neither accuse any fal@@ se@@ ly ; and be cont@@ ent with your wa@@ ges .
and as the people were in expe@@ c@@ tation, and all men mu@@ sed in their hearts of john, whether he were the christ, or not ;
john answered, saying unto them all, i indeed baptize you with water ; but one migh@@ ti@@ er than i cometh, the la@@ t@@ che@@ t of whose shoes i am not worthy to un@@ loose : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire :
whose fa@@ n is in his hand, and he will through@@ ly pur@@ ge his flo@@ or, and will gather the wheat into his gar@@ ner ; but the cha@@ f@@ f he will bur@@ n with fire un@@ quen@@ cha@@ ble .
and many other things in his exhor@@ tation preached he unto the people .
but herod the tetrar@@ ch, being repro@@ ved by him for herodias his brother philip 's wife, and for all the evi@@ ls which herod had done ,
added yet this above all, that he shut up john in prison .
now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that jesus also being baptized, and pray@@ ing, the heaven was opened ,
and the holy ghost descen@@ ded in a bo@@ di@@ ly sha@@ pe like a do@@ ve upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, thou art my beloved son ; in thee i am well pleased .
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of a@@ ge, being the son of joseph, which was the son of hel@@ i ,
which was the son of mat@@ that, which was the son of le@@ vi@@ , which was the son of me@@ l@@ chi@@ , which was the son of j@@ an@@ na, which was the son of joseph ,
which was the son of mat@@ ta@@ thi@@ as, which was the son of a@@ mo@@ s, which was the son of nau@@ m, which was the son of es@@ li@@ , which was the son of na@@ g@@ ge ,
which was the son of ma@@ a@@ th, which was the son of mat@@ ta@@ thi@@ as, which was the son of se@@ me@@ i, which was the son of joseph, which was the son of jud@@ a ,
which was the son of jo@@ an@@ na, which was the son of r@@ he@@ sa@@ , which was the son of z@@ or@@ o@@ ba@@ be@@ l, which was the son of sa@@ la@@ thie@@ l, which was the son of n@@ er@@ i ,
which was the son of me@@ l@@ chi@@ , which was the son of ad@@ di@@ , which was the son of co@@ sa@@ m, which was the son of el@@ mo@@ da@@ m, which was the son of er ,
which was the son of jo@@ se, which was the son of e@@ lie@@ z@@ er, which was the son of jor@@ i@@ m, which was the son of mat@@ that, which was the son of le@@ v@@ i ,
which was the son of si@@ me@@ on, which was the son of juda@@ , which was the son of joseph, which was the son of jon@@ an, which was the son of eli@@ a@@ ki@@ m ,
which was the son of me@@ le@@ a, which was the son of men@@ an, which was the son of mat@@ ta@@ tha, which was the son of nathan@@ , which was the son of david ,
which was the son of jes@@ se, which was the son of obe@@ d, which was the son of boo@@ z@@ , which was the son of sal@@ mon, which was the son of na@@ as@@ son ,
which was the son of a@@ min@@ a@@ da@@ b, which was the son of ar@@ am, which was the son of es@@ ro@@ m, which was the son of pha@@ res, which was the son of jud@@ a ,
which was the son of jaco@@ b, which was the son of isaac, which was the son of abraham, which was the son of th@@ ar@@ a, which was the son of na@@ ch@@ or ,

and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness ,
being forty days temp@@ ted of the devil . and in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were en@@ ded, he afterward hun@@ ge@@ red .
and the devil said unto him, if thou be the son of god, command this stone that it be made bread .
and jesus answered him, saying, it is written, that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of god .
and the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the king@@ do@@ ms of the world in a mo@@ ment of time .
and the devil said unto him, all this power will i give thee, and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever i will i give it .
if thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine .
and jesus answered and said unto him, get thee behind me, satan : for it is written, thou shalt worship the lord thy god, and him only shalt thou serve .
and he brought him to jerusalem, and set him on a p@@ in@@ nac@@ le of the temple, and said unto him, if thou be the son of god, cast thyself down from hence :
for it is written, he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee :
and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou d@@ as@@ h thy foot against a stone .
and jesus answering said unto him, it is said, thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
and when the devil had en@@ ded all the temp@@ tation, he departed from him for a season .
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all .
and he came to nazareth, where he had been brought up : and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read .
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias . and when he had opened the boo@@ k, he found the place where it was written ,
the spirit of the lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the bro@@ k@@ en@@ hear@@ ted, to preach deli@@ ver@@ ance to the ca@@ pti@@ ves, and re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing of sight to the blind, to set at liber@@ ty them that are b@@ ru@@ ised ,
to preach the ac@@ ce@@ p@@ table year of the lord .
and he clo@@ sed the boo@@ k, and he gave it again to the mini@@ ster, and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fast@@ ened on him .
and he began to say unto them, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
and all bare him witness, and wondered at the gra@@ ci@@ ous words which proce@@ e@@ ded out of his mouth . and they said, is not this joseph 's son ?
and he said unto them, ye will sure@@ ly say unto me this pro@@ ver@@ b, physici@@ an, heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum, do also here in thy country .
and he said, verily i say unto you, no prophet is ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted in his own country .
but i tell you of a truth, many widows were in israel in the days of eli@@ as, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great fa@@ mine was throughout all the land ;
but unto none of them was elias sen@@ t, save unto sa@@ rep@@ ta@@ , a city of sidon, unto a woman that was a widow .
and many le@@ pers were in israel in the time of eli@@ se@@ us the prophet ; and none of them was clean@@ sed, sa@@ ving na@@ a@@ man the syri@@ an .
and all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wra@@ th ,
and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was bui@@ lt, that they might cast him down hea@@ d@@ long .
but he pas@@ sing through the midst of them went his way ,
and came down to capernaum, a city of galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
and in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice ,
saying, let us alone ; what have we to do with thee, thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou art ; the holy one of god .
and jesus rebuked him, saying, hold thy peace, and come out of him . and when the devil had th@@ ro@@ wn him in the midst, he came out of him, and hu@@ r@@ t him not .
and they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, what a word is this ! for with authority and power he comman@@ deth the unclean spiri@@ ts, and they come out .
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
and he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into simon 's house . and simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
and he stood over her, and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
now when the sun was sett@@ ing, all they that had any sick with divers disea@@ ses brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them .
and devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, thou art christ the son of god . and he rebu@@ king them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was christ .
and when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him, and came unto him, and sta@@ yed him, that he should not depart from them .
and he said unto them, i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also : for therefore am i sent .
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee .
and it came to pass, that, as the people pre@@ ssed upon him to hear the word of god, he stood by the la@@ ke of gen@@ ne@@ sa@@ re@@ t ,
and saw two shi@@ ps standing by the la@@ ke : but the fishe@@ r@@ men were gone out of them, and were was@@ hing their ne@@ ts .
and he entered into one of the shi@@ p@@ s, which was simon 's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . and he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship .
now when he had left spea@@ king, he said unto simon, laun@@ ch out into the de@@ ep, and let down your ne@@ ts for a dra@@ ught .
and simon answering said unto him, master, we have to@@ i@@ led all the night, and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net .
and when they had this done, they in@@ clo@@ sed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
and they beck@@ oned unto their par@@ t@@ n@@ ers, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them . and they came, and filled both the shi@@ p@@ s, so that they began to sin@@ k .
when simon peter saw it, he fell down at jesus ' kne@@ es, saying, depart from me ; for i am a sin@@ ful man, o lord .
for he was astoni@@ shed, and all that were with him, at the dra@@ ught of the fishes which they had taken :
and so was also james, and john, the sons of zebedee, which were par@@ t@@ ners with simon . and jesus said unto simon, fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt ca@@ tch men .
and when they had brought their shi@@ ps to land, they for@@ so@@ ok all, and followed him .
and it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of le@@ pro@@ sy : who seeing jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, lord, if thou wil@@ t, thou canst make me clean .
and he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, i will : be thou clean . and immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy departed from him .
and he charged him to tell no man : but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cle@@ ans@@ ing, according as moses comman@@ ded, for a testimony unto them .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmi@@ ties .
and he with@@ drew himself into the wilderness, and prayed .
and it came to pass on a certain day, as he was tea@@ chi@@ ng, that there were pharisees and doc@@ tor@@ s of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of galilee, and judaea, and jerusalem : and the power of the lord was present to heal them .
and, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a pal@@ sy : and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him .
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the house@@ to@@ p, and let him down through the ti@@ ling with his c@@ ou@@ ch into the midst before jesus .
and when he saw their faith, he said unto him, man, thy sins are forgiven thee .
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reas@@ on, saying, who is this which speaketh blasphe@@ mi@@ es ? who can forgive sins, but god alone ?
but when jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, what reason ye in your hearts ?
whether is easi@@ er, to say, thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say, rise up and walk ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, i say unto thee, arise, and take up thy c@@ ou@@ ch, and go into thine house .
and immediately he rose up before them, and took up that where@@ on he la@@ y, and departed to his own house, glori@@ fying god .
and they were all amazed, and they glorified god, and were filled with fe@@ ar, saying, we have seen stran@@ ge things to day .
and after these things he went forth, and saw a publican@@ , named le@@ vi@@ , sitting at the recei@@ pt of custom : and he said unto him, follow me .
and he left all, rose up, and followed him .
and le@@ v@@ i made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
and jesus answering said unto them, they that are whole need not a physici@@ an ; but they that are sick .
i came not to call the righte@@ ous, but sinners to repentance .
and they said unto him, why do the disciples of john fast of@@ t@@ en, and make pray@@ ers, and likewise the disciples of the pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
and he said unto them, can ye make the children of the bride@@ cha@@ mber fa@@ st, while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days .
and he spake also a parable unto them ; no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if o@@ ther@@ wise, then both the new ma@@ keth a ren@@ t, and the piece that was taken out of the new agre@@ eth not with the old .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will bur@@ st the bott@@ les, and be spi@@ lled, and the bottles shall perish .
but new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are pre@@ served .
no man also having drun@@ k old wine straightway desi@@ reth new : for he saith, the old is better .
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fie@@ l@@ ds ; and his disciples plu@@ cked the ears of cor@@ n, and did eat, ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing them in their hands .
and certain of the pharisees said unto them, why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
and jesus answering them said, have ye not read so much as this, what david did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him ;
how he went into the house of god, and did take and eat the she@@ w@@ bread, and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
and he said unto them, that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
and it came to pass also on another sabba@@ th, that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
and the scribes and pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accu@@ sa@@ tion against him .
but he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, rise up, and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
then said jesus unto them, i will ask you one thing ; is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil ? to save life, or to destroy it ?
and looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, stret@@ ch forth thy hand . and he did so : and his hand was re@@ sto@@ red whole as the other .
and they were filled with ma@@ dness ; and comm@@ un@@ ed one with another what they might do to jesus .
and it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to god .
and when it was day, he called unto him his disciples : and of them he cho@@ se twelve, whom also he named apostles ;
simon, and andrew his brother, james and john, philip and bar@@ tho@@ lo@@ me@@ w ,
mat@@ the@@ w and thomas, james the son of al@@ pha@@ eus, and simon called ze@@ lo@@ tes ,
and judas the brother of james, and judas iscariot, which also was the t@@ rai@@ t@@ or .
and he came down with them, and stood in the pla@@ in, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem, and from the sea coa@@ st of tyre and sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their disea@@ ses ;
and they that were ve@@ xed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
and the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went vir@@ tu@@ e out of him, and healed them all .
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, blessed be ye poor : for you@@ rs is the kingdom of god .
blessed are ye that hun@@ ger now : for ye shall be filled . blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall lau@@ gh .
blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall se@@ para@@ te you from their comp@@ an@@ y, and shall repro@@ a@@ ch you, and cast out your name as evil, for the son of man 's sake .
rejoice ye in that day, and lea@@ p for joy : for, behold, your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
but woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your con@@ so@@ lation .
woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hun@@ ger . woe unto you that lau@@ gh now ! for ye shall mour@@ n and weep .
woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
but i say unto you which hear, love your enemi@@ es, do good to them which hate you ,
bles@@ s them that cur@@ se you, and pray for them which despi@@ te@@ fully use you .
and unto him that smi@@ teth thee on the one che@@ e@@ k offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy clo@@ a@@ k forbid not to take thy co@@ at also .
give to every man that as@@ keth of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
and as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise .
for if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
and if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
and if ye l@@ end to them of whom ye hope to recei@@ ve, what thank have ye ? for sinners also l@@ end to sin@@ n@@ ers, to receive as much again .
but love ye your enemi@@ es, and do good, and len@@ d, ho@@ p@@ ing for nothing again ; and your reward shall be grea@@ t, and ye shall be the children of the highest : for he is k@@ ind unto the un@@ than@@ k@@ ful and to the evil .
be ye therefore mer@@ ci@@ ful, as your father also is mer@@ ci@@ ful .
judge not, and ye shall not be judged : condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned : forgi@@ ve, and ye shall be forgiven :
gi@@ ve, and it shall be given unto you ; good measu@@ re, pre@@ ssed down, and shaken together, and run@@ ning o@@ ver, shall men give into your bo@@ som . for with the same measure that ye me@@ te with@@ al it shall be measu@@ red to you again .
and he spake a parable unto them, can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the di@@ tch ?
the disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
and why beho@@ ldest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye, but percei@@ vest not the be@@ am that is in thine own eye ?
e@@ ither how canst thou say to thy brother, brother, let me pu@@ ll out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beho@@ ldest not the be@@ am that is in thine own eye ? thou hypocri@@ te, cast out first the be@@ am out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see cle@@ ar@@ ly to pu@@ ll out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye .
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrup@@ t fruit ; neither doth a corrup@@ t tree bring forth good fruit .
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather fi@@ g@@ s, nor of a bra@@ mb@@ le bu@@ sh gather they gra@@ pes .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
and why call ye me, lord, lord, and do not the things which i say ?
whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, i will shew you to whom he is like :
he is like a man which built an house, and di@@ g@@ ged de@@ ep, and laid the founda@@ tion on a rock : and when the f@@ lood arose, the st@@ rea@@ m beat ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly upon that house, and could not sha@@ ke it : for it was f@@ ounded upon a rock .
but he that hea@@ reth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a founda@@ tion built an house upon the earth ; against which the st@@ rea@@ m did beat ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly, and immediately it fell ; and the ru@@ in of that house was great .
now when he had en@@ ded all his sayings in the au@@ di@@ ence of the people, he entered into capernaum .
and a certain centurion 's servant, who was dea@@ r unto him, was sick, and ready to die .
and when he heard of jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the jews, besee@@ ching him that he would come and heal his servant .
and when they came to jesus, they besought him in@@ stan@@ tly, saying, that he was worthy for whom he should do this :
for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue .
then jesus went with them . and when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, lord, trouble not thyself : for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my ro@@ of :
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed .
for i also am a man set under author@@ i@@ ty, having under me soldiers, and i say unto one, go, and he goeth ; and to another, come, and he cometh ; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth it .
when jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, i say unto you, i have not found so great faith, no, not in israel .
and they that were sen@@ t, retur@@ ning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick .
and it came to pass the day af@@ ter, that he went into a city called na@@ in ; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people .
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
and when the lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, weep not .
and he came and touched the bi@@ er : and they that bare him stood still . and he said, young man, i say unto thee, arise .
and he that was dead sat up, and began to speak . and he delivered him to his mother .
and there came a fear on all : and they glorified god, saying, that a great prophet is risen up among us ; and, that god hath visi@@ ted his people .
and this ru@@ m@@ our of him went forth throughout all judaea, and throughout all the region round about .
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things .
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus, saying, art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
when the men were come unto him, they said, john baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
and in that same hour he cu@@ red many of their infirmi@@ ties and pla@@ gu@@ es, and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
then jesus answering said unto them, go your way, and tell john what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see, the lame wal@@ k, the le@@ pers are clean@@ sed, the dea@@ f hear, the dead are rai@@ sed, to the poor the gospel is preached .
and blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me .
and when the mes@@ sen@@ g@@ ers of john were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning john, what went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a re@@ ed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in so@@ ft raiment ? behold, they which are g@@ or@@ ge@@ ously ap@@ pa@@ re@@ lled, and live deli@@ ca@@ te@@ ly, are in kings ' cour@@ ts .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea, i say unto you, and much more than a prophet .
this is he, of whom it is written, behold, i send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee .
for i say unto you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he .
and all the people that heard him, and the publican@@ s, justified god, being baptized with the baptism of john .
but the pharisees and lawy@@ ers reje@@ cted the counsel of god against themselves, being not baptized of him .
and the lord said, whereunto then shall i li@@ ken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
they are like unto children sitting in the marke@@ t@@ place, and calling one to another, and saying, we have pi@@ ped unto you, and ye have not d@@ an@@ ced ; we have mour@@ ned to you, and ye have not wept .
for john the baptist came neither ea@@ ting bread nor drin@@ king wine ; and ye say, he hath a devil .
the son of man is come ea@@ ting and drin@@ king ; and ye say, behold a g@@ lu@@ tt@@ on@@ ous man, and a win@@ e@@ bi@@ b@@ b@@ er, a fri@@ end of publicans and sinners !
but wisdom is justified of all her children .
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the pharisee 's house, and sat down to meat .
and, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sin@@ n@@ er, when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee 's house, brought an a@@ lab@@ as@@ ter bo@@ x of ointment ,
and stood at his feet behind him weep@@ ing, and began to wash his feet with te@@ ar@@ s, and did wi@@ pe them with the hai@@ rs of her head, and kis@@ sed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment .
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, this man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that tou@@ che@@ th him : for she is a sinner .
and jesus answering said unto him, simon, i have some@@ what to say unto thee . and he saith, master, say on .
there was a certain cre@@ di@@ t@@ or which had two deb@@ tor@@ s : the one o@@ wed five hundred pen@@ ce, and the other fif@@ ty .
and when they had nothing to pa@@ y, he f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly for@@ gave them both . tell me therefore, which of them will love him most ?
simon answered and said, i suppo@@ se that he, to whom he for@@ gave most . and he said unto him, thou hast ri@@ ght@@ ly judged .
and he turned to the woman, and said unto simon, se@@ est thou this woman ? i entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with te@@ ar@@ s, and wi@@ ped them with the hai@@ rs of her head .
thou gavest me no kis@@ s : but this woman since the time i came in hath not ce@@ ased to kis@@ s my feet .
my head with oil thou didst not anoin@@ t : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
wherefore i say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgi@@ ven, the same loveth little .
and he said unto her, thy sins are forgiven .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, who is this that for@@ giveth sins also ?
and he said to the woman, thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
and it came to pass after@@ ward, that he went throughout every city and villa@@ ge, preaching and she@@ wing the glad tid@@ ings of the kingdom of god : and the twelve were with him ,
and certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmi@@ ties, mary called magdalene, out of whom went seven devils ,
and jo@@ an@@ na the wife of ch@@ u@@ z@@ a herod 's ste@@ ward, and su@@ san@@ na, and many others, which ministered unto him of their sub@@ st@@ ance .
and when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable :
a so@@ wer went out to sow his seed : and as he so@@ wed, some fell by the way side ; and it was tro@@ d@@ den down, and the fowls of the air dev@@ oured it .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sp@@ run@@ g up, it withered away, because it la@@ cked mo@@ i@@ stu@@ re .
and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sp@@ ran@@ g up with it, and cho@@ ked it .
and other fell on good ground, and sp@@ ran@@ g up, and bare fruit an hundre@@ d@@ fold . and when he had said these things, he cried, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear .
and his disciples asked him, saying, what might this parable be ?
and he said, unto you it is given to know the my@@ ster@@ i@@ es of the kingdom of god : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand .
now the parable is this : the seed is the word of god .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hear@@ ts, lest they should believe and be saved .
they on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy ; and these have no roo@@ t, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away .
and that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are cho@@ ked with ca@@ res and ri@@ ches and ple@@ asu@@ res of this life, and bring no fruit to perfe@@ ction .
but that on the good ground are they, which in an hon@@ est and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with pa@@ ti@@ ence .
no man, when he hath li@@ gh@@ ted a can@@ dle, cove@@ reth it with a ves@@ sel@@ , or putteth it under a bed ; but se@@ tteth it on a can@@ d@@ les@@ ti@@ ck, that they which enter in may see the light .
for nothing is secre@@ t, that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hi@@ d, that shall not be known and come abroad .
take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever ha@@ th, to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he see@@ meth to have .
then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the pre@@ ss .
and it was told him by certain which said, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee .
and he answered and said unto them, my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god, and do it .
now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them, let us go over unto the other side of the la@@ ke . and they laun@@ ched forth .
but as they sailed he fell asle@@ ep : and there came down a stor@@ m of wind on the la@@ ke ; and they were filled with water, and were in je@@ o@@ par@@ dy .
and they came to him, and a@@ wo@@ ke him, saying, master, master, we perish . then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the ra@@ ging of the water : and they cea@@ sed, and there was a cal@@ m .
and he said unto them, where is your faith ? and they being afraid won@@ de@@ red, saying one to another, what manner of man is this ! for he comman@@ deth even the winds and water, and they obey him .
and they ar@@ ri@@ ved at the country of the ga@@ da@@ ren@@ es, which is over against galilee .
and when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the to@@ mbs .
when he saw jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, what have i to do with thee, jesus, thou son of god most high ? i besee@@ ch thee, tor@@ ment me not .

and jesus asked him, saying, what is thy name ? and he said, le@@ gion : because many devils were entered into him .
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the de@@ ep .
and there was there an herd of many swine fee@@ ding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine : and the herd ran vio@@ len@@ tly down a ste@@ ep place into the la@@ ke, and were cho@@ ked .
when they that f@@ ed them saw what was done, they f@@ led, and went and told it in the city and in the country .
then they went out to see what was done ; and came to jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of jesus, clothe@@ d, and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
then the whole multitude of the country of the ga@@ da@@ re@@ ne@@ s round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship, and returned back again .
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but jesus sent him away, saying ,
return to thine own house, and shew how great things god hath done unto thee . and he went his way, and publi@@ shed throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him .
and it came to pass, that, when jesus was returned, the people gla@@ dly received him : for they were all wai@@ ting for him .
and, behold, there came a man named ja@@ i@@ ru@@ s, and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at jesus ' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house :
for he had one only daugh@@ ter, about twelve years of a@@ ge, and she lay a d@@ ying . but as he went the people thr@@ on@@ ged him .
and a woman having an is@@ su@@ e of blood twelve years, which had sp@@ ent all her living upon physici@@ ans, neither could be healed of any ,
came behind him, and touched the bor@@ der of his garment : and immediately her is@@ su@@ e of blood stan@@ ched .
and jesus said, who touched me ? when all deni@@ ed, peter and they that were with him said, master, the multitude thr@@ ong thee and pre@@ ss thee, and sayest thou, who touched me ?
and jesus said, some@@ body hath touched me : for i perceive that vir@@ tu@@ e is gone out of me .
and when the woman saw that she was not hi@@ d, she came tremb@@ ling, and fal@@ ling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately .
and he said unto her, daugh@@ ter, be of good comfor@@ t : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
while he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house, saying to him, thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the master .
but when jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, fear not : believe only, and she shall be made whole .
and when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save peter, and james, and john, and the father and the mother of the mai@@ den .
and all we@@ pt, and be@@ wai@@ led her : but he said, weep not ; she is not dead, but sle@@ e@@ peth .
and they lau@@ g@@ he@@ d him to scor@@ n, knowing that she was dead .
and he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, mai@@ d, arise .
and her spirit came again, and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
and her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cu@@ re disea@@ ses .
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god, and to heal the sick .
and he said unto them, take nothing for your journey, neither sta@@ ves, nor scri@@ p, neither bread, neither money ; neither have two coa@@ ts a@@ piece .
and whatsoever house ye enter in@@ to@@ , there abi@@ de, and thence depart .
and whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, sha@@ ke off the very du@@ st from your feet for a testimony against them .
and they departed, and went through the tow@@ ns, preaching the gospe@@ l, and healing every where .
now herod the tetrar@@ ch heard of all that was done by him : and he was per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed, because that it was said of so@@ me, that john was risen from the dead ;
and of so@@ me, that elias had appeared ; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and herod said, john have i be@@ hea@@ ded : but who is this, of whom i hear such things ? and he desired to see him .
and the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done . and he took them, and went aside private@@ ly into a desert place be@@ lon@@ ging to the city called bethsai@@ da .
and the people, when they knew it, followed him : and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of god, and healed them that had need of healing .
and when the day began to we@@ ar away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, send the multitude away, that they may go into the tow@@ ns and country round about, and lod@@ ge, and get vi@@ c@@ tu@@ al@@ s : for we are here in a desert place .
but he said unto them, give ye them to eat . and they said, we have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
for they were about five thousand men . and he said to his disciples, make them sit down by fif@@ ties in a company .
and they did so, and made them all sit down .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishe@@ s, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and bra@@ ke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat, and were all filled : and there was taken up of frag@@ ments that remained to them twelve baskets .
and it came to pass, as he was alone pray@@ ing, his disciples were with him : and he asked them, saying, whom say the people that i am ?
they answering said, john the baptist ; but some say, elias ; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again .
he said unto them, but whom say ye that i am ? peter answering said, the christ of god .
and he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
saying, the son of man must suffer many things, and be reje@@ cted of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be sla@@ in, and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross dai@@ ly, and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it .
for what is a man ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge@@ d, if he ga@@ in the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away ?
for whosoever shall be a@@ sha@@ med of me and of my words, of him shall the son of man be a@@ sha@@ med, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his father 's, and of the holy angels .
but i tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not ta@@ ste of death, till they see the kingdom of god .
and it came to pass about an ei@@ ght days after these sayings, he took peter and john and james, and went up into a mountain to pray .
and as he prayed, the f@@ as@@ hi@@ on of his coun@@ ten@@ ance was al@@ te@@ red, and his raiment was white and g@@ li@@ st@@ ering .
and, behold, there talked with him two men, which were moses and elias :
who appeared in glory, and spake of his de@@ ce@@ ase which he should accompli@@ sh at jerusalem .
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were a@@ wa@@ ke, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him .
and it came to pass, as they departed from him, peter said unto jesus, master, it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernac@@ les ; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias : not knowing what he said .
while he thus spake, there came a clou@@ d, and over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed them : and they feared as they entered into the c@@ loud .
and there came a voice out of the clou@@ d, saying, this is my beloved son : hear him .
and when the voice was pa@@ st, jesus was found alone . and they kept it clo@@ se, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hi@@ ll, much people met him .
and, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, master, i besee@@ ch thee, look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
and, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly cri@@ eth out ; and it tea@@ reth him that he fo@@ a@@ meth again, and b@@ ru@@ is@@ ing him har@@ dly depar@@ teth from him .
and i besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
and jesus answering said, o faith@@ less and perver@@ se generation, how long shall i be with you, and suffer you ? bring thy son hither .
and as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and t@@ are him . and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father .
and they were all amaz@@ ed at the mighty power of god . but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did, he said unto his disciples ,
let these sayings sin@@ k down into your ears : for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
but they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
then there arose a reas@@ oning among them, which of them should be greatest .
and jesus, percei@@ ving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him ,
and said unto them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great .
and john answered and said, master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we for@@ ba@@ d him, because he follo@@ weth not with us .
and jesus said unto him, forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
and it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem ,
and sent mes@@ sen@@ g@@ ers before his face : and they went, and entered into a village of the samarit@@ ans, to make ready for him .
and they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem .
and when his disciples james and john saw this, they said, lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and con@@ su@@ me them, even as elias did ?
but he turned, and rebuked them, and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
for the son of man is not come to destroy men 's li@@ ves, but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, lord, i will follow thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou goest .
and jesus said unto him, fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les, and bir@@ ds of the air have nes@@ ts ; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and he said unto another, follow me . but he said, lord, suffer me first to go and bu@@ ry my father .
jesus said unto him, let the dead bu@@ ry their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of god .
and another also said, lord, i will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them fa@@ re@@ well, which are at home at my house .
and jesus said unto him, no man, having put his hand to the p@@ lou@@ gh@@ , and looking ba@@ ck, is f@@ it for the kingdom of god .
after these things the lord appointed other se@@ ven@@ ty also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come .
therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is grea@@ t, but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the lord of the har@@ v@@ est, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
go your ways : behold, i send you forth as la@@ mbs among wol@@ ves .
carry neither pur@@ se, nor scri@@ p, nor shoes : and salu@@ te no man by the way .
and into whatsoever house ye en@@ ter, first say, peace be to this house .
and if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it : if not, it shall turn to you again .
and in the same house rema@@ in, ea@@ ting and drin@@ king such things as they give : for the labou@@ re@@ r is worthy of his hi@@ re . go not from house to house .
and into whatsoever city ye en@@ ter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you :
and heal the sick that are there@@ in, and say unto them, the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye en@@ ter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the stree@@ ts of the sa@@ me, and say ,
even the very du@@ st of your city, which c@@ lea@@ veth on us, we do wi@@ pe off against you : notwith@@ standing be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
but i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for so@@ dom, than for that city .
woe unto thee, ch@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ in ! woe unto thee, bethsai@@ da ! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while a@@ go rep@@ ente@@ d, sitting in sa@@ ck@@ clo@@ th and as@@ he@@ s .
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sid@@ on at the judgment, than for you .
and thou, capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell .
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despi@@ seth you despi@@ seth me ; and he that despi@@ seth me despi@@ seth him that sent me .
and the se@@ ven@@ ty returned again with jo@@ y, saying, lord, even the devils are sub@@ ject unto us through thy name .
and he said unto them, i beheld satan as light@@ ning fall from heaven .
behold, i give unto you power to t@@ read on ser@@ pen@@ ts and scor@@ pi@@ ons, and over all the power of the ene@@ my : and nothing shall by any means hu@@ r@@ t you .
notwith@@ standing in this rejoice not, that the spirits are sub@@ ject unto you ; but rather rejoi@@ ce, because your na@@ mes are written in heaven .
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, i thank thee, o father, lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and p@@ ru@@ den@@ t, and hast revealed them unto ba@@ bes : even so, father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
all things are delivered to me of my father : and no man knoweth who the son is, but the father ; and who the father is, but the son, and he to whom the son will reve@@ al him .
and he turned him unto his disciples, and said private@@ ly, blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
for i tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them .
and, behold, a certain law@@ ye@@ r stood up, and temp@@ ted him, saying, master, what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
he said unto him, what is written in the law ? how rea@@ dest thou ?
and he answering said, thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy streng@@ th, and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
and he said unto him, thou hast answered right : this do, and thou shalt live .
but he, willing to justi@@ fy himself, said unto jesus, and who is my neighbour ?
and jesus answering said, a certain man went down from jerusalem to jeri@@ cho@@ , and fell among thie@@ ves, which stri@@ pped him of his rai@@ ment, and w@@ ounded him, and departed, lea@@ ving him ha@@ l@@ f dead .
and by ch@@ ance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side .
and likewise a le@@ vi@@ te, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side .
but a certain samarit@@ an, as he journe@@ ye@@ d, came where he was : and when he saw him, he had compassion on him ,
and went to him, and bound up his w@@ oun@@ ds, p@@ our@@ ing in oil and win@@ e, and set him on his own bea@@ st, and brought him to an in@@ n, and took c@@ are of him .
and on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pen@@ ce, and gave them to the ho@@ st, and said unto him, take c@@ are of him ; and whatsoever thou sp@@ en@@ dest more, when i come again, i will re@@ pay thee .
which now of these thre@@ e, thin@@ kest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
and he said, he that shewed mercy on him . then said jesus unto him, go, and do thou likewise .
now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named martha received him into her house .
and she had a sister called mary, which also sat at jesus ' feet, and heard his word .
but martha was cu@@ mbered about much ser@@ v@@ ing, and came to him, and said, lord, dost thou not c@@ are that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
and jesus answered and said unto her, marth@@ a, marth@@ a, thou art ca@@ re@@ ful and troubled about many things :
but one thing is nee@@ d@@ ful : and mary hath chosen that good par@@ t, which shall not be taken away from her .
and it came to pass, that, as he was pra@@ ying in a certain place, when he cea@@ sed, one of his disciples said unto him, lord, teach us to pray, as john also taught his disciples .
and he said unto them, when ye pray, say, our father which art in heaven, ha@@ llo@@ wed be thy name . thy kingdom come . thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth .
give us day by day our daily bread .
and forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is inde@@ b@@ ted to us . and lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
and he said unto them, which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at mid@@ night, and say unto him, friend, l@@ end me three loaves ;
for a fri@@ end of mine in his journe@@ y is come to me, and i have nothing to set before him ?
and he from within shall answer and say, trouble me not : the door is now shu@@ t, and my children are with me in bed ; i cannot rise and give thee .
i say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity he will rise and give him as many as he nee@@ deth .
and i say unto you, as@@ k, and it shall be given you ; see@@ k, and ye shall find ; kno@@ ck, and it shall be opened unto you .
for every one that as@@ keth receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ keth it shall be opened .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fi@@ s@@ h, will he for a fi@@ sh give him a ser@@ p@@ ent ?
or if he shall ask an e@@ g@@ g, will he offer him a scor@@ pi@@ on ?
if ye then, being evil, know how to give good gif@@ ts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him ?
and he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb . and it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
but some of them said, he ca@@ ste@@ th out devils through beelzebu@@ b the chief of the devils .
and others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven .
but he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to deso@@ lation ; and a house divided against a house fal@@ leth .
if satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebu@@ b .
and if i by beelzebu@@ b cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your jud@@ ges .
but if i with the fing@@ er of god cast out devils, no doub@@ t the kingdom of god is come upon you .
when a strong man ar@@ med kee@@ peth his pala@@ ce, his goods are in peace :
but when a str@@ on@@ ger than he shall come upon him, and over@@ come him, he taketh from him all his ar@@ m@@ our wherein he tru@@ s@@ ted, and divi@@ deth his spo@@ i@@ ls .
he that is not with me is against me : and he that ga@@ there@@ th not with me scatte@@ reth .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he wal@@ keth through d@@ ry places, seeking rest ; and fin@@ ding no@@ n@@ e, he saith, i will return unto my house whence i came out .
and when he cometh, he findeth it swe@@ pt and gar@@ ni@@ shed .
then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in, and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the pa@@ ps which thou hast su@@ cked .
but he said, ye@@ a ra@@ ther, blessed are they that hear the word of god, and keep it .
and when the people were gathered thi@@ ck together, he began to say, this is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of jonas the prophet .
for as jonas was a sign unto the nin@@ evi@@ tes, so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
the qu@@ e@@ en of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them : for she came from the u@@ t@@ most par@@ ts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and, behold, a greater than solomon is here .
the men of nine@@ ve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of jonas ; and, behold, a greater than jonas is here .
no man, when he hath li@@ gh@@ ted a can@@ dle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bu@@ she@@ l, but on a can@@ d@@ les@@ ti@@ ck, that they which come in may see the light .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is s@@ ing@@ le, thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness .
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
if thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dar@@ k, the whole shall be full of light, as when the b@@ right shi@@ ning of a can@@ dle doth give thee light .
and as he spake, a certain pharisee besought him to d@@ ine with him : and he went in, and sat down to meat .
and when the pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before d@@ in@@ ner .
and the lord said unto him, now do ye pharisees make clean the out@@ side of the cup and the pla@@ tter ; but your in@@ ward part is full of ra@@ ven@@ ing and wi@@ c@@ ke@@ dness .
ye foo@@ ls, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
but rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and, behold, all things are clean unto you .
but woe unto you, pharisees ! for ye ti@@ the min@@ t and ru@@ e and all manner of he@@ r@@ b@@ s, and pass over judgment and the love of god : these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other un@@ done .
woe unto you, pharisees ! for ye love the up@@ per@@ most seats in the synagogues, and gree@@ t@@ ings in the marke@@ ts .
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye are as gra@@ ves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not a@@ ware of them .
then answered one of the lawy@@ ers, and said unto him, master, thus saying thou repro@@ ac@@ hest us also .
and he said, woe unto you also, ye lawy@@ ers ! for ye la@@ de men with bur@@ den@@ s grie@@ v@@ ous to be bor@@ n@@ e, and ye yourselves touch not the bur@@ den@@ s with one of your fing@@ ers .
woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulch@@ res of the prophets, and your fathers killed them .
truly ye bear witness that ye al@@ low the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulch@@ res .
therefore also said the wisdom of god, i will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the founda@@ tion of the world, may be required of this generation ;
from the blood of a@@ be@@ l unto the blood of zacharias which per@@ ished between the al@@ ta@@ r and the temple : verily i say unto you, it shall be required of this generation .
woe unto you, lawy@@ ers ! for ye have taken away the ke@@ y of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hin@@ dered .
and as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the pharisees began to ur@@ ge him ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly, and to pro@@ vo@@ ke him to speak of many things :
la@@ ying wait for him, and seeking to ca@@ tch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him .
in the mean time, when there were gathered together an in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able multitude of people, insomuch that they tro@@ de one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees, which is hypocri@@ sy .
for there is nothing cove@@ red, that shall not be revealed ; neither hi@@ d, that shall not be known .
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in clo@@ se@@ ts shall be pro@@ c@@ la@@ i@@ med upon the house@@ to@@ ps .
and i say unto you my frien@@ ds, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do .
but i will fore@@ war@@ n you whom ye shall fear : fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea, i say unto you, fear him .
are not five sp@@ ar@@ row@@ s sold for two far@@ things, and not one of them is for@@ gotten before god ?
but even the very hai@@ rs of your head are all nu@@ mbered . fear not therefore : ye are of more v@@ al@@ u@@ e than many sp@@ ar@@ row@@ s .
also i say unto you, whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god :
but he that deni@@ eth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god .
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphe@@ meth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven .
and when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistra@@ tes, and power@@ s, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer@@ , or what ye shall say :
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
and one of the company said unto him, master, speak to my brother, that he divi@@ de the inheritance with me .
and he said unto him, man, who made me a judge or a divi@@ der over you ?
and he said unto them, take he@@ ed, and beware of cove@@ tou@@ s@@ ness : for a man 's life consi@@ ste@@ th not in the abundance of the things which he posses@@ seth .
and he spake a parable unto them, saying, the ground of a certain rich man brought forth p@@ len@@ ti@@ fully :
and he thought within himself, saying, what shall i do, because i have no room where to bes@@ to@@ w my fruits ?
and he said, this will i do : i will pu@@ ll down my bar@@ ns, and build greater ; and there will i bes@@ to@@ w all my fruits and my goods .
and i will say to my soul, soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ea@@ se, eat, drin@@ k, and be mer@@ ry .
but god said unto him, thou foo@@ l, this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be, which thou hast pro@@ vi@@ ded ?
so is he that la@@ yeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward god .
and he said unto his disciples, therefore i say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat ; neither for the body, what ye shall put on .
the life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment .
consi@@ der the ra@@ ven@@ s : for they neither sow nor rea@@ p ; which neither have sto@@ re@@ house nor bar@@ n ; and god fee@@ deth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
and which of you with taking thought can add to his sta@@ ture one cu@@ b@@ it ?
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is lea@@ st, why take ye thought for the rest ?
consi@@ der the li@@ lie@@ s how they g@@ row : they to@@ il not, they sp@@ in not ; and yet i say unto you, that solomon in all his glory was not ar@@ ra@@ yed like one of these .
if then god so clo@@ the the gra@@ ss, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the o@@ ven ; how much more will he clo@@ the you, o ye of little faith ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drin@@ k, neither be ye of doub@@ t@@ ful mind .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
fear not, little flo@@ ck ; for it is your father 's good ple@@ asu@@ re to give you the kingdom .
se@@ ll that ye ha@@ ve, and give alms ; pro@@ vi@@ de yourselves ba@@ gs which wa@@ x not old, a treasure in the heavens that fai@@ leth not, where no thief ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ he@@ th, neither mo@@ th corrup@@ teth .
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also .
let your lo@@ ins be gir@@ ded about, and your li@@ gh@@ ts bur@@ ning ;
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and kno@@ c@@ ke@@ th, they may open unto him immediately .
blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find wat@@ ching : verily i say unto you, that he shall gi@@ rd himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them .
and if he shall come in the second wat@@ ch, or come in the third wat@@ ch, and find them so, blessed are those servants .
and this know, that if the goo@@ d@@ man of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have wat@@ che@@ d, and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
be ye therefore ready also : for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
then peter said unto him, lord, spea@@ kest thou this parable unto us, or even to all ?
and the lord said, who then is that faithful and wise ste@@ ward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his househo@@ ld, to give them their por@@ tion of meat in du@@ e season ?
blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do@@ ing .
of a truth i say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
but and if that servant say in his heart, my lord de@@ la@@ yeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the men@@ servants and mai@@ den@@ s, and to eat and drin@@ k, and to be drun@@ ken ;
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he loo@@ keth not for him, and at an hour when he is not a@@ wa@@ re, and will cut him in s@@ und@@ er, and will appoin@@ t him his por@@ tion with the unbelie@@ vers .
and that servant, which knew his lord 's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be be@@ ate@@ n with many stri@@ pes .
but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stri@@ p@@ es, shall be be@@ ate@@ n with few stri@@ pes . for unto whomsoever much is gi@@ ven, of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed mu@@ ch, of him they will ask the more .
i am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will i, if it be already kind@@ led ?
but i have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am i strai@@ t@@ ened till it be accompli@@ shed !
suppo@@ se ye that i am come to give peace on earth ? i tell you, nay ; but rather divi@@ sion :
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divi@@ ded, three against t@@ wo@@ , and two against three .
the father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father ; the mother against the daugh@@ ter, and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and he said also to the people, when ye see a c@@ loud rise out of the w@@ est, straightway ye say, there cometh a sho@@ wer ; and so it is .
and when ye see the south wind b@@ lo@@ w, ye say, there will be he@@ at ; and it cometh to pass .
ye hypocri@@ tes, ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sk@@ y and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not dis@@ cer@@ n this time ?
yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
when thou goest with thine ad@@ versa@@ ry to the magistra@@ te, as thou art in the way, give di@@ ligen@@ ce that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he ha@@ le thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer@@ , and the offi@@ ce@@ r cast thee into prison .
i tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast pa@@ id the very last mi@@ te .
there were present at that season some that told him of the galilae@@ ans, whose blood pilate had m@@ ing@@ led with their sacrifi@@ ces .
and jesus answering said unto them, suppo@@ se ye that these galilae@@ ans were sinners above all the galilae@@ ans, because they suffered such things ?
i tell you, nay : but, except ye repen@@ t, ye shall all likewise perish .
or those ei@@ ghte@@ en, upon whom the to@@ wer in si@@ lo@@ am fe@@ ll, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem ?
i tell you, nay : but, except ye repen@@ t, ye shall all likewise perish .
he spake also this parable ; a certain man had a fig tree plan@@ ted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit there@@ on, and found none .
then said he unto the d@@ re@@ s@@ se@@ r of his vineyard, behold, these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none : cut it down ; why cu@@ mbe@@ reth it the ground ?
and he answering said unto him, lord, let it alone this year also, till i shall di@@ g about it, and d@@ un@@ g it :
and if it bear fruit, well : and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down .
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
and, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmi@@ ty ei@@ ghte@@ en years, and was bo@@ wed together, and could in no wise lift up hersel@@ f .
and when jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmi@@ ty .
and he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made strai@@ ght, and glorified god .
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indi@@ g@@ nation, because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, there are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be hea@@ led, and not on the sabbath day .
the lord then answered him, and said, thou hypocri@@ te, doth not ea@@ ch one of you on the sabbath loose his o@@ x or his as@@ s from the st@@ all, and lead him away to wa@@ tering ?
and ought not this woman, being a daughter of abraham, whom satan hath b@@ ound, lo, these ei@@ ghte@@ en years, be loosed from this bon@@ d on the sabbath day ?
and when he had said these things, all his ad@@ versa@@ ri@@ es were a@@ sha@@ med : and all the people rejoiced for all the glori@@ ous things that were done by him .
then said he, unto what is the kingdom of god like ? and whereunto shall i re@@ semb@@ le it ?
it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard seed, which a man too@@ k, and cast into his gar@@ den ; and it gre@@ w, and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
and again he said, whereunto shall i li@@ ken the kingdom of god ?
it is like lea@@ ven, which a woman took and hid in three measu@@ res of me@@ al, till the whole was leavened .
and he went through the cities and villages, tea@@ chi@@ ng, and journe@@ ying toward jerusalem .
then said one unto him, lord, are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
stri@@ ve to enter in at the stra@@ it gate : for many, i say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able .
when on@@ ce the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to kno@@ ck at the door, saying, lord, lord, open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you, i know you not whence ye are :
then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten and drun@@ k in thy presen@@ ce, and thou hast taught in our stree@@ ts .
but he shall say, i tell you, i know you not whence ye are ; depart from me, all ye wor@@ k@@ ers of iniquity .
there shall be weeping and gnashing of te@@ eth, when ye shall see abraham, and isaac, and jaco@@ b, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of god, and you yourselves thrust out .
and they shall come from the ea@@ st, and from the w@@ est, and from the n@@ or@@ th, and from the sou@@ th, and shall sit down in the kingdom of god .
and, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last .
the same day there came certain of the pharisees, saying unto him, get thee out, and depart hence : for herod will kill thee .
and he said unto them, go ye, and tell that fo@@ x@@ , behold, i cast out devils, and i do cu@@ res to day and to morrow, and the third day i shall be perfe@@ cted .
nevertheless i must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem .
o jerusalem, jerusalem, which ki@@ l@@ lest the prophets, and ston@@ est them that are sent unto thee ; how of@@ ten would i have gathered thy children together, as a he@@ n doth gather her bro@@ od under her w@@ ings, and ye would not !
behold, your house is left unto you deso@@ la@@ te : and verily i say unto you, ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
and it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him .
and, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the d@@ ro@@ p@@ sy .
and jesus answering spake unto the lawy@@ ers and pharisees, saying, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
and they held their peace . and he took him, and healed him, and let him go ;
and answered them, saying, which of you shall have an as@@ s or an o@@ x fallen into a pi@@ t, and will not straightway pu@@ ll him out on the sabbath day ?
and they could not answer him again to these things .
and he put forth a parable to those which were bid@@ d@@ en, when he mar@@ ked how they cho@@ se out the chief roo@@ ms ; saying unto them .
when thou art bidden of any man to a wed@@ d@@ ing, sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honou@@ ra@@ ble man than thou be bidden of him ;
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, give this man place ; and thou begin with sha@@ me to take the lo@@ west room .
but when thou art bid@@ d@@ en, go and sit down in the lo@@ west room ; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, friend, go up hig@@ her : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
for whosoever exal@@ teth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hu@@ mb@@ leth himself shall be exalted .
then said he also to him that bade him, when thou ma@@ kest a d@@ in@@ ner or a sup@@ per, call not thy frien@@ ds, nor thy brethren, neither thy kin@@ s@@ men, nor thy rich neighb@@ ours ; lest they also bid thee again, and a re@@ com@@ pen@@ ce be made thee .
but when thou ma@@ kest a fea@@ st, call the po@@ or, the mai@@ med, the la@@ me, the blind :
and thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot re@@ com@@ pen@@ se thee : for thou shalt be re@@ com@@ pen@@ sed at the resurrection of the just .
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god .
then said he unto him, a certain man made a great sup@@ per, and bade many :
and sent his servant at sup@@ per time to say to them that were bid@@ d@@ en, come ; for all things are now ready .
and they all with one con@@ sent began to make ex@@ c@@ use . the first said unto him, i have bought a piece of ground, and i must needs go and see it : i pray thee have me ex@@ cu@@ sed .
and another said, i have bought five y@@ o@@ ke of o@@ x@@ en, and i go to pro@@ ve them : i pray thee have me ex@@ cu@@ sed .
and another said, i have mar@@ ried a wife, and therefore i cannot come .
so that servant came, and shewed his lord these things . then the master of the house being an@@ g@@ ry said to his servant, go out quick@@ ly into the stree@@ ts and lan@@ es of the city, and bring in hither the po@@ or, and the mai@@ med, and the ha@@ lt, and the blind .
and the servant said, lord, it is done as thou hast comman@@ ded, and yet there is room .
and the lord said unto the servant, go out into the high@@ ways and he@@ d@@ ges, and com@@ pe@@ l them to come in, that my house may be filled .
for i say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall ta@@ ste of my sup@@ per .
and there went great multitudes with him : and he turned, and said unto them ,
if any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and si@@ st@@ ers, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple .
and whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple .
for which of you, int@@ en@@ ding to build a to@@ wer@@ , si@@ tteth not down first, and coun@@ teth the co@@ st, whether he have suf@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent to fin@@ ish it ?
lest ha@@ p@@ ly, after he hath laid the founda@@ tion, and is not able to fin@@ ish it, all that behold it begin to mo@@ ck him ,
saying, this man began to bui@@ ld, and was not able to fin@@ ish .
or what king, going to make wa@@ r against another king, si@@ tteth not down first, and cons@@ ul@@ teth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with tw@@ en@@ ty thousand ?
or el@@ se, while the other is yet a great way off, he sen@@ deth an a@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ ge, and desi@@ reth con@@ di@@ tions of peace .
so like@@ wise, whosoever he be of you that for@@ sa@@ keth not all that he ha@@ th, he cannot be my disciple .
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his sa@@ v@@ our, wherewith shall it be seas@@ oned ?
it is neither f@@ it for the land, nor yet for the d@@ un@@ g@@ hill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear, let him hear .
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
and the pharisees and scribes murmu@@ red, saying, this man receiveth sin@@ n@@ ers, and eateth with them .
and he spake this parable unto them, saying ,
what man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the nine@@ ty and n@@ ine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lo@@ st, until he find it ?
and when he hath found it, he la@@ yeth it on his shou@@ ld@@ ers, rejoi@@ c@@ ing .
and when he cometh ho@@ me, he calleth together his friends and neighb@@ our@@ s, saying unto them, rejoice with me ; for i have found my sheep which was lost .
i say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that rep@@ ente@@ th, more than over nine@@ ty and n@@ ine just per@@ s@@ ons, which need no repentance .
e@@ ither what woman having ten pieces of sil@@ ver, if she lose one pie@@ ce, doth not light a can@@ dle, and swe@@ ep the house, and seek di@@ ligen@@ tly till she find it ?
and when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighb@@ ours together, saying, rejoice with me ; for i have found the piece which i had lost .
like@@ wise, i say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that rep@@ ente@@ th .
and he said, a certain man had two sons :
and the you@@ n@@ ger of them said to his father, father, give me the por@@ tion of goods that fal@@ leth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
and not many days after the you@@ n@@ ger son gathered all together, and took his journe@@ y into a far country, and there wa@@ sted his sub@@ st@@ ance with ri@@ o@@ t@@ ous living .
and when he had sp@@ ent all, there arose a mighty fa@@ mine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
and he went and jo@@ ined himself to a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of that country ; and he sent him into his fie@@ l@@ ds to fe@@ ed swine .
and he would fa@@ in have filled his be@@ l@@ ly with the hus@@ ks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
and when he came to himself, he said, how many hired servants of my father 's have bread en@@ ough and to spa@@ re, and i perish with hun@@ ger !
i will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, father, i have sin@@ ned against heaven, and before thee ,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and he arose, and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compas@@ sion, and ran@@ , and fell on his ne@@ ck, and kis@@ sed him .
and the son said unto him, father, i have sin@@ ned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
but the father said to his servants, bring forth the b@@ est ro@@ be, and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet :
and bring hither the fa@@ tted cal@@ f, and kill it ; and let us eat, and be mer@@ ry :
for this my son was dead, and is a@@ live again ; he was lo@@ st, and is found . and they began to be mer@@ ry .
now his el@@ der son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard mu@@ sick and d@@ an@@ c@@ ing .
and he called one of the servants, and asked what these things me@@ ant .
and he said unto him, thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fa@@ tted cal@@ f, because he hath received him sa@@ f@@ e and sound .
and he was an@@ gr@@ y, and would not go in : therefore came his father out, and int@@ rea@@ ted him .
and he answering said to his father, lo, these many years do i serve thee, neither transgre@@ ssed i at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a ki@@ d, that i might make mer@@ ry with my friends :
but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath dev@@ oured thy living with har@@ lo@@ ts, thou hast killed for him the fa@@ tted cal@@ f .
and he said unto him, son, thou art ever with me, and all that i have is thine .
it was meet that we should make mer@@ ry, and be glad : for this thy brother was dead, and is a@@ live again ; and was lo@@ st, and is found .
and he said also unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man, which had a ste@@ ward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wa@@ sted his goods .
and he called him, and said unto him, how is it that i hear this of thee ? give an ac@@ coun@@ t of thy ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship ; for thou mayest be no lon@@ ger ste@@ ward .
then the ste@@ ward said within himself, what shall i do ? for my lord taketh away from me the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship : i cannot di@@ g ; to be@@ g i am a@@ sha@@ med .
i am re@@ sol@@ ved what to do, that, when i am put out of the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship, they may receive me into their hou@@ ses .
so he called every one of his lord 's deb@@ tor@@ s unto him, and said unto the first, how much o@@ west thou unto my lord ?
and he said, an hundred measu@@ res of oil . and he said unto him, take thy bi@@ ll, and sit down quick@@ ly, and write fif@@ ty .
then said he to another, and how much o@@ west thou ? and he said, an hundred measu@@ res of wheat . and he said unto him, take thy bi@@ ll, and write four@@ scor@@ e .
and the lord com@@ men@@ ded the unjust ste@@ ward, because he had done wi@@ se@@ ly : for the children of this world are in their generation wi@@ se@@ r than the children of light .
and i say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the ma@@ m@@ mon of un@@ righteousness ; that, when ye fai@@ l, they may receive you into everlasting ha@@ bi@@ ta@@ tions .
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the un@@ righteous ma@@ m@@ mon, who will commit to your tru@@ st the true ri@@ ches ?
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's, who shall give you that which is your own ?
no servant can serve two masters : for e@@ ither he will hate the one, and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one, and despi@@ se the other . ye cannot serve god and ma@@ m@@ mon .
and the pharisees also, who were cove@@ tou@@ s, heard all these things : and they der@@ i@@ ded him .
and he said unto them, ye are they which justi@@ fy yourselves before men ; but god knoweth your hearts : for that which is high@@ ly es@@ te@@ e@@ med among men is abo@@ min@@ ation in the sight of god .
the law and the prophets were until john : since that time the kingdom of god is prea@@ che@@ d, and every man pre@@ s@@ seth into it .
and it is easi@@ er for heaven and earth to pass, than one ti@@ ttle of the law to fai@@ l .
whosoever putteth away his wife, and marri@@ eth another, committeth adultery : and whosoever marri@@ eth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
there was a certain rich man, which was clothed in pur@@ p@@ le and f@@ ine lin@@ en, and fa@@ red su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously every day :
and there was a certain beg@@ ga@@ r named lazar@@ us, which was laid at his ga@@ te, full of so@@ res ,
and desiring to be f@@ ed with the cru@@ mbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the do@@ gs came and li@@ cked his so@@ res .
and it came to pass, that the beg@@ ga@@ r di@@ ed, and was carried by the angels into abraham 's bo@@ som : the rich man also di@@ ed, and was bu@@ ried ;
and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in tor@@ ments, and seeth abraham afar off, and lazarus in his bo@@ som .
and he cried and said, father abraham, have mercy on me, and send lazar@@ us, that he may di@@ p the ti@@ p of his fing@@ er in water, and co@@ ol my tongue ; for i am tor@@ men@@ ted in this f@@ lame .
but abraham said, son, remember that thou in thy li@@ fe@@ time recei@@ ve@@ dst thy good things, and likewise lazarus evil things : but now he is comfor@@ ted, and thou art tor@@ men@@ ted .
and beside all this, between us and you there is a great g@@ ul@@ f fi@@ xed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence .
then he said, i pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father 's house :
for i have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of tor@@ ment .
abraham saith unto him, they have moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
and he said, na@@ y, father abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent .
and he said unto him, if they hear not moses and the prophets, neither will they be persua@@ ded, though one rose from the dead .
then said he unto the disciples, it is im@@ possible but that offen@@ ces will come : but woe unto him, through whom they come !
it were better for him that a mi@@ ll@@ stone were hanged about his ne@@ ck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones .
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother trespas@@ s against thee, rebu@@ ke him ; and if he repen@@ t, forgive him .
and if he trespas@@ s against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, i repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
and the apostles said unto the lord, in@@ crea@@ se our faith .
and the lord said, if ye had faith as a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard seed, ye might say unto this sy@@ ca@@ mine tree, be thou plu@@ cked up by the roo@@ t, and be thou plan@@ ted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
but which of you, having a servant p@@ lo@@ wing or fee@@ ding ca@@ tt@@ le, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say unto him, make ready wherewith i may s@@ up, and gi@@ rd thyself, and serve me, till i have eaten and drun@@ ken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? i tro@@ w not .
so likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, we are un@@ profi@@ table servants : we have done that which was our du@@ ty to do .
and it came to pass, as he went to jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee .
and as he entered into a certain villa@@ ge, there met him ten men that were le@@ pers, which stood afar off :
and they lifted up their voi@@ ces, and said, jesus, master, have mercy on us .
and when he saw them, he said unto them, go shew yourselves unto the priests . and it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cle@@ ans@@ ed .
and one of them, when he saw that he was hea@@ led, turned ba@@ ck, and with a loud voice glorified god ,
and fell down on his face at his feet, gi@@ ving him than@@ ks : and he was a samari@@ tan .
and jesus answering said, were there not ten cle@@ ans@@ ed ? but where are the n@@ ine ?
there are not found that returned to give glory to god, save this str@@ anger .
and he said unto him, arise, go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and when he was de@@ man@@ ded of the pharisees, when the kingdom of god should come, he answered them and said, the kingdom of god cometh not with ob@@ ser@@ vation :
neither shall they say, l@@ o here ! or, l@@ o there ! for, behold, the kingdom of god is within you .
and he said unto the disciples, the days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man, and ye shall not see it .
and they shall say to you, see here ; or, see there : go not after them, nor follow them .
for as the light@@ ning, that light@@ en@@ eth out of the one part under heaven, shi@@ ne@@ th unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the son of man be in his day .
but first must he suffer many things, and be reje@@ cted of this generation .
and as it was in the days of no@@ e, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man .
they did eat, they d@@ ran@@ k, they mar@@ ried wi@@ ves, they were given in marri@@ a@@ ge, until the day that no@@ e entered into the ar@@ k, and the f@@ lood came, and destro@@ yed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat, they d@@ ran@@ k, they b@@ ou@@ ght, they so@@ ld, they plan@@ ted, they build@@ ed ;
but the same day that lot went out of so@@ dom it ra@@ ined fire and bri@@ m@@ stone from heaven, and destro@@ yed them all .
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed .
in that day, he which shall be upon the house@@ to@@ p, and his stu@@ f@@ f in the house, let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back .
remember lot 's wife .
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall pre@@ serve it .
i tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left .
two women shall be g@@ rin@@ ding together ; the one shall be taken, and the other left .
two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken, and the other left .
and they answered and said unto him, whe@@ re, lord ? and he said unto them, wheresoever the body is, thither will the ea@@ g@@ les be gathered together .
and he spake a parable unto them to this en@@ d, that men ought always to pray, and not to fa@@ in@@ t ;
saying, there was in a city a judge, which feared not god, neither regar@@ ded man :
and there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him, saying, a@@ ven@@ ge me of mine ad@@ versa@@ ry .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself, though i fear not god, nor regar@@ d man ;
yet because this widow troub@@ leth me, i will a@@ ven@@ ge her, lest by her continu@@ al coming she we@@ ar@@ y me .
and the lord said, hear what the unjust judge saith .
and shall not god a@@ ven@@ ge his own ele@@ c@@ t, which c@@ ry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them ?
i tell you that he will a@@ ven@@ ge them spee@@ di@@ ly . nevertheless when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth ?
and he spake this parable unto certain which tru@@ sted in themselves that they were righte@@ ous, and despi@@ sed others :
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a pharise@@ e, and the other a publi@@ can .
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, god, i thank thee, that i am not as other men a@@ re, ex@@ tor@@ ti@@ on@@ ers, un@@ ju@@ st, adul@@ te@@ re@@ rs, or even as this publi@@ can .
i fast t@@ wi@@ ce in the week, i give ti@@ the@@ s of all that i posses@@ s .
and the publican@@ , standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his brea@@ st, saying, god be mer@@ ci@@ ful to me a sinner .
i tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exal@@ teth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hu@@ mb@@ leth himself shall be exalted .
and they brought unto him also in@@ f@@ an@@ ts, that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them .
but jesus called them unto him, and said, suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
verily i say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
and a certain ruler asked him, saying, good master, what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
and jesus said unto him, why cal@@ lest thou me good ? none is good, save one, that is, god .
thou knowest the command@@ ments, do not commit adulter@@ y, do not ki@@ ll, do not ste@@ al, do not bear false witness, honour thy father and thy mother .
and he said, all these have i kept from my you@@ th up .
now when jesus heard these things, he said unto him, yet la@@ ck@@ est thou one thing : se@@ ll all that thou ha@@ st, and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te unto the po@@ or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come, follow me .
and when he heard this, he was very sorrow@@ ful : for he was very rich .
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrow@@ ful, he said, how har@@ dly shall they that have ri@@ ches enter into the kingdom of god !
for it is easi@@ er for a ca@@ mel to go through a nee@@ dle 's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they that heard it said, who then can be saved ?
and he said, the things which are im@@ possible with men are possible with god .
then peter said, lo, we have left all, and followed thee .
and he said unto them, verily i say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of god 's sake ,
who shall not receive mani@@ fold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting .
then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, behold, we go up to jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accompli@@ shed .
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles, and shall be mo@@ c@@ ked, and spi@@ te@@ fully en@@ trea@@ ted, and spi@@ tted on :
and they shall scourge him, and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
and they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken .
and it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto jeri@@ cho@@ , a certain blind man sat by the way side beg@@ ging :
and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it me@@ ant .
and they told him, that jesus of nazareth pas@@ seth by .
and he cried, saying, jesus, thou son of david, have mercy on me .
and they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more, thou son of david, have mercy on me .
and jesus stoo@@ d, and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near, he asked him ,
saying, what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee ? and he said, lord, that i may receive my sight .
and jesus said unto him, receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
and immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glori@@ fying god : and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto god .
and jesus entered and passed through jeri@@ ch@@ o .
and, behold, there was a man named z@@ ac@@ cha@@ eus, which was the chief among the publican@@ s, and he was rich .
and he sought to see jesus who he was ; and could not for the pre@@ ss, because he was little of sta@@ ture .
and he ran be@@ fore, and c@@ li@@ mb@@ ed up into a sy@@ com@@ or@@ e tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
and when jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, z@@ ac@@ cha@@ eus, make ha@@ ste@@ , and come down ; for to day i must abide at thy house .
and he made ha@@ ste@@ , and came down, and received him jo@@ y@@ fully .
and when they saw it, they all murmu@@ red, saying, that he was gone to be gu@@ est with a man that is a sinner .
and z@@ ac@@ cha@@ e@@ us stoo@@ d, and said unto the lord : behold, lord, the ha@@ l@@ f of my goods i give to the poor ; and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accu@@ sa@@ tion, i re@@ stor@@ e him four@@ fold .
and jesus said unto him, this day is salvation come to this house, for@@ somuch as he also is a son of abraham .
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
and as they heard these things, he added and spake a parab@@ le, because he was nigh to jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear .
he said therefore, a certain no@@ ble@@ man went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return .
and he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten p@@ oun@@ ds, and said unto them, o@@ c@@ c@@ up@@ y till i come .
but his ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s hated him, and sent a mes@@ sa@@ ge after him, saying, we will not have this man to re@@ ign over us .
and it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the mone@@ y, that he might know how much every man had gained by tra@@ ding .
then came the first, saying, lord, thy p@@ ound hath gained ten p@@ oun@@ ds .
and he said unto him, well, thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very li@@ tt@@ le, have thou authority over ten cities .
and the second came, saying, lord, thy p@@ ound hath gained five p@@ oun@@ ds .
and he said likewise to him, be thou also over five cities .
and another came, saying, lord, behold, here is thy p@@ ound, which i have kept laid up in a na@@ p@@ k@@ in :
for i feared thee, because thou art an au@@ ster@@ e man : thou ta@@ kest up that thou la@@ ye@@ dst not down, and rea@@ p@@ est that thou didst not sow .
and he saith unto him, out of thine own mouth will i judge thee, thou wicked servant . thou kne@@ west that i was an au@@ ster@@ e man, taking up that i laid not down, and rea@@ p@@ ing that i did not sow :
wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the b@@ an@@ k, that at my coming i might have required mine own with u@@ su@@ ry ?
and he said unto them that stood by, take from him the p@@ ound, and give it to him that hath ten p@@ oun@@ ds .

for i say unto you, that unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
but those mine enemi@@ es, which would not that i should re@@ ign over them, bring hi@@ ther, and slay them before me .
and when he had thus spoken, he went be@@ fore, as@@ cen@@ ding up to jerusalem .
and it came to pass, when he was come nigh to beth@@ pha@@ ge and bethany, at the mount called the mount of oli@@ ves, he sent two of his disciples ,
saying, go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt ti@@ ed, where@@ on yet never man sat : loose him, and bring him hither .
and if any man ask you, why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him, because the lord hath need of him .
and they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them .
and as they were loo@@ sing the co@@ lt, the ow@@ ners thereof said unto them, why loose ye the colt ?
and they said, the lord hath need of him .
and they brought him to jesus : and they cast their garments upon the co@@ lt, and they set jesus thereon .
and as he went, they spread their clothes in the way .
and when he was come nigh@@ , even now at the des@@ c@@ ent of the mount of oli@@ ves, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
saying, blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord : peace in heaven, and glory in the highest .
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, master, rebu@@ ke thy disciples .
and he answered and said unto them, i tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately c@@ ry out .
and when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it ,
saying, if thou ha@@ dst know@@ n, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which be@@ long unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
for the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemi@@ es shall cast a tre@@ n@@ ch about thee, and com@@ pass thee r@@ ound, and keep thee in on every side ,
and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou kne@@ west not the time of thy visi@@ tation .
and he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold there@@ in, and them that bought ;
saying unto them, it is written, my house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
and could not find what they might do : for all the people were very a@@ tt@@ en@@ ti@@ ve to hear him .
and it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospe@@ l, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
and spake unto him, saying, tell us, by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
and he answered and said unto them, i will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
the baptism of john, was it from heaven, or of men ?
and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven ; he will say, why then believed ye him not ?
but and if we say, of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that john was a prophet .
and they answered, that they could not tell whence it was .
and jesus said unto them, neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; a certain man plan@@ ted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away e@@ mp@@ ty .
and again he sent another servant : and they beat him also, and en@@ trea@@ ted him sha@@ me@@ ful@@ ly, and sent him away e@@ mp@@ ty .
and again he sent a third : and they w@@ ounded him also, and cast him out .
then said the lord of the vineyard, what shall i do ? i will send my beloved son : it may be they will reve@@ re@@ nce him when they see him .
but when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, this is the he@@ ir : come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
he shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others . and when they heard it, they said, god forbid .
and he beheld them, and said, what is this then that is written, the stone which the build@@ ers reje@@ c@@ ted, the same is become the head of the cor@@ ner ?
whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fal@@ l, it will gr@@ ind him to po@@ w@@ der .
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
and they watched him, and sent forth spi@@ es, which should fe@@ ign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
and they asked him, saying, master, we know that thou sayest and teac@@ hest ri@@ ght@@ ly, neither ac@@ ce@@ p@@ test thou the per@@ son of an@@ y, but teac@@ hest the way of god truly :
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar, or no ?
but he perceived their cra@@ f@@ t@@ in@@ es@@ s, and said unto them, why tempt ye me ?
shew me a penny . whose image and super@@ scrip@@ tion hath it ? they answered and said, caesar 's .
and he said unto them, ren@@ der therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar 's, and unto god the things which be god 's .
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer@@ , and held their peace .
then came to him certain of the sadduce@@ es, which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
saying, master, moses wrote unto us, if any man 's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother .
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife, and died without children .
and the second took her to wife, and he died child@@ less .
and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children, and died .
last of all the woman died also .
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
and jesus answering said unto them, the children of this world mar@@ ry, and are given in marriage :
but they which shall be ac@@ counted worthy to ob@@ tain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither mar@@ ry, nor are given in marriage :
neither can they die any more : for they are e@@ qu@@ al unto the angels ; and are the children of god, being the children of the resurrection .
now that the dead are rai@@ sed, even moses shewed at the bu@@ s@@ h, when he calleth the lord the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob .
for he is not a god of the dead, but of the living : for all live unto him .
then certain of the scribes answering said, master, thou hast well said .
and after that they du@@ rst not ask him any question at all .
and he said unto them, how say they that christ is david 's son ?
and david himself saith in the book of p@@ sal@@ ms, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand ,
till i make thine enemi@@ es thy foo@@ tstool .
david therefore calleth him lord, how is he then his son ?
then in the au@@ di@@ ence of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long ro@@ bes, and love gree@@ t@@ ings in the marke@@ ts, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief roo@@ ms at fea@@ sts ;
which dev@@ our widows ' houses, and for a shew make long pray@@ ers : the same shall receive greater dam@@ nation .
and he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gif@@ ts into the treasu@@ ry .
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mi@@ tes .
and he said, of a truth i say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the off@@ er@@ ings of god : but she of her pen@@ u@@ ry hath cast in all the living that she had .
and as some spake of the temple, how it was ad@@ or@@ ned with goo@@ dly stones and gif@@ ts, he said ,
as for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be th@@ ro@@ wn down .
and they asked him, saying, master, but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
and he said, take heed that ye be not decei@@ ved : for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ ; and the time dra@@ weth near : go ye not therefore after them .
but when ye shall hear of war@@ s and com@@ mo@@ tions, be not ter@@ ri@@ fied : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
then said he unto them, nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom :
and great earth@@ qua@@ kes shall be in divers places, and fa@@ min@@ es, and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ces ; and fe@@ ar@@ ful si@@ gh@@ ts and great signs shall there be from heaven .
but before all the@@ se, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, deli@@ ver@@ ing you up to the synagogues, and into pris@@ ons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
and it shall turn to you for a testimony .
se@@ ttle it therefore in your hear@@ ts, not to medi@@ ta@@ te before what ye shall answer :
for i will give you a mouth and wis@@ dom, which all your ad@@ versa@@ ri@@ es shall not be able to ga@@ in@@ say nor resi@@ st .
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kin@@ s@@ fol@@ ks, and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
but there shall not an ha@@ ir of your head perish .
in your pa@@ ti@@ ence posses@@ s ye your souls .
and when ye shall see jerusalem com@@ passed with ar@@ mi@@ es, then know that the deso@@ lation thereof is nigh .
then let them which are in judaea flee to the moun@@ tains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the coun@@ tri@@ es enter there@@ into .
for these be the days of ven@@ ge@@ an@@ ce, that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
but woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give su@@ ck, in those days ! for there shall be great di@@ stre@@ ss in the land, and wra@@ th upon this people .
and they shall fall by the e@@ dge of the s@@ word, and shall be led away ca@@ pti@@ ve into all nations : and jerusalem shall be tro@@ d@@ den down of the gentiles, until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled .
and there shall be signs in the sun@@ , and in the mo@@ on, and in the star@@ s ; and upon the earth di@@ stre@@ ss of na@@ tions, with per@@ ple@@ x@@ ity ; the sea and the wa@@ ves ro@@ aring ;
men 's hearts fai@@ ling them for fe@@ ar, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the power@@ s of heaven shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a c@@ loud with power and great glory .
and when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your hea@@ ds ; for your re@@ dem@@ p@@ tion dra@@ weth nigh .
and he spake to them a parable ; behold the fig tree, and all the tre@@ es ;
when they now sho@@ ot forth, ye see and know of your own sel@@ ves that su@@ m@@ me@@ r is now nigh at hand .
so likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand .
verily i say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
and take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be over@@ charged with sur@@ fe@@ it@@ ing, and drun@@ k@@ en@@ ness, and ca@@ res of this life, and so that day come upon you un@@ a@@ wa@@ res .
for as a s@@ n@@ are shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
watch ye therefore, and pray al@@ ways, that ye may be ac@@ counted worthy to es@@ cap@@ e all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the son of man .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives .
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him .
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh@@ , which is called the passover .
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot, being of the number of the twelve .
and he went his way, and comm@@ un@@ ed with the chief priests and cap@@ tains, how he might betray him unto them .
and they were gla@@ d, and co@@ ven@@ an@@ ted to give him money .
and he promi@@ sed, and sought op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to betray him unto them in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of the multitude .
then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed .
and he sent peter and john, saying, go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat .
and they said unto him, where wilt thou that we prepare ?
and he said unto them, behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, be@@ aring a pi@@ t@@ c@@ her of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
and ye shall say unto the goo@@ d@@ man of the house, the master saith unto thee, where is the gu@@ es@@ t@@ cha@@ mb@@ er, where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and he shall shew you a l@@ ar@@ ge upper room fur@@ ni@@ shed : there make ready .
and they went, and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him .
and he said unto them, with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer :
for i say unto you, i will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god .
and he took the c@@ up, and gave thanks, and said, take this, and divi@@ de it among yourselves :
for i say unto you, i will not drink of the fruit of the vin@@ e, until the kingdom of god shall come .
and he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, this is my body which is given for you : this do in reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance of me .
likewise also the cup after sup@@ per, saying, this cup is the new t@@ esta@@ ment in my blood, which is shed for you .
but, behold, the hand of him that betra@@ yeth me is with me on the table .
and truly the son of man go@@ eth, as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
and they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing .
and there was also a stri@@ f@@ e among them, which of them should be ac@@ counted the greatest .
and he said unto them, the kings of the gentiles exercise lor@@ d@@ ship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called b@@ ene@@ fa@@ ctor@@ s .
but ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the you@@ n@@ ger ; and he that is chi@@ e@@ f, as he that doth serve .
for whether is grea@@ ter, he that si@@ tteth at meat, or he that ser@@ veth ? is not he that si@@ tteth at meat ? but i am among you as he that ser@@ veth .
ye are they which have continued with me in my temp@@ ta@@ tions .
and i appoin@@ t unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me ;
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thr@@ ones judg@@ ing the twelve tri@@ bes of israel .
and the lord said, simon, simon, behold, satan hath desired to have you, that he may si@@ ft you as wheat :
but i have prayed for thee, that thy faith fai@@ l not : and when thou art converted, streng@@ then thy brethren .
and he said unto him, lord, i am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death .
and he said, i tell thee, peter, the cock shall not c@@ row this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
and he said unto them, when i sent you without pur@@ se, and scri@@ p, and sho@@ es, la@@ cked ye any thing ? and they said, nothing .
then said he unto them, but now, he that hath a pur@@ se, let him take it, and likewise his scri@@ p : and he that hath no s@@ word, let him se@@ ll his gar@@ ment, and buy one .
for i say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accompli@@ shed in me, and he was re@@ ck@@ oned among the transgre@@ s@@ sor@@ s : for the things concerning me have an end .
and they said, lord, behold, here are two swords . and he said unto them, it is en@@ ough .
and he came out, and went, as he was won@@ t, to the mount of olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
and when he was at the place, he said unto them, pray that ye enter not into temptation .
and he was with@@ dra@@ wn from them about a stone 's ca@@ st, and kneeled down, and prayed ,
saying, father, if thou be wil@@ ling, re@@ move this cup from me : nevertheless not my will, but thin@@ e, be done .
and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, streng@@ the@@ ning him .
and being in an a@@ g@@ on@@ y he prayed more ear@@ nes@@ tly : and his swe@@ at was as it were great d@@ ro@@ ps of blood fal@@ ling down to the ground .
and when he rose up from pray@@ er, and was come to his disciples, he found them sle@@ ep@@ ing for sor@@ row ,
and said unto them, why sleep ye ? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation .
and while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto jesus to kis@@ s him .
but jesus said unto him, judas, betra@@ yest thou the son of man with a kis@@ s ?
when they which were about him saw what would follo@@ w, they said unto him, lord, shall we smite with the sword ?
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear .
and jesus answered and said, suffer ye thus far . and he touched his ear@@ , and healed him .
then jesus said unto the chief priests, and cap@@ tains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, be ye come out, as against a thie@@ f, with swords and sta@@ ves ?
when i was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour, and the power of darkness .
then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest 's house . and peter followed afar off .
and when they had kind@@ led a fire in the midst of the ha@@ ll, and were set down together, peter sat down among them .
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and ear@@ nes@@ tly looked upon him, and said, this man was also with him .
and he denied him, saying, woman, i know him not .
and after a little while another saw him, and said, thou art also of them . and peter said, man, i am not .
and about the space of one hour after another con@@ fi@@ den@@ tly af@@ fir@@ med, saying, of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a galilae@@ an .
and peter said, man, i know not what thou sayest . and immediate@@ ly, while he yet spake, the cock cre@@ w .
and the lord turned, and looked upon peter . and peter remembered the word of the lord, how he had said unto him, before the cock cro@@ w, thou shalt deny me thrice .
and peter went out, and wept bi@@ tter@@ ly .
and the men that held jesus mocked him, and smote him .
and when they had blin@@ d@@ fo@@ ld@@ ed him, they st@@ ru@@ ck him on the face, and asked him, saying, prophe@@ sy, who is it that smote thee ?
and many other things blasphe@@ mou@@ s@@ ly spake they against him .
and as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying ,
art thou the christ ? tell us . and he said unto them, if i tell you, ye will not believe :
and if i also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go .
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god .
then said they all, art thou then the son of god ? and he said unto them, ye say that i am .
and they said, what need we any further witness ? for we our@@ sel@@ ves have heard of his own mouth .
and the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto pilate .
and they began to accuse him, saying, we found this fellow perver@@ ting the nation, and for@@ bid@@ ding to give tribute to caesar, saying that he himself is christ a king .
and pilate asked him, saying, art thou the king of the jews ? and he answered him and said, thou sayest it .
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people, i find no fault in this man .
and they were the more fi@@ er@@ ce, saying, he stir@@ reth up the people, teaching throughout all jew@@ ry, beginning from galilee to this place .
when pilate heard of galilee, he asked whether the man were a galilae@@ an .
and as soon as he knew that he be@@ lon@@ ged unto herod 's ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ ction, he sent him to herod, who himself also was at jerusalem at that time .
and when herod saw jesus, he was exceeding glad : for he was desi@@ r@@ ous to see him of a long seas@@ on, because he had heard many things of him ; and he ho@@ ped to have seen some miracle done by him .
then he questi@@ oned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
and the chief priests and scribes stood and ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly accused him .
and herod with his men of wa@@ r set him at n@@ ou@@ ght, and mocked him, and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous ro@@ be, and sent him again to pilate .
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together : for before they were at en@@ mi@@ ty between themselves .
and pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
said unto them, ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perver@@ teth the people : and, behold, i, having exa@@ mined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
no, nor yet herod : for i sent you to him ; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
i will therefore cha@@ sti@@ se him, and release him .

and they cried out all at on@@ ce, saying, away with this man, and release unto us barabbas :

pilate therefore, willing to release jesus, spake again to them .
but they cried, saying, crucify him, crucify him .
and he said unto them the third time, wh@@ y, what evil hath he done ? i have found no cause of death in him : i will therefore cha@@ sti@@ se him, and let him go .
and they were in@@ stan@@ t with loud voi@@ ces, re@@ qui@@ ring that he might be crucified . and the voi@@ ces of them and of the chief priests pre@@ vai@@ led .
and pilate gave sen@@ t@@ ence that it should be as they required .
and he re@@ leased unto them him that for se@@ dition and mur@@ der was cast into prison, whom they had desired ; but he delivered jesus to their will .
and as they led him away, they laid hold upon one simon, a cy@@ re@@ ni@@ an, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after jesus .
and there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also be@@ wai@@ led and la@@ men@@ ted him .
but jesus tur@@ ning unto them said, daugh@@ ters of jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children .
for, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, blessed are the bar@@ re@@ n, and the wo@@ mbs that never ba@@ re, and the pa@@ ps which never gave su@@ ck .
then shall they begin to say to the moun@@ tains, fall on us ; and to the hi@@ l@@ ls, co@@ ver us .
for if they do these things in a gre@@ en tree, what shall be done in the d@@ ry ?
and there were also two o@@ ther, ma@@ le@@ fa@@ ctor@@ s, led with him to be put to death .
and when they were come to the place, which is called cal@@ v@@ ar@@ y, there they crucified him, and the ma@@ le@@ fa@@ ctor@@ s, one on the right hand, and the other on the left .
then said jesus, father, forgive them ; for they know not what they do . and they parted his rai@@ ment, and cast lots .
and the people stood beholding . and the rulers also with them der@@ i@@ ded him, saying, he saved others ; let him save himself, if he be christ, the chosen of god .
and the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and off@@ ering him vine@@ ga@@ r ,
and saying, if thou be the king of the jews, save thyself .
and a super@@ scrip@@ tion also was written over him in le@@ tters of gree@@ k, and la@@ t@@ in, and hebre@@ w, this is the king of the jews .
and one of the ma@@ le@@ fa@@ ctor@@ s which were hanged rai@@ led on him, saying, if thou be christ, save thyself and us .
but the other answering rebuked him, saying, dost not thou fear god, seeing thou art in the same condem@@ nation ?
and we indeed ju@@ st@@ ly ; for we receive the du@@ e reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing a@@ mi@@ ss .
and he said unto jesus, lord, remember me when thou com@@ est into thy kingdom .
and jesus said unto him, verily i say unto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in para@@ di@@ se .
and it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
and the sun was dark@@ en@@ ed, and the ve@@ il of the temple was rent in the midst .
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, father, into thy hands i comm@@ end my spirit : and having said th@@ us, he gave up the ghost .
now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified god, saying, cer@@ tain@@ ly this was a righteous man .
and all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their brea@@ st@@ s, and returned .
and all his ac@@ qua@@ int@@ an@@ ce, and the women that followed him from galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things .
and, behold, there was a man named joseph, a coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or ; and he was a good man, and a just :
he was of ari@@ ma@@ tha@@ e@@ a, a city of the jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of god .
this man went unto pilate, and beg@@ ged the body of jesus .
and he took it down, and wrapped it in lin@@ en, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in st@@ one, wherein never man before was laid .
and that day was the pre@@ para@@ tion, and the sabbath drew on .
and the women also, which came with him from galilee, followed af@@ ter, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid .
and they returned, and prepared spi@@ ces and oint@@ ments ; and re@@ sted the sabbath day according to the commandment .
now upon the first day of the week, very early in the mor@@ ning, they came unto the sepulchre, bring@@ ing the spi@@ ces which they had prepa@@ red, and certain others with them .
and they found the stone ro@@ lled away from the sepulchre .
and they entered in, and found not the body of the lord jesus .
and it came to pass, as they were much per@@ ple@@ xed there@@ about, behold, two men stood by them in shi@@ ning garments :
and as they were afrai@@ d, and bo@@ wed down their fa@@ ces to the earth, they said unto them, why seek ye the living among the dead ?
he is not here, but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
saying, the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sin@@ ful men, and be cruci@@ fied, and the third day rise again .
and they remembered his words ,
and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the ele@@ ven, and to all the rest .
it was mary magdalene and jo@@ an@@ na, and mary the mother of james, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles .
and their words seemed to them as i@@ dle tal@@ es, and they believed them not .
then arose peter, and ran unto the sepulchre ; and sto@@ op@@ ing down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wond@@ ering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called e@@ m@@ ma@@ us, which was from jerusalem about thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e fur@@ lon@@ gs .
and they talked together of all these things which had ha@@ pp@@ ened .
and it came to pass, that, while they comm@@ un@@ ed together and reas@@ on@@ ed, jesus himself drew near, and went with them .
but their eyes were ho@@ l@@ den that they should not know him .
and he said unto them, what manner of comm@@ un@@ i@@ ca@@ tions are these that ye have one to another, as ye wal@@ k, and are sa@@ d ?
and the one of them, whose name was cle@@ o@@ pa@@ s, answering said unto him, art thou only a str@@ anger in jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
and he said unto them, what things ? and they said unto him, concerning jesus of nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in de@@ ed and word before god and all the people :
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him .
but we tru@@ sted that it had been he which should have re@@ dee@@ med israel : and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done .
yea, and certain women also of our company made us astoni@@ shed, which were early at the sepulchre ;
and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of ange@@ ls, which said that he was a@@ live .
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
then he said unto them, o foo@@ ls, and s@@ low of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
ought not christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory ?
and beginning at moses and all the prophets, he ex@@ p@@ ounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
and they drew nigh unto the villa@@ ge, whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
but they con@@ strained him, saying, abide with us : for it is toward even@@ ing, and the day is far sp@@ ent . and he went in to tarry with them .
and it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and bra@@ ke, and gave to them .
and their eyes were opened, and they knew him ; and he van@@ ished out of their sight .
and they said one to another, did not our heart bur@@ n within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
and they rose up the same hour, and returned to jerusalem, and found the ele@@ ven gathered together, and them that were with them ,
saying, the lord is risen inde@@ ed, and hath appeared to simon .
and they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in brea@@ king of bread .
and as they thus spake, jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, peace be unto you .
but they were ter@@ ri@@ fied and af@@ fri@@ gh@@ ted, and suppo@@ sed that they had seen a spirit .
and he said unto them, why are ye troubled ? and why do though@@ ts arise in your hearts ?
behold my hands and my feet, that it is i myself : han@@ dle me, and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bon@@ es, as ye see me have .
and when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet .
and while they yet believed not for jo@@ y, and won@@ de@@ red, he said unto them, have ye here any meat ?
and they gave him a piece of a bro@@ i@@ led fi@@ s@@ h, and of an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
and he took it, and did eat before them .
and he said unto them, these are the words which i spake unto you, while i was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of moses, and in the prophets, and in the p@@ sal@@ ms, concerning me .
then opened he their under@@ standing, that they might understand the scriptures ,
and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it beho@@ ved christ to suf@@ f@@ er, and to rise from the dead the third day :
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all na@@ tions, beginning at jerusalem .
and ye are witnesses of these things .
and, behold, i send the promise of my father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem, until ye be en@@ du@@ ed with power from on high .
and he led them out as far as to bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them .
and it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven .
and they worshipped him, and returned to jerusalem with great joy :
and were continu@@ al@@ ly in the temple, praising and bles@@ sing god . a@@ men
the for@@ me@@ r trea@@ ti@@ se have i ma@@ de, o the@@ op@@ hi@@ l@@ us, of all that jesus began both to do and teach ,
until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he shewed himself a@@ live after his pas@@ sion by many in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble pro@@ of@@ s, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things per@@ tain@@ ing to the kingdom of god :
and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me .
for john truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence .
when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, lord, wilt thou at this time re@@ stor@@ e again the kingdom to israel ?
and he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seas@@ ons, which the father hath put in his own power .
but ye shall receive power, after that the holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem, and in all judaea, and in samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
and when he had spoken these things, while they be@@ he@@ ld, he was taken up ; and a c@@ loud received him out of their sight .
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l ;
which also said, ye men of galilee, why stand ye ga@@ z@@ ing up into heaven ? this same jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called oli@@ ve@@ t, which is from jerusalem a sabbath day 's journe@@ y .
and when they were come in, they went up into an upper roo@@ m, where abode both peter, and james, and john, and and@@ re@@ w, philip, and thomas, bar@@ tho@@ lo@@ me@@ w, and mat@@ the@@ w, james the son of al@@ pha@@ eus, and simon ze@@ lo@@ tes, and judas the brother of james .
these all continued with one accord in prayer and sup@@ pli@@ ca@@ tion, with the women, and mary the mother of jesus, and with his brethren .
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, 
men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas, which was gu@@ ide to them that took jesus .
for he was nu@@ mbered with us, and had ob@@ ta@@ ined part of this mini@@ st@@ ry .
now this man pur@@ cha@@ sed a field with the reward of iniquity ; and fal@@ ling hea@@ d@@ lon@@ g, he bur@@ st as@@ under in the midst, and all his bo@@ we@@ ls gu@@ shed out .
and it was known unto all the dwel@@ l@@ ers at jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their pro@@ per tongu@@ e, a@@ ce@@ l@@ da@@ ma@@ , that is to say, the field of blood .
for it is written in the book of p@@ sal@@ ms, let his ha@@ bi@@ tation be deso@@ la@@ te, and let no man dwell therein : and his b@@ is@@ ho@@ pri@@ ck let another take .
wherefore of these men which have comp@@ ani@@ ed with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us ,
beginning from the baptism of john, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and they appointed t@@ wo@@ , joseph called bar@@ sa@@ bas, who was surnamed ju@@ st@@ us, and mat@@ thi@@ as .
and they prayed, and said, thou, lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
that he may take part of this mini@@ st@@ ry and apost@@ les@@ hi@@ p, from which judas by transgre@@ s@@ sion fe@@ ll, that he might go to his own place .
and they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon mat@@ thi@@ as ; and he was nu@@ mbered with the ele@@ ven apostles .
and when the day of p@@ ente@@ co@@ st was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place .
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a ru@@ shi@@ ng mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared unto them clo@@ ven tongu@@ es like as of fire, and it sat upon ea@@ ch of them .
and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongu@@ es, as the spirit gave them utter@@ ance .
and there were dwel@@ ling at jerusalem jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven .
now when this was no@@ ised abro@@ a@@ d, the multitude came together, and were con@@ foun@@ ded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and they were all amaz@@ ed and marvelled, saying one to another, behold, are not all these which speak galilae@@ ans ?
and how hear we every man in our own tongu@@ e, wherein we were born ?
par@@ thi@@ ans, and me@@ des, and e@@ la@@ mi@@ tes, and the dwel@@ l@@ ers in mes@@ o@@ po@@ ta@@ mi@@ a, and in judaea, and cap@@ pa@@ do@@ ci@@ a, in pon@@ tus, and asia ,
ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a, and pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, in egypt, and in the par@@ ts of li@@ b@@ y@@ a about cy@@ ren@@ e, and strangers of ro@@ me, jews and pro@@ sel@@ y@@ tes ,
cre@@ tes and ar@@ abi@@ ans, we do hear them speak in our tongu@@ es the wond@@ er@@ ful works of god .
and they were all amazed, and were in doub@@ t, saying one to another, what me@@ an@@ eth this ?
others mo@@ c@@ king said, these men are full of new wine .
but peter, standing up with the ele@@ ven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, ye men of judaea, and all ye that dwell at jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words :
for these are not drun@@ ken, as ye suppo@@ se, seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet jo@@ el ;
and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith god, i will p@@ our out of my spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daugh@@ ters shall prophe@@ sy, and your young men shall see visi@@ ons, and your old men shall drea@@ m drea@@ ms :
and on my servants and on my han@@ d@@ mai@@ den@@ s i will p@@ our out in those days of my spirit ; and they shall prophe@@ sy :
and i will shew wonders in heaven abo@@ ve, and signs in the earth b@@ ene@@ a@@ th ; blood, and fire, and v@@ ap@@ our of s@@ mo@@ ke :
the sun shall be turned into dark@@ ness, and the mo@@ on into blood, before the great and no@@ table day of the lord come :
and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
ye men of israel, hear these words ; jesus of nazareth, a man ap@@ pro@@ ved of god among you by miracles and wonders and sig@@ ns, which god did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know :
him, being delivered by the deter@@ min@@ a@@ te counsel and fore@@ knowledge of god, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
whom god hath raised up, having loosed the pa@@ ins of death : because it was not possible that he should be ho@@ l@@ den of it .
for david speaketh concerning him, i fore@@ saw the lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that i should not be moved :
therefore did my heart rejoi@@ ce, and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
because thou wilt not leave my soul in he@@ ll, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corrup@@ tion .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy coun@@ ten@@ ance .
men and brethren, let me fre@@ e@@ ly speak unto you of the pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch david, that he is both dead and bu@@ ri@@ ed, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
therefore being a prophet, and knowing that god had s@@ wor@@ n with an oa@@ th to him, that of the fruit of his lo@@ in@@ s, according to the flesh, he would raise up christ to sit on his throne ;
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ, that his soul was not left in he@@ ll, neither his flesh did see corrup@@ tion .
this jesus hath god raised up, whereof we all are witnesses .
therefore being by the right hand of god exal@@ ted, and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear .
for david is not as@@ cen@@ ded into the heavens : but he saith himself, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand ,
until i make thy fo@@ es thy foo@@ tstool .
therefore let all the house of israel know as@@ sure@@ d@@ ly, that god hath made the same jesus, whom ye have cruci@@ fied, both lord and christ .
now when they heard this, they were pri@@ cked in their heart, and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do ?
then peter said unto them, repen@@ t, and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost .
for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the lord our god shall call .
and with many other words did he testify and exhor@@ t, saying, save yourselves from this un@@ toward generation .
then they that gla@@ dly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellow@@ ship, and in brea@@ king of bread, and in pray@@ ers .
and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
and all that believed were together, and had all things common ;
and sold their posses@@ sions and goo@@ ds, and parted them to all men, as every man had need .
and they, continu@@ ing daily with one accord in the temple, and brea@@ king bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gla@@ dness and s@@ ing@@ len@@ ess of heart ,
praising god, and having fav@@ our with all the people . and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of pray@@ er, being the ninth hour .
and a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was car@@ ri@@ ed, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms .
and peter, fast@@ en@@ ing his eyes upon him with john, said, look on us .
and he gave heed unto them, expe@@ c@@ ting to receive something of them .
then peter said, silver and go@@ ld have i none ; but such as i have give i thee : in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk .
and he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and an@@ k@@ le b@@ ones received streng@@ th .
and he lea@@ p@@ ing up stoo@@ d, and wal@@ ked, and entered with them into the temple, wal@@ king, and lea@@ p@@ ing, and praising god .
and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful gate of the temple : and they were filled with won@@ der and ama@@ ze@@ ment at that which had ha@@ pp@@ ened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john, all the people ran together unto them in the por@@ ch that is called solomon 's, greatly wond@@ ering .
and when peter saw it, he answered unto the people, ye men of israel, why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so ear@@ nes@@ tly on us, as though by our own power or ho@@ lin@@ ess we had made this man to walk ?
the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jaco@@ b, the god of our fathers, hath glorified his son jesus ; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of pilate, when he was determined to let him go .
but ye denied the holy one and the ju@@ st, and desired a murde@@ re@@ r to be gran@@ ted unto you ;
and killed the prince of life, whom god hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man str@@ on@@ g, whom ye see and know : yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect s@@ oun@@ dness in the presence of you all .
and now, brethren, i wo@@ t that through i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ye did it, as did also your rulers .
but those things, which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that christ should suf@@ f@@ er, he hath so fulfilled .
repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be b@@ lo@@ tted out, when the times of re@@ fre@@ shi@@ ng shall come from the presence of the lord .
and he shall send jesus christ, which before was preached unto you :
whom the heaven must receive until the times of re@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion of all things, which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for moses truly said unto the fathers, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
and it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destro@@ yed from among the people .
yea, and all the prophets from sa@@ mu@@ el and those that follow af@@ ter, as many as have spoken, have likewise fore@@ told of these days .
ye are the children of the prophets, and of the co@@ ven@@ ant which god made with our fathers, saying unto abraham, and in thy seed shall all the kind@@ re@@ ds of the earth be blessed .
unto you first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him to bles@@ s you, in tur@@ ning away every one of you from his iniqui@@ ties .
and as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadduce@@ es, came upon them ,
being grie@@ ved that they taught the people, and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead .
and they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now even@@ ti@@ de .
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
and it came to pass on the morrow, that their rul@@ ers, and elders, and scribes ,
and an@@ n@@ as the high priest, and caiapha@@ s, and john, and alex@@ and@@ er, and as many as were of the kind@@ red of the high priest, were gathered together at jerusalem .
and when they had set them in the midst, they aske@@ d, by what power, or by what name, have ye done this ?
then peter, filled with the holy ghost, said unto them, ye rulers of the people, and elders of israel ,
if we this day be exa@@ mined of the good de@@ ed done to the im@@ po@@ t@@ ent man, by what means he is made whole ;
be it known unto you all, and to all the people of israel, that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth, whom ye cruci@@ fied, whom god raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
this is the stone which was set at n@@ ought of you build@@ ers, which is become the head of the cor@@ ner .
neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men, where@@ by we must be saved .
now when they saw the bold@@ ness of peter and john, and perceived that they were un@@ lear@@ ned and i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant men, they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with jesus .
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they con@@ fer@@ red among themselves ,
saying, what shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a no@@ table miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
but that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly th@@ rea@@ ten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
but peter and john answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god, judge ye .
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
so when they had further th@@ rea@@ t@@ ened them, they let them go, fin@@ ding nothing how they might p@@ un@@ ish them, because of the people : for all men glorified god for that which was done .
for the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
and being let go, they went to their own comp@@ an@@ y, and re@@ por@@ ted all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
and when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to god with one accor@@ d, and said, lord, thou art god, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is :
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said, why did the hea@@ then ra@@ ge, and the people i@@ mag@@ ine va@@ in things ?
the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the lord, and against his christ .
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus, whom thou hast anoin@@ ted, both herod, and pon@@ ti@@ us pilate, with the gentiles, and the people of israel, were gathered together ,
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
and now, lord, behold their th@@ rea@@ ten@@ ings : and gran@@ t unto thy servants, that with all bold@@ ness they may speak thy word ,
by stret@@ ching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus .
and when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and they spake the word of god with bold@@ ness .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
neither was there any among them that la@@ cked : for as many as were posses@@ sor@@ s of lan@@ ds or hou@@ ses sold them, and brought the pri@@ ces of the things that were sold ,
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion was made unto every man according as he had need .
and jo@@ ses, who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas, a le@@ vi@@ te, and of the country of cyp@@ r@@ us ,
having land, sold it, and brought the mone@@ y, and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
but a certain man named anani@@ as, with sa@@ pp@@ hi@@ r@@ a his wife, sold a posses@@ sion ,
and kept back part of the pri@@ ce, his wife also being priv@@ y to it, and brought a certain par@@ t, and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
but peter said, anani@@ as, why hath satan filled thine heart to li@@ e to the holy ghost, and to keep back part of the pri@@ ce of the land ?
whi@@ les it rema@@ in@@ ed, was it not thine own ? and after it was so@@ ld, was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou con@@ cei@@ ved this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not li@@ ed unto men, but unto god .
and ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
and the young men arose, w@@ ound him up, and carried him out, and bu@@ ried him .
and it was about the space of three hou@@ rs af@@ ter, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in .
and peter answered unto her, tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ? and she said, yea, for so much .
then peter said unto her, how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord ? behold, the feet of them which have bu@@ ried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out .
then fell she down straightway at his feet, and y@@ i@@ eld@@ ed up the ghost : and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, car@@ rying her forth, bu@@ ried her by her husband .
and great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things .
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in solomon 's por@@ ch .
and of the rest du@@ rst no man jo@@ in himself to them : but the people mag@@ ni@@ fied them .
and belie@@ vers were the more added to the lord, multitudes both of men and women . )
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the stree@@ ts, and laid them on be@@ ds and c@@ ou@@ che@@ s, that at the least the shadow of peter pas@@ sing by might over@@ shadow some of them .
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem, bring@@ ing sick fol@@ ks, and them which were ve@@ xed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, and were filled with indi@@ g@@ nation ,
and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison .
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison do@@ or@@ s, and brought them forth, and said ,
go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
and when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the mor@@ ning, and taught . but the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the sen@@ a@@ te of the children of israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought .
but when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told ,
saying, the prison truly found we shut with all sa@@ fe@@ ty, and the kee@@ pers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened, we found no man within .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doub@@ ted of them whereunto this would g@@ row .
then came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people .
then went the captain with the officer@@ s, and brought them without viol@@ ence : for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned .
and when they had brought them, they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
saying, did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and, behold, ye have filled jerusalem with your doctr@@ in@@ e, and int@@ end to bring this man 's blood upon us .
then peter and the other apostles answered and said, we ought to obey god rather than men .
the god of our fathers raised up jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a sa@@ vi@@ our, for to give repentance to israel, and forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the holy ghost, whom god hath given to them that obey him .
when they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them .
then stood there up one in the council, a pharise@@ e, named ga@@ ma@@ lie@@ l, a doc@@ t@@ or of the law, had in re@@ pu@@ tation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;
and said unto them, ye men of israel, take heed to yourselves what ye int@@ end to do as touching these men .
for before these days rose up the@@ u@@ da@@ s, bo@@ ast@@ ing himself to be some@@ body ; to whom a number of men, about four hund@@ red, jo@@ ined themselves : who was slain ; and all, as many as obe@@ yed him, were scatte@@ red, and brought to n@@ ought .
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the ta@@ x@@ ing, and drew away much people after him : he also per@@ ished ; and all, even as many as obe@@ yed him, were disp@@ er@@ sed .
and now i say unto you, re@@ fra@@ in from these men, and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to n@@ ought :
but if it be of god, ye cannot over@@ th@@ row it ; lest ha@@ ply ye be found even to fi@@ ght against god .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles, and be@@ ate@@ n them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus, and let them go .
and they departed from the presence of the council, rejoi@@ c@@ ing that they were counted worthy to suffer sha@@ me for his name .
and daily in the temple, and in every house, they ce@@ ased not to teach and preach jesus christ .
and in those days, when the number of the disciples was multi@@ p@@ lie@@ d, there arose a mur@@ mur@@ ing of the gre@@ ci@@ ans against the hebre@@ w@@ s, because their widows were ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted in the daily mini@@ stra@@ tion .
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of god, and serve ta@@ b@@ les .
where@@ fore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of hon@@ est re@@ por@@ t, full of the holy ghost and wis@@ dom, whom we may appoin@@ t over this bu@@ sin@@ ess .
but we will give our@@ sel@@ ves continu@@ al@@ ly to pray@@ er, and to the mini@@ st@@ ry of the word .
and the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they cho@@ se stephe@@ n, a man full of faith and of the holy ghost, and philip, and pro@@ ch@@ or@@ us, and ni@@ can@@ or, and ti@@ mon, and par@@ men@@ as, and nico@@ l@@ as a pro@@ sel@@ y@@ te of antioch :
whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them .
and the word of god incre@@ ased ; and the number of the disciples multi@@ pli@@ ed in jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obe@@ di@@ ent to the faith .
and stephe@@ n, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people .
then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the liber@@ t@@ in@@ es, and cy@@ re@@ ni@@ ans, and alex@@ and@@ ri@@ ans, and of them of cilici@@ a and of asi@@ a, dispu@@ ting with stephe@@ n .
and they were not able to resi@@ st the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
then they su@@ bor@@ ned men, which said, we have heard him speak blasphe@@ m@@ ous words against moses, and against god .
and they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council ,
and set up false witnes@@ ses, which said, this man cea@@ seth not to speak blasphe@@ m@@ ous words against this holy place, and the law :
for we have heard him say, that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall chan@@ ge the custo@@ ms which moses delivered us .
and all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
then said the high priest, are these things so ?
and he said, men, brethren, and fathers, hearken ; the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham, when he was in mes@@ o@@ po@@ ta@@ mi@@ a, before he dwelt in char@@ ran ,
and said unto him, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kind@@ red, and come into the land which i shall shew thee .
then came he out of the land of the cha@@ l@@ da@@ e@@ ans, and dwelt in char@@ ran : and from thence, when his father was dead, he re@@ moved him into this land, wherein ye now dwell .
and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promi@@ sed that he would give it to him for a posses@@ sion, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child .
and god spake on this wise, that his seed should so@@ jour@@ n in a stran@@ ge land ; and that they should bring them into bon@@ da@@ ge, and en@@ tre@@ at them evil four hundred years .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bon@@ da@@ ge will i judge, said god : and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place .
and he gave him the co@@ ven@@ ant of circumci@@ sion : and so abraham begat isaac, and circumci@@ sed him the e@@ igh@@ th day ; and isa@@ a@@ c begat jacob ; and jacob begat the twelve pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch@@ s .
and the pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch@@ s, moved with en@@ v@@ y, sold joseph into egypt : but god was with him ,
and delivered him out of all his affli@@ c@@ tions, and gave him fav@@ our and wisdom in the sight of pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h king of egypt ; and he made him governor over egypt and all his house .
now there came a de@@ ar@@ th over all the land of egypt and chan@@ a@@ an, and great affli@@ ction : and our fathers found no su@@ st@@ en@@ ance .
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt, he sent out our fathers first .
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren ; and joseph 's kind@@ red was made known unto pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h .
then sent joseph, and called his father jacob to him, and all his kind@@ red, thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and fif@@ teen souls .
so jacob went down into egypt, and di@@ ed, he, and our fathers ,
and were carried over into sy@@ che@@ m, and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a su@@ m of money of the sons of e@@ m@@ m@@ or the father of sy@@ che@@ m .
but when the time of the promise drew nigh@@ , which god had s@@ wor@@ n to abraham, the people gre@@ w and multi@@ pli@@ ed in egypt ,
till another king arose, which knew not joseph .
the same de@@ al@@ t sub@@ ti@@ l@@ ly with our kind@@ red, and evil en@@ trea@@ ted our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live .
in which time moses was bor@@ n, and was exceeding fai@@ r, and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed up in his father 's house three month@@ s :
and when he was cast out, pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h 's daughter took him up, and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed him for her own son .
and moses was lear@@ ned in all the wisdom of the egy@@ pti@@ ans, and was mighty in words and in deeds .
and when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to vi@@ sit his brethren the children of israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wr@@ on@@ g, he de@@ f@@ en@@ ded him, and a@@ ven@@ ged him that was op@@ pre@@ s@@ sed, and smote the egy@@ pti@@ an :
for he suppo@@ sed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they st@@ ro@@ ve, and would have set them at one again, saying, sirs, ye are brethren ; why do ye wr@@ ong one to another ?
but he that did his neighbour wr@@ ong thrust him away, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
wilt thou kill me, as thou di@@ d@@ dest the egy@@ pti@@ an y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ?
then fled moses at this saying, and was a str@@ anger in the land of ma@@ di@@ an, where he begat two sons .
and when forty years were ex@@ pi@@ red, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sin@@ a an angel of the lord in a f@@ lame of fire in a bu@@ sh .
when moses saw it, he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the lord came unto him ,
saying, i am the god of thy fathers, the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob . then moses tremb@@ led, and du@@ rst not behold .
then said the lord to him, put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou stand@@ est is holy ground .
i have se@@ en, i have seen the affli@@ ction of my people which is in egypt, and i have heard their g@@ ro@@ an@@ ing, and am come down to deliver them . and now come, i will send thee into egypt .
this moses whom they re@@ fu@@ sed, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deli@@ ve@@ re@@ r by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bu@@ sh .
he brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that moses, which said unto the children of israel, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
this is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sin@@ a, and with our fathers : who received the li@@ ve@@ ly or@@ ac@@ les to give unto us :
to whom our fathers would not obe@@ y, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into egypt ,
saying unto a@@ ar@@ on, make us go@@ ds to go before us : for as for this moses, which brought us out of the land of egypt, we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
and they made a cal@@ f in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the i@@ do@@ l, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
then god turned, and gave them up to worship the ho@@ st of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets, o ye house of israel, have ye offered to me slain be@@ asts and sacrifi@@ ces by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
yea, ye took up the tabernac@@ le of mo@@ lo@@ ch, and the st@@ ar of your god re@@ mp@@ han@@ , fi@@ gu@@ res which ye made to worship them : and i will carry you away beyond b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on .
our fathers had the tabernac@@ le of witness in the wilderness, as he had appoin@@ ted, speaking unto moses, that he should make it according to the f@@ as@@ hi@@ on that he had seen .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the posses@@ sion of the gentiles, whom god dra@@ ve out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of david ;
who found fav@@ our before god, and desired to find a tabernac@@ le for the god of jacob .
but solomon built him an house .
howbeit the most high dwel@@ leth not in tem@@ ple@@ s made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
heaven is my thr@@ one, and earth is my foo@@ tstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
hath not my hand made all these things ?
ye sti@@ f@@ f@@ ne@@ cked and un@@ circumci@@ sed in heart and ears, ye do always resi@@ st the holy ghost : as your fathers did, so do ye .
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one ; of whom ye have been now the betra@@ y@@ ers and murde@@ rers :
who have received the law by the di@@ spo@@ si@@ tion of ange@@ ls, and have not kept it .
when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnas@@ he@@ d on him with their teeth .
but he, being full of the holy ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of god, and jesus standing on the right hand of god ,
and said, behold, i see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
then they cried out with a loud voice, and st@@ op@@ ped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord ,
and cast him out of the city, and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet, whose name was saul .
and they stoned stephe@@ n, calling upon god, and saying, lord jesus, receive my spirit .
and he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, lord, lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this, he fell asle@@ ep .
and saul was con@@ sen@@ ting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecu@@ tion against the church which was at jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the re@@ gi@@ ons of judaea and samaria, except the apostles .
and devout men carried stephe@@ n to his bu@@ ri@@ al, and made great la@@ men@@ tation over him .
as for saul, he made ha@@ vo@@ ck of the church, entering into every house, and ha@@ ling men and women committed them to prison .
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
then philip went down to the city of samaria, and preached christ unto them .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
for unclean spiri@@ ts, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with pal@@ si@@ es, and that were la@@ me, were healed .
and there was great joy in that city .
but there was a certain man, called simon, which be@@ fore@@ time in the same city used sor@@ cer@@ y, and be@@ wit@@ ched the people of samaria, gi@@ ving out that himself was some great one :
to whom they all gave he@@ ed, from the least to the grea@@ t@@ est, saying, this man is the great power of god .
and to him they had regar@@ d, because that of long time he had be@@ wit@@ ched them with sor@@ cer@@ i@@ es .
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god, and the name of jesus christ, they were baptized, both men and women .
then simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized, he continued with philip, and won@@ de@@ red, beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god, they sent unto them peter and john :
who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy ghost :

then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy ghost .
and when simon saw that through la@@ ying on of the apostles ' hands the holy ghost was gi@@ ven, he offered them money ,
saying, give me also this power, that on whomsoever i lay hands, he may receive the holy ghost .
but peter said unto him, thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be pur@@ cha@@ sed with money .
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of god .
repent therefore of this thy wi@@ c@@ ke@@ d@@ ness, and pray god, if per@@ ha@@ ps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
for i perceive that thou art in the ga@@ ll of bi@@ tter@@ ness, and in the bon@@ d of iniquity .
then answered simon, and said, pray ye to the lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they, when they had testi@@ fied and preached the word of the lord, returned to jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villa@@ ges of the samarit@@ ans .
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip, saying, arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto ga@@ z@@ a, which is desert .
and he arose and went : and, behold, a man of e@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a, an eunu@@ ch of great authority under can@@ da@@ ce qu@@ e@@ en of the e@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ ans, who had the charge of all her treasu@@ re, and had come to jerusalem for to worship ,
was retur@@ ning, and sitting in his cha@@ ri@@ ot read esaias the prophet .
then the spirit said unto philip, go near, and jo@@ in thyself to this cha@@ ri@@ ot .
and philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet esai@@ as, and said, under@@ stand@@ est thou what thou rea@@ dest ?
and he said, how can i, except some man should gu@@ ide me ? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him .
the place of the scripture which he read was this, he was led as a sheep to the sla@@ ugh@@ ter ; and like a la@@ mb dumb before his s@@ hea@@ re@@ r, so opened he not his mouth :
in his hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
and the eunu@@ ch answered philip, and said, i pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself, or of some other man ?
then philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scriptu@@ re, and preached unto him jesus .
and as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water : and the eunu@@ ch said, see, here is water ; what doth hin@@ der me to be baptized ?
and philip said, if thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest . and he answered and said, i believe that jesus christ is the son of god .
and he commanded the cha@@ ri@@ ot to stand still : and they went down both into the water, both philip and the eunu@@ ch ; and he baptized him .
and when they were come up out of the water, the spirit of the lord caught away philip, that the eunu@@ ch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoi@@ c@@ ing .
but philip was found at a@@ z@@ o@@ tus : and pas@@ sing through he preached in all the ci@@ ties, till he came to caesarea .
and saul, yet brea@@ thing out th@@ rea@@ ten@@ ings and sla@@ ugh@@ ter against the disciples of the lord, went unto the high priest ,
and desired of him le@@ tters to damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto jerusalem .
and as he journe@@ ye@@ d, he came near damascus : and suddenly there shi@@ ned round about him a light from heaven :
and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ?
and he said, who art thou, lord ? and the lord said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to ki@@ ck against the pri@@ c@@ ks .
and he tremb@@ ling and astonished said, lord, what wilt thou have me to do ? and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and the men which journe@@ yed with him stood spee@@ ch@@ les@@ s, hearing a voice, but seeing no man .
and saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man : but they led him by the hand, and brought him into damascus .
and he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink .
and there was a certain disciple at damasc@@ us, named ananias ; and to him said the lord in a visi@@ on, ananias . and he said, behold, i am here, lord .
and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the stre@@ et which is called strai@@ ght, and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul, of tar@@ sus : for, behold, he praye@@ th ,
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in, and pu@@ tting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight .
then ananias answered, lord, i have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy sa@@ ints at jerusalem :
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
but the lord said unto him, go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the gentiles, and king@@ s, and the children of israel :
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name 's sake .
and ananias went his way, and entered into the house ; and pu@@ tting his hands on him said, brother saul, the lord, even jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou ca@@ m@@ est, hath sent me, that thou mi@@ ght@@ est receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy ghost .
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been sca@@ les : and he received sight forth@@ wi@@ th, and arose, and was baptized .
and when he had received meat, he was streng@@ the@@ ned . then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus .
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues, that he is the son of god .
but all that heard him were amazed, and said ; is not this he that destro@@ yed them which called on this name in jerusalem, and came hither for that int@@ ent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
but saul incre@@ ased the more in streng@@ th, and con@@ f@@ ounded the jews which dwelt at damasc@@ us, pro@@ ving that this is very christ .
and after that many days were fulfilled, the jews took counsel to kill him :
but their la@@ ying a@@ wait was known of saul . and they watched the ga@@ tes day and night to kill him .
then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the w@@ all in a baske@@ t .
and when saul was come to jerusalem, he as@@ say@@ ed to jo@@ in himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple .
but barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached bold@@ ly at damascus in the name of jesus .
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem .
and he spake bold@@ ly in the name of the lord jesus, and dispu@@ ted against the gre@@ ci@@ ans : but they went about to slay him .
which when the brethren kne@@ w, they brought him down to caesa@@ rea, and sent him forth to tar@@ sus .
then had the chur@@ ches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria, and were e@@ di@@ fied ; and walking in the fear of the lord, and in the comfor@@ t of the holy ghost, were multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and it came to pass, as peter passed throughout all qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, he came down also to the sa@@ ints which dwelt at ly@@ d@@ da .
and there he found a certain man named a@@ ene@@ as, which had kept his bed ei@@ ght years, and was sick of the pal@@ sy .
and peter said unto him, a@@ ene@@ as, jesus christ ma@@ keth thee whole : arise, and make thy bed . and he arose immediately .
and all that dwelt at ly@@ d@@ da and sa@@ r@@ on saw him, and turned to the lord .
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named ta@@ bi@@ tha, which by interpre@@ tation is called d@@ or@@ c@@ as : this woman was full of good works and al@@ m@@ s@@ deeds which she did .
and it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died : whom when they had washe@@ d, they laid her in an upper cha@@ mber .
and forasmuch as ly@@ d@@ da was nigh to jo@@ ppa, and the disciples had heard that peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not de@@ lay to come to them .
then peter arose and went with them . when he was come, they brought him into the upper cha@@ mber : and all the widows stood by him weep@@ ing, and she@@ wing the coa@@ ts and garments which d@@ or@@ c@@ as ma@@ de, while she was with them .
but peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed ; and tur@@ ning him to the body said, ta@@ bi@@ tha, arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw peter, she sat up .
and he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the sa@@ ints and widow@@ s, presen@@ ted her a@@ live .
and it was known throughout all joppa ; and many believed in the lord .
and it came to pass, that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tan@@ ner .
there was a certain man in caesarea called corneli@@ us, a centurion of the band called the i@@ ta@@ li@@ an band ,
a devout man, and one that feared god with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to god al@@ way .
he saw in a vision evi@@ den@@ tly about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him, and saying unto him, cornelius .
and when he looked on him, he was afrai@@ d, and said, what is it, lord ? and he said unto him, thy pray@@ ers and thine alms are come up for a me@@ mor@@ i@@ al before god .
and now send men to jo@@ ppa, and call for one simon, whose surname is peter :
he lod@@ ge@@ th with one simon a tan@@ n@@ er, whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou ou@@ ght@@ est to do .
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed, he called two of his house@@ hold servants, and a devout soldi@@ er of them that waited on him continu@@ al@@ ly ;
and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to joppa .
on the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, peter went up upon the house@@ top to pray about the sixth hour :
and he be@@ came very hun@@ gr@@ y, and would have eaten : but while they made ready, he fell into a tr@@ ance ,
and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descen@@ ding upon him, as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ n@@ ers, and let down to the earth :
wherein were all manner of four@@ foo@@ ted be@@ asts of the earth, and wi@@ ld be@@ ast@@ s, and cre@@ ep@@ ing things, and fowls of the air .
and there came a voice to him, rise, peter ; ki@@ ll, and eat .
but peter said, not so, lord ; for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
and the voice spake unto him again the second time, what god hath clean@@ sed, that call not thou common .
this was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
now while peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should me@@ an, behold, the men which were sent from cornelius had made enqui@@ ry for simon 's house, and stood before the gate ,
and called, and asked whether simon, which was surnamed peter, were lodged there .
while peter thought on the visi@@ on, the spirit said unto him, behold, three men seek thee .
arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doub@@ ting nothing : for i have sent them .
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius ; and said, behold, i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and they said, cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fea@@ reth god, and of good re@@ port among all the nation of the jews, was war@@ ned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee .
then called he them in, and lodged them . and on the morrow peter went away with them, and certain brethren from joppa accomp@@ ani@@ ed him .
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea . and cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kin@@ s@@ men and near friends .
and as peter was coming in, cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him .
but peter took him up, saying, stand up ; i myself also am a man .
and as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together .
and he said unto them, ye know how that it is an un@@ lawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep comp@@ an@@ y, or come unto one of another nation ; but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean .
therefore came i unto you without ga@@ in@@ saying, as soon as i was sent for : i ask therefore for what int@@ ent ye have sent for me ?
and cornelius said, four days a@@ go i was fa@@ sting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in b@@ right clo@@ thing ,
and said, corneli@@ us, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance in the sight of god .
send therefore to jo@@ ppa, and call hither simon, whose surname is peter ; he is lodged in the house of one simon a tan@@ ner by the sea side : who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee .
immediately therefore i sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before god, to hear all things that are commanded thee of god .
then peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth i perceive that god is no re@@ spe@@ c@@ ter of per@@ sons :
but in every nation he that fea@@ reth him, and wor@@ keth righteousness, is ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted with him .
the word which god sent unto the children of israel, preaching peace by jesus christ : 
that word, i say, ye know, which was publi@@ shed throughout all judaea, and began from galilee, after the baptism which john preached ;
how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power : who went about do@@ ing good, and healing all that were op@@ pre@@ ssed of the devil ; for god was with him .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews, and in jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
him god raised up the third day, and shewed him openly ;
not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before god, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of qui@@ ck and dead .
to him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins .
while peter yet spake these words, the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
and they of the circumci@@ sion which believed were astoni@@ shed, as many as came with peter, because that on the gentiles also was p@@ oured out the gift of the holy ghost .
for they heard them speak with tongu@@ es, and mag@@ ni@@ fy god . then answered peter ,
can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy ghost as well as we ?
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god .
and when peter was come up to jerusalem, they that were of the circumci@@ sion cont@@ en@@ ded with him ,
saying, thou w@@ en@@ test in to men un@@ circumci@@ sed, and didst eat with them .
but peter re@@ hear@@ sed the matter from the begin@@ ning, and ex@@ p@@ ounded it by or@@ der unto them, saying ,
i was in the city of joppa pra@@ ying : and in a tr@@ ance i saw a visi@@ on, a certain vessel descen@@ d, as it had been a great she@@ e@@ t, let down from heaven by four cor@@ ners ; and it came even to me :
upon the which when i had fast@@ ened mine eyes, i consi@@ de@@ red, and saw four@@ foo@@ ted be@@ asts of the earth, and wi@@ ld be@@ ast@@ s, and cre@@ ep@@ ing things, and fowls of the air .
and i heard a voice saying unto me, arise, peter ; slay and eat .
but i said, not so, lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
but the voice answered me again from heaven, what god hath clean@@ sed, that call not thou common .
and this was done three times : and all were dra@@ wn up again into heaven .
and, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was, sent from caesarea unto me .
and the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doub@@ ting . moreover these six brethren accomp@@ ani@@ ed me, and we entered into the man 's house :
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, send men to jo@@ ppa, and call for simon, whose surname is peter ;
who shall tell thee words, where@@ by thou and all thy house shall be saved .
and as i began to speak, the holy ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning .
then remembered i the word of the lord, how that he said, john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost .
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the lord jesus christ ; what was i, that i could with@@ stand god ?
when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified god, saying, then hath god also to the gentiles gran@@ ted repentance unto life .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecu@@ tion that arose about stephe@@ n tra@@ ve@@ lled as far as phe@@ ni@@ ce, and cyp@@ ru@@ s, and antio@@ ch, preaching the word to none but unto the jews only .
and some of them were men of cyp@@ r@@ us and cy@@ ren@@ e, which, when they were come to antio@@ ch, spake unto the gre@@ ci@@ ans, preaching the lord jesus .
and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number believed, and turned unto the lord .
then tid@@ ings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas, that he should go as far as antioch .
who, when he came, and had seen the grace of god, was gla@@ d, and exhor@@ ted them all, that with purpo@@ se of heart they would c@@ leave unto the lord .
for he was a good man, and full of the holy ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
then departed barnabas to tar@@ sus, for to seek saul :
and when he had found him, he brought him unto antioch . and it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people . and the disciples were called chri@@ sti@@ ans first in antioch .
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
and there stood up one of them named aga@@ bu@@ s, and signi@@ fied by the spirit that there should be great de@@ ar@@ th throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of c@@ lau@@ di@@ us caesar .
then the disciples, every man according to his abi@@ li@@ ty, determined to send re@@ lie@@ f unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea :
which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul .
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to ve@@ x certain of the church .
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
and because he saw it pleased the jews, he proce@@ e@@ ded further to take peter also . 
and when he had ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ ded him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four qua@@ ter@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; int@@ en@@ ding after e@@ as@@ ter to bring him forth to the people .
peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ce@@ as@@ ing of the church unto god for him .
and when herod would have brought him forth, the same night peter was sle@@ ep@@ ing between two soldiers, bound with two cha@@ ins : and the kee@@ pers before the door kept the prison .
and, behold, the angel of the lord came upon him, and a light shi@@ ned in the prison : and he smote peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, arise up quick@@ ly . and his cha@@ ins fell off from his hands .
and the angel said unto him, gi@@ rd thyself, and bind on thy s@@ and@@ al@@ s . and so he did . and he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee, and follow me .
and he went out, and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
when they were pa@@ st the first and the second ward, they came unto the i@@ r@@ on gate that lea@@ deth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out, and passed on through one stre@@ et ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
and when peter was come to himself, he said, now i know of a sure@@ ty, that the lord hath sent his ange@@ l, and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod, and from all the expe@@ c@@ tation of the people of the jews .
and when he had consi@@ dered the thing, he came to the house of mary the mother of john, whose surname was mar@@ k ; where many were gathered together pra@@ ying .
and as peter kno@@ cked at the door of the ga@@ te, a damsel came to hear@@ ken, named r@@ ho@@ da .
and when she knew peter 's voice, she opened not the gate for gla@@ d@@ ness, but ran in, and told how peter stood before the gate .
and they said unto her, thou art ma@@ d . but she con@@ stan@@ tly af@@ fir@@ med that it was even so . then said they, it is his angel .
but peter continued kno@@ c@@ king : and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished .
but he, beck@@ oning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said, go shew these things unto james, and to the brethren . and he departed, and went into another place .
now as soon as it was day, there was no small sti@@ r among the soldiers, what was become of peter .
and when herod had sought for him, and found him not, he exa@@ mined the kee@@ pers, and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from judaea to caesa@@ rea, and there abode .
and herod was high@@ ly disp@@ leased with them of tyre and sid@@ on : but they came with one accord to him, and, having made bla@@ st@@ us the king 's cha@@ mb@@ er@@ la@@ in their friend, desired peace ; because their country was n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed by the king 's country .
and upon a set day herod, ar@@ ra@@ yed in ro@@ y@@ al ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l, sat upon his thr@@ one, and made an or@@ ation unto them .
and the people gave a shou@@ t, saying, it is the voice of a god, and not of a man .
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him, because he gave not god the glory : and he was eaten of wor@@ ms, and gave up the ghost .
but the word of god gre@@ w and multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their mini@@ str@@ y, and took with them john, whose surname was mar@@ k .
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teac@@ he@@ rs ; as barnabas, and si@@ me@@ on that was called ni@@ g@@ er, and lu@@ ci@@ us of cy@@ ren@@ e, and man@@ a@@ en, which had been brought up with herod the tetrar@@ ch, and saul .
as they ministered to the lord, and f@@ as@@ ted, the holy ghost said, se@@ para@@ te me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
and when they had fast@@ ed and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away .
so they, being sent forth by the holy ghost, departed unto sele@@ u@@ ci@@ a ; and from thence they sailed to cyp@@ r@@ us .
and when they were at sa@@ la@@ mi@@ s, they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john to their minister .
and when they had gone through the is@@ le unto pa@@ p@@ ho@@ s, they found a certain sor@@ ce@@ re@@ r, a false prophet, a jew@@ , whose name was bar@@ jesus :
which was with the de@@ pu@@ ty of the country, ser@@ gi@@ us pa@@ ul@@ us, a p@@ ru@@ d@@ ent man ; who called for barnabas and saul, and desired to hear the word of god .
but el@@ y@@ m@@ as the sor@@ ce@@ re@@ r with@@ stood them, seeking to turn away the de@@ pu@@ ty from the faith .
then saul, filled with the holy ghost, set his eyes on him .
and said, o full of all sub@@ ti@@ l@@ ty and all mis@@ chi@@ e@@ f, thou child of the devil, thou ene@@ my of all righteousness, wilt thou not ce@@ ase to perver@@ t the right ways of the lord ?
and now, behold, the hand of the lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mi@@ st and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
then the de@@ pu@@ ty, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the lord .
now when paul and his company loosed from pa@@ p@@ ho@@ s, they came to per@@ g@@ a in pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a : and john depar@@ ting from them returned to jerusalem .
but when they departed from per@@ ga@@ , they came to antioch in pi@@ si@@ di@@ a, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down .
and after the rea@@ ding of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhor@@ tation for the people, say on .
then paul stood up, and beck@@ oning with his hand said, men of israel, and ye that fear god, give au@@ di@@ ence .
the god of this people of israel cho@@ se our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt, and with an high ar@@ m brought he them out of it .
and about the time of forty years suffered he their man@@ ners in the wilderness .
and when he had destro@@ yed seven nations in the land of chan@@ a@@ an, he divided their land to them by lot .
and after that he gave unto them jud@@ ges about the space of four hundred and fif@@ ty years, until sa@@ mu@@ el the prophet .
and afterward they desired a king : and god gave unto them saul the son of ci@@ s, a man of the tri@@ be of b@@ en@@ ja@@ min@@ , by the space of forty years .
and when he had re@@ moved him, he raised up unto them david to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimon@@ y, and said, i have found david the son of jes@@ se, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfi@@ l all my will .
of this man 's seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a sa@@ vi@@ our, jesus :
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
and as john fulfilled his cour@@ se, he said, whom think ye that i am ? i am not he . but, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose .
men and brethren, children of the sto@@ ck of abraham, and whosoever among you fea@@ reth god, to you is the word of this salvation sent .
for they that dwell at jerusalem, and their rul@@ ers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voi@@ ces of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condem@@ ning him .
and though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they pilate that he should be slain .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre .
but god raised him from the dead :
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people .
and we declare unto you glad tid@@ ings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up jesus again ; as it is also written in the second p@@ sal@@ m, thou art my son, this day have i be@@ gotten thee .
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corrup@@ tion, he said on this wise, i will give you the sure mer@@ ci@@ es of david .
wherefore he saith also in another p@@ sal@@ m, thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corrup@@ tion .
for david, after he had served his own generation by the will of god, fell on sle@@ ep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corrup@@ tion :
but he, whom god raised again, saw no corrup@@ tion .
be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins :
and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets ;
behold, ye despi@@ ser@@ s, and wond@@ er, and perish : for i work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you .
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue, the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
now when the con@@ gre@@ ga@@ tion was broken up, many of the jews and re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous pro@@ sel@@ y@@ tes followed paul and barnabas : who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continu@@ e in the grace of god .
and the next sabbath day came al@@ most the whole city together to hear the word of god .
but when the jews saw the multitu@@ des, they were filled with en@@ v@@ y, and spake against those things which were spoken by paul, cont@@ ra@@ di@@ c@@ ting and blasphe@@ m@@ ing .
then paul and barnabas waxed bo@@ ld, and said, it was ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry that the word of god should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves un@@ worthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the gentiles .
for so hath the lord commanded us, saying, i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the en@@ ds of the earth .
and when the gentiles heard this, they were gla@@ d, and glorified the word of the lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
and the word of the lord was publi@@ shed throughout all the region .
but the jews stirred up the devout and honou@@ ra@@ ble women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecu@@ tion against paul and barnabas, and expe@@ lled them out of their coasts .
but they sho@@ ok off the du@@ st of their feet against them, and came unto i@@ con@@ iu@@ m .
and the disciples were filled with jo@@ y, and with the holy ghost .
and it came to pass in i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed .
but the unbelie@@ ving jews stirred up the gentiles, and made their min@@ ds evil af@@ fe@@ cted against the brethren .
long time therefore abode they speaking bold@@ ly in the lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his gra@@ ce, and gran@@ ted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
but the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the jews, and part with the apostles .
and when there was an as@@ sa@@ ult made both of the gentiles, and also of the jews with their rul@@ ers, to use them despi@@ te@@ ful@@ ly, and to stone them ,
they were ware of it, and fled unto ly@@ str@@ a and der@@ be, cities of ly@@ ca@@ oni@@ a, and unto the region that lie@@ th round about :
and there they preached the gospel .
and there sat a certain man at ly@@ stra@@ , im@@ po@@ t@@ ent in his feet, being a cri@@ pp@@ le from his mother 's wo@@ mb, who never had walked :
the same heard paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him, and percei@@ ving that he had faith to be healed ,
said with a loud voice, stand up@@ right on thy feet . and he lea@@ ped and walked .
and when the people saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voi@@ ces, saying in the speech of ly@@ ca@@ oni@@ a, the go@@ ds are come down to us in the li@@ k@@ en@@ ess of men .
and they called barnabas, j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ; and paul, mer@@ cu@@ ri@@ us, because he was the chief spea@@ ke@@ r .
then the priest of j@@ up@@ i@@ ter, which was before their city, brought o@@ x@@ en and gar@@ lan@@ ds unto the ga@@ tes, and would have done sacrifice with the people .
which when the apostles, barnabas and paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out ,
and saying, sirs, why do ye these things ? we also are men of like pas@@ sions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these van@@ i@@ ties unto the living god, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein :
who in times pa@@ st suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us ra@@ in from heaven, and fru@@ it@@ ful seas@@ ons, fi@@ l@@ ling our hearts with fo@@ od and gla@@ dness .
and with these sayings s@@ car@@ ce re@@ strained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, who persuaded the people, and having stoned paul, drew him out of the city, sup@@ pos@@ ing he had been dead .
howbe@@ it, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city : and the next day he departed with barnabas to der@@ be .
and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to ly@@ stra@@ , and to i@@ con@@ iu@@ m, and antioch ,
con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing the souls of the disciples, and exhor@@ ting them to continu@@ e in the faith, and that we must through much tribu@@ lation enter into the kingdom of god .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fast@@ ing, they com@@ men@@ ded them to the lord, on whom they believed .
and after they had passed throughout pi@@ si@@ di@@ a, they came to pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a .
and when they had preached the word in per@@ ga@@ , they went down into at@@ ta@@ li@@ a :
and thence sailed to antio@@ ch, from whence they had been re@@ com@@ men@@ ded to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled .
and when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they re@@ hear@@ sed all that god had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles .
and there they abode long time with the disciples .
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren, and said, except ye be circumci@@ sed after the manner of moses, ye cannot be saved .
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dis@@ sen@@ sion and dispu@@ tation with them, they determined that paul and barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church, they passed through phe@@ ni@@ ce and samaria, decl@@ aring the conver@@ sion of the gentiles : and they ca@@ used great joy unto all the brethren .
and when they were come to jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that god had done with them .
but there rose up certain of the se@@ ct of the pharisees which believed, saying, that it was nee@@ d@@ ful to circumci@@ se them, and to command them to keep the law of moses .
and the apostles and elders came together for to consi@@ der of this matter .
and when there had been much dispu@@ t@@ ing, peter rose up, and said unto them, men and brethren, ye know how that a good while a@@ go god made cho@@ i@@ ce among us, that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospe@@ l, and believe .
and god, which knoweth the hear@@ ts, bare them witness, gi@@ ving them the holy ghost, even as he did unto us ;
and put no di@@ ffe@@ re@@ nce between us and them, puri@@ fying their hearts by faith .
now therefore why tempt ye god, to put a y@@ o@@ ke upon the ne@@ ck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be sa@@ ved, even as they .
then all the multitude kept sil@@ en@@ ce, and gave au@@ di@@ ence to barnabas and paul, decl@@ aring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them .
and after they had held their peace, james answered, saying, men and brethren, hearken unto me :
si@@ me@@ on hath declared how god at the first did vi@@ sit the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name .
and to this agre@@ e the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
after this i will retur@@ n, and will build again the tabernac@@ le of david, which is fallen down ; and i will build again the ru@@ ins thereof, and i will set it up :
that the resi@@ du@@ e of men might seek after the lord, and all the gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the lord, who doeth all these things .
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world .
wherefore my sen@@ t@@ ence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the gentiles are turned to god :
but that we write unto them, that they ab@@ sta@@ in from pol@@ lu@@ tions of i@@ do@@ ls, and from forni@@ ca@@ tion, and from things strang@@ led, and from blood .
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas ; na@@ me@@ ly, judas surnamed bar@@ sa@@ bas and si@@ la@@ s, chief men among the brethren :
and they wrote le@@ tters by them after this manner ; the apostles and elders and brethren send gree@@ ting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syri@@ a and cilici@@ a .
forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, sub@@ ver@@ ting your sou@@ ls, saying, ye must be circumci@@ sed, and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accor@@ d, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
men that have ha@@ zar@@ ded their li@@ ves for the name of our lord jesus christ .
we have sent therefore judas and si@@ la@@ s, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
for it seemed good to the holy ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater bur@@ den than these ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry things ;
that ye ab@@ sta@@ in from me@@ a@@ ts offered to i@@ do@@ ls, and from blood, and from things strang@@ led, and from forni@@ cation : from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well . f@@ are ye well .
so when they were dis@@ mis@@ sed, they came to antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the e@@ pi@@ st@@ le :
which when they had rea@@ d, they rejoiced for the con@@ so@@ lation .
and judas and si@@ la@@ s, being prophets also themselves, exhor@@ ted the brethren with many words, and con@@ fir@@ med them .
and after they had tarried there a sp@@ ac@@ e, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
notwith@@ standing it pleased silas to abide there still .
paul also and barnabas continued in antio@@ ch, teaching and preaching the word of the lord, with many others also .
and some days after paul said unto barnabas, let us go again and vi@@ sit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord, and see how they do .
and barnabas determined to take with them john, whose surname was mar@@ k .
but paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, and went not with them to the work .
and the cont@@ en@@ tion was so sha@@ r@@ p between them, that they departed as@@ under one from the other : and so barnabas took mar@@ k, and sailed unto cyp@@ r@@ us ;
and paul cho@@ se si@@ la@@ s, and departed, being re@@ com@@ men@@ ded by the brethren unto the grace of god .
and he went through syri@@ a and cilici@@ a, con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing the chur@@ ches .
then came he to der@@ be and ly@@ str@@ a : and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named timothe@@ us, the son of a certain woman, which was a jew@@ es@@ s, and believed ; but his father was a gree@@ k :
which was well re@@ por@@ ted of by the brethren that were at ly@@ str@@ a and i@@ con@@ iu@@ m .
him would paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumci@@ sed him because of the jews which were in those qu@@ ar@@ ters : for they knew all that his father was a gree@@ k .
and as they went through the ci@@ ties, they delivered them the de@@ cre@@ es for to ke@@ ep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem .
and so were the chur@@ ches esta@@ bli@@ shed in the faith, and incre@@ ased in number daily .
now when they had gone throughout ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a and the region of ga@@ la@@ ti@@ a, and were for@@ bidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia ,
after they were come to my@@ si@@ a, they as@@ say@@ ed to go into bi@@ th@@ y@@ ni@@ a : but the spirit suffered them not .
and they pas@@ sing by my@@ si@@ a came down to tro@@ as .
and a vision appeared to paul in the night ; there stood a man of macedonia, and prayed him, saying, come over into macedonia, and help us .
and after he had seen the visi@@ on, immediately we en@@ dea@@ v@@ oured to go into macedonia, as@@ sure@@ dly ga@@ ther@@ ing that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
therefore loo@@ sing from tro@@ as, we came with a straight course to sa@@ mo@@ th@@ ra@@ ci@@ a, and the next day to ne@@ apo@@ l@@ is ;
and from thence to phili@@ p@@ pi@@ , which is the chief city of that part of macedonia, and a co@@ lon@@ y : and we were in that city abi@@ ding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a ri@@ ver side, where prayer was won@@ t to be made ; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resor@@ ted thither .
and a certain woman named ly@@ di@@ a, a sel@@ ler of pur@@ ple, of the city of th@@ y@@ a@@ ti@@ ra@@ , which worshipped god, heard us : whose heart the lord opened, that she a@@ tt@@ en@@ ded unto the things which were spoken of paul .
and when she was baptized, and her househo@@ ld, she besought us, saying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord, come into my house, and abide there . and she con@@ strained us .
and it came to pass, as we went to pray@@ er, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of di@@ vin@@ ation met us, which brought her masters much ga@@ in by so@@ o@@ th@@ saying :
the same followed paul and us, and cried, saying, these men are the servants of the most high god, which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and this did she many days . but paul, being grie@@ ved, turned and said to the spirit, i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their ga@@ ins was g@@ one, they caught paul and si@@ la@@ s, and drew them into the marke@@ t@@ place unto the rulers ,
and brought them to the magistra@@ tes, saying, these men, being jews, do excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly trouble our city ,
and teach custo@@ ms, which are not lawful for us to recei@@ ve, neither to ob@@ ser@@ ve, being roman@@ s .
and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistra@@ tes rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them .
and when they had laid many stri@@ pes upon them, they cast them into prison, char@@ ging the ja@@ i@@ l@@ or to keep them sa@@ fe@@ ly :
who, having received such a char@@ ge, thrust them into the in@@ ner prison, and made their feet fast in the sto@@ c@@ ks .
and at mid@@ night paul and silas prayed, and san@@ g p@@ rai@@ ses unto god : and the prison@@ ers heard them .
and suddenly there was a great earth@@ qua@@ ke, so that the founda@@ tions of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one 's b@@ an@@ ds were loosed .
and the kee@@ per of the prison a@@ wa@@ king out of his sle@@ ep, and seeing the prison doors op@@ en, he drew out his s@@ word, and would have killed himself, sup@@ pos@@ ing that the prison@@ ers had been fled .
but paul cried with a loud voice, saying, do thyself no har@@ m : for we are all here .
then he called for a light, and sp@@ ran@@ g in, and came tremb@@ ling, and fell down before paul and silas ,
and brought them out, and said, sirs, what must i do to be saved ?
and they said, believe on the lord jesus christ, and thou shalt be sa@@ ved, and thy house .
and they spake unto him the word of the lord, and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stri@@ pes ; and was baptized, he and all hi@@ s, straightway .
and when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoi@@ ce@@ d, belie@@ ving in god with all his house .
and when it was day, the magistra@@ tes sent the ser@@ je@@ an@@ ts, saying, let those men go .
and the kee@@ per of the prison told this saying to paul, the magistra@@ tes have sent to let you go : now therefore depar@@ t, and go in peace .
but paul said unto them, they have be@@ ate@@ n us openly un@@ condem@@ ned, being roman@@ s, and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out pri@@ vi@@ ly ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fe@@ tch us out .
and the ser@@ je@@ an@@ ts told these words unto the magistra@@ tes : and they fea@@ red, when they heard that they were roman@@ s .
and they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of ly@@ di@@ a : and when they had seen the brethren, they comfor@@ ted them, and departed .
now when they had passed through am@@ phi@@ pol@@ is and apo@@ l@@ loni@@ a, they came to thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , where was a synagogue of the jews :
and paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
open@@ ing and al@@ le@@ g@@ ing, that christ must needs have suffe@@ red, and risen again from the dead ; and that this jesus, whom i preach unto you, is christ .
and some of them believed, and con@@ sor@@ ted with paul and silas ; and of the devout greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few .
but the jews which believed not, moved with en@@ v@@ y, took unto them certain le@@ w@@ d fellow@@ s of the ba@@ se@@ r sor@@ t, and gathered a comp@@ an@@ y, and set all the city on an upro@@ ar, and as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted the house of j@@ as@@ on, and sought to bring them out to the people .
and when they found them not, they drew j@@ as@@ on and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, c@@ ry@@ ing, these that have turned the world up@@ side down are come hither also ;
whom j@@ as@@ on hath received : and these all do contrary to the de@@ cre@@ es of caesar, saying that there is another king, one jesus .
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things .
and when they had taken secu@@ ri@@ ty of j@@ as@@ on, and of the o@@ ther, they let them go .
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto be@@ rea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews .
these were more no@@ ble than those in thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , in that they received the word with all rea@@ d@@ in@@ ess of min@@ d, and se@@ ar@@ ched the scriptures dai@@ ly, whether those things were so .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honou@@ ra@@ ble women which were gree@@ ks, and of men, not a few .
but when the jews of thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ c@@ a had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at be@@ rea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea : but silas and timothe@@ us abode there still .
and they that con@@ du@@ cted paul brought him unto a@@ the@@ ns : and recei@@ ving a commandment unto silas and timothe@@ us for to come to him with all spe@@ ed, they departed .
now while paul waited for them at a@@ then@@ s, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city who@@ l@@ ly given to i@@ do@@ la@@ tr@@ y .
therefore dispu@@ ted he in the synagogue with the jews, and with the devout per@@ s@@ ons, and in the marke@@ t daily with them that met with him .
then certain phi@@ lo@@ so@@ phe@@ rs of the e@@ pi@@ cu@@ re@@ ans, and of the sto@@ i@@ ck@@ s, en@@ coun@@ tered him . and some said, what will this b@@ ab@@ b@@ ler say ? other so@@ me, he see@@ meth to be a se@@ tter forth of stran@@ ge go@@ ds : because he preached unto them jesus, and the resurrection .
and they took him, and brought him unto a@@ re@@ o@@ pa@@ g@@ us, saying, may we know what this new doctr@@ in@@ e, whereof thou spea@@ k@@ est, is ?
for thou bring@@ est certain stran@@ ge things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .

then paul stood in the midst of mar@@ s ' hi@@ ll, and said, ye men of a@@ then@@ s, i perceive that in all things ye are to@@ o super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous .
for as i passed by, and beheld your de@@ vo@@ tions, i found an al@@ ta@@ r with this in@@ scri@@ pti@@ on, to the unknown god . whom therefore ye i@@ gn@@ or@@ an@@ tly wor@@ ship, him declare i unto you .
god that made the world and all things there@@ in, seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth, dwel@@ leth not in tem@@ ple@@ s made with hands ;
neither is worshipped with men 's hands, as though he nee@@ ded any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and brea@@ th, and all things ;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appoin@@ ted, and the b@@ oun@@ ds of their ha@@ bi@@ tation ;
that they should seek the lord, if ha@@ ply they might fee@@ l after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us :
for in him we li@@ ve, and mo@@ ve, and have our being ; as certain also of your own po@@ e@@ ts have said, for we are also his off@@ sp@@ ring .
forasmuch then as we are the off@@ sp@@ ring of god, we ought not to think that the go@@ d@@ head is like unto go@@ ld, or sil@@ ver, or st@@ one, gra@@ ven by art and man 's devi@@ ce .
and the times of this i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance god win@@ ked at ; but now comman@@ deth all men every where to repent :
because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given as@@ sur@@ ance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead .
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked : and others said, we will hear thee again of this matter .
so paul departed from among them .
howbeit certain men c@@ la@@ ve unto him, and believed : among the which was di@@ on@@ y@@ si@@ us the a@@ re@@ o@@ pa@@ gi@@ te, and a woman named da@@ mar@@ is, and others with them .
after these things paul departed from a@@ then@@ s, and came to cor@@ in@@ th ;
and found a certain jew named a@@ qui@@ la@@ , born in pon@@ tus, la@@ te@@ ly come from i@@ tal@@ y, with his wife pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a ; and came unto them .
and because he was of the same cra@@ f@@ t, he abode with them, and wrought : for by their o@@ c@@ c@@ up@@ ation they were ten@@ t@@ ma@@ k@@ ers .
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabba@@ th, and persuaded the jews and the greeks .
and when silas and timothe@@ us were come from macedonia, paul was pre@@ ssed in the spirit, and testi@@ fied to the jews that jesus was christ .
and when they op@@ po@@ sed themselves, and blasphe@@ med, he sho@@ ok his rai@@ ment, and said unto them, your blood be upon your own hea@@ ds ; i am clean ; from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles .
and he departed thence, and entered into a certain man 's house, named ju@@ st@@ us, one that worshipped god, whose house jo@@ ined hard to the synagogue .
and cri@@ sp@@ us, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the lord with all his house ; and many of the cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans hearing believed, and were baptized .
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a visi@@ on, be not afrai@@ d, but speak, and hold not thy peace :
for i am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hu@@ r@@ t thee : for i have much people in this city .
and he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of god among them .
and when ga@@ l@@ li@@ o was the de@@ pu@@ ty of acha@@ i@@ a, the jews made in@@ surre@@ ction with one accord against paul, and brought him to the judgment seat ,
saying, this fellow persua@@ deth men to worship god contrary to the law .
and when paul was now about to open his mouth, ga@@ l@@ li@@ o said unto the jews, if it were a matter of wr@@ ong or wicked le@@ w@@ d@@ ness, o ye jews, reason would that i should bear with you :
but if it be a question of words and na@@ mes, and of your law, look ye to it ; for i will be no judge of such mat@@ ters .
and he dra@@ ve them from the judgment seat .
then all the greeks took so@@ s@@ then@@ es, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat . and ga@@ l@@ li@@ o ca@@ red for none of those things .
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into syri@@ a, and with him pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a and a@@ qui@@ l@@ a ; having shor@@ n his head in cen@@ ch@@ rea : for he had a vo@@ w .
and he came to ephe@@ sus, and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the jews .
when they desired him to tarry lon@@ ger time with them, he con@@ sen@@ ted not ;
but bade them fa@@ re@@ well, saying, i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem : but i will return again unto you, if god will . and he sailed from ephe@@ sus .
and when he had lan@@ ded at caesa@@ rea, and gone up, and salu@@ ted the church, he went down to antioch .
and after he had sp@@ ent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of ga@@ la@@ ti@@ a and ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a in or@@ d@@ er, streng@@ the@@ ning all the disciples .
and a certain jew named apo@@ llo@@ s, born at alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a, an e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ent man, and mighty in the scriptu@@ res, came to ephe@@ sus .
this man was inst@@ ru@@ cted in the way of the lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in the spirit, he spake and taught di@@ ligen@@ tly the things of the lord, knowing only the baptism of john .
and he began to speak bold@@ ly in the synagogue : whom when a@@ qui@@ l@@ a and pris@@ ci@@ ll@@ a had heard, they took him unto them, and ex@@ p@@ ounded unto him the way of god more perfec@@ tly .
and when he was di@@ spo@@ sed to pass into acha@@ i@@ a, the brethren wro@@ te, exhor@@ ting the disciples to receive him : who, when he was come, hel@@ ped them much which had believed through grace :
for he migh@@ ti@@ ly con@@ vin@@ ced the jews, and that publi@@ ck@@ ly, she@@ wing by the scriptures that jesus was christ .
and it came to pass, that, while apo@@ llo@@ s was at cor@@ in@@ th, paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephe@@ sus : and fin@@ ding certain disciples ,
he said unto them, have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost .
and he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized ? and they said, unto john 's baptism .
then said paul, john verily baptized with the baptism of repen@@ tan@@ ce, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on christ jesus .
when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
and when paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongu@@ es, and prophesi@@ ed .
and all the men were about twelve .
and he went into the synagogue, and spake bold@@ ly for the space of three months, dispu@@ ting and persua@@ ding the things concerning the kingdom of god .
but when divers were har@@ den@@ ed, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and se@@ para@@ ted the disciples, dispu@@ ting daily in the s@@ cho@@ ol of one ty@@ ran@@ n@@ us .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus, both jews and greeks .
and god wrought spe@@ ci@@ al miracles by the hands of paul :
so that from his body were brought unto the sick han@@ d@@ k@@ er@@ chi@@ e@@ f@@ s or ap@@ r@@ ons, and the disea@@ ses departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them .
then certain of the v@@ aga@@ bon@@ d jews, ex@@ or@@ ci@@ st@@ s, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus, saying, we ad@@ ju@@ re you by jesus whom paul prea@@ che@@ th .
and there were seven sons of one s@@ ce@@ v@@ a, a jew@@ , and chief of the priests, which did so .
and the evil spirit answered and said, jesus i know, and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
and the man in whom the evil spirit was lea@@ ped on them, and over@@ came them, and pre@@ vai@@ led against them, so that they fled out of that house na@@ ked and w@@ ounded .
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwel@@ ling at ephe@@ sus ; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the lord jesus was mag@@ ni@@ fied .
and many that believed came, and confes@@ sed, and shewed their deeds .
many of them also which used cu@@ ri@@ ous ar@@ ts brought their boo@@ ks together, and bur@@ ned them before all men : and they counted the pri@@ ce of them, and found it fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
so migh@@ ti@@ ly gre@@ w the word of god and pre@@ vai@@ led .
after these things were en@@ ded, paul purpo@@ sed in the spirit, when he had passed through macedoni@@ a and acha@@ i@@ a, to go to jerusalem, saying, after i have been there, i must also see ro@@ me .
so he sent into macedoni@@ a two of them that ministered unto him, timothe@@ us and er@@ ast@@ us ; but he himself sta@@ yed in asia for a season .
and the same time there arose no small sti@@ r about that way .
for a certain man named de@@ me@@ tri@@ us, a sil@@ ver@@ smi@@ th, which made silver sh@@ rin@@ es for di@@ an@@ a, brought no small ga@@ in unto the cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men ;
whom he called together with the wor@@ k@@ men of like o@@ c@@ c@@ up@@ a@@ tion, and said, sirs, ye know that by this cra@@ ft we have our we@@ al@@ th .
moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at ephe@@ sus, but al@@ most throughout all asi@@ a, this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no go@@ ds, which are made with hands :
so that not only this our cra@@ ft is in danger to be set at n@@ ought ; but also that the temple of the great go@@ d@@ des@@ s di@@ an@@ a should be despi@@ sed, and her mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cen@@ ce should be destro@@ ye@@ d, whom all asia and the world worshi@@ p@@ peth .
and when they heard these sayings, they were full of wra@@ th, and cried out, saying, great is di@@ an@@ a of the ephe@@ si@@ ans .
and the whole city was filled with con@@ fu@@ sion : and having caught ga@@ i@@ us and ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us, men of macedonia, paul 's comp@@ ani@@ ons in tra@@ ve@@ l, they ru@@ shed with one accord into the the@@ at@@ re .
and when paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not .
and certain of the chief of asi@@ a, which were his frien@@ ds, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not ad@@ ven@@ ture himself into the the@@ at@@ re .
some therefore cried one thing, and some another : for the assemb@@ ly was con@@ fu@@ sed : and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
and they drew alex@@ an@@ der out of the multitude, the jews pu@@ tting him for@@ ward . and alex@@ an@@ der beck@@ oned with the hand, and would have made his de@@ f@@ ence unto the people .
but when they knew that he was a jew@@ , all with one voice about the space of two hou@@ rs cried out, great is di@@ an@@ a of the ephe@@ si@@ ans .
and when the tow@@ n@@ c@@ ler@@ k had appe@@ ased the people, he said, ye men of ephe@@ sus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephe@@ si@@ ans is a worshi@@ p@@ per of the great go@@ d@@ des@@ s di@@ an@@ a, and of the image which fell down from j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ?
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken again@@ st, ye ought to be qui@@ e@@ t, and to do nothing ra@@ sh@@ ly .
for ye have brought hither these men, which are neither ro@@ b@@ b@@ ers of chur@@ che@@ s, nor yet blasphe@@ m@@ ers of your go@@ d@@ des@@ s .
wherefore if de@@ me@@ tri@@ us, and the cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is op@@ en, and there are de@@ pu@@ ties : let them im@@ ple@@ ad one another .
but if ye enquire any thing concerning other mat@@ ter@@ s, it shall be determined in a lawful assemb@@ ly .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's upro@@ ar, there being no cause where@@ by we may give an ac@@ coun@@ t of this con@@ course .
and when he had thus spoken, he dis@@ mis@@ sed the assemb@@ ly .
and after the upro@@ ar was cea@@ sed, paul called unto him the disciples, and e@@ mb@@ rac@@ ed them, and departed for to go into macedoni@@ a .
and when he had gone over those par@@ ts, and had given them much exhor@@ tation, he came into gree@@ ce ,
and there abode three month@@ s . and when the jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into syri@@ a, he purpo@@ sed to return through macedoni@@ a .
and there accomp@@ ani@@ ed him into asia so@@ pa@@ ter of be@@ rea ; and of the thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ans, ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us and se@@ c@@ und@@ us ; and ga@@ i@@ us of der@@ be, and timothe@@ us ; and of asi@@ a, ty@@ chi@@ c@@ us and tro@@ phi@@ m@@ us .
these going before tarried for us at tro@@ as .
and we sailed away from phili@@ pp@@ i after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to tro@@ as in five days ; where we abode seven days .
and upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to brea@@ k bread, paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until mid@@ night .
and there were many li@@ gh@@ ts in the upper cha@@ mb@@ er, where they were gathered together .
and there sat in a win@@ dow a certain young man named e@@ u@@ ty@@ ch@@ us, being fallen into a de@@ ep sleep : and as paul was long prea@@ chi@@ ng, he sun@@ k down with sle@@ ep, and fell down from the third lo@@ f@@ t, and was taken up dead .
and paul went down, and fell on him, and e@@ mb@@ rac@@ ing him said, trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
when he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and ea@@ t@@ en, and talked a long while, even till brea@@ k of day, so he departed .
and they brought the young man a@@ li@@ ve, and were not a little comfor@@ ted .
and we went before to ship, and sailed unto as@@ so@@ s, there int@@ en@@ ding to take in paul : for so had he appoin@@ ted, min@@ ding himself to go af@@ o@@ ot .
and when he met with us at as@@ so@@ s, we took him in, and came to mi@@ ty@@ len@@ e .
and we sailed thence, and came the next day over against chi@@ o@@ s ; and the next day we ar@@ ri@@ ved at sa@@ mo@@ s, and tarried at tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ u@@ m ; and the next day we came to mi@@ le@@ tus .
for paul had determined to sail by ephe@@ sus, because he would not sp@@ end the time in asia : for he ha@@ s@@ ted, if it were possible for him, to be at jerusalem the day of p@@ ente@@ co@@ st .
and from mi@@ le@@ tus he sent to ephe@@ sus, and called the elders of the church .
and when they were come to him, he said unto them, ye know, from the first day that i came into asi@@ a, after what manner i have been with you at all seas@@ ons ,
ser@@ ving the lord with all hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty of min@@ d, and with many te@@ ar@@ s, and temp@@ ta@@ tions, which be@@ fell me by the lying in wait of the jews :
and how i kept back nothing that was profi@@ table unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publi@@ ck@@ ly, and from house to house ,
testi@@ fying both to the jews, and also to the gree@@ ks, repentance toward god, and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
and now, behold, i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall be@@ fall me there :
save that the holy ghost witnes@@ seth in every city, saying that bon@@ ds and affli@@ c@@ tions abide me .
but none of these things move me, neither coun@@ t i my life dea@@ r unto myself, so that i might fin@@ ish my course with jo@@ y, and the mini@@ str@@ y, which i have received of the lord jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of god .
and now, behold, i know that ye all, among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god, shall see my face no more .
wherefore i take you to record this day, that i am pu@@ re from the blood of all men .
for i have not s@@ hun@@ ned to declare unto you all the counsel of god .
take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flo@@ ck, over the which the holy ghost hath made you over@@ se@@ ers, to fe@@ ed the church of god, which he hath pur@@ cha@@ sed with his own blood .
for i know this, that after my depar@@ ting shall grie@@ v@@ ous wol@@ ves enter in among you, not sp@@ aring the flo@@ ck .
also of your own sel@@ ves shall men arise, speaking perver@@ se things, to draw away disciples after them .
therefore wat@@ ch, and reme@@ mb@@ er, that by the space of three years i ce@@ ased not to war@@ n every one night and day with te@@ ar@@ s .
and now, brethren, i comm@@ end you to god, and to the word of his gra@@ ce, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sancti@@ fied .
i have cove@@ ted no man 's sil@@ ver, or go@@ ld, or ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l .
yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my ne@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ties, and to them that were with me .
i have shewed you all things, how that so lab@@ our@@ ing ye ought to sup@@ port the we@@ a@@ k, and to remember the words of the lord jesus, how he said, it is more blessed to give than to receive .
and when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all .
and they all wept so@@ re, and fell on paul 's ne@@ ck, and kis@@ sed him ,
sorrow@@ ing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more . and they accomp@@ ani@@ ed him unto the ship .
and it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had laun@@ che@@ d, we came with a straight course unto co@@ o@@ s, and the day following unto r@@ ho@@ des, and from thence unto pa@@ tar@@ a :
and fin@@ ding a ship sai@@ ling over unto phe@@ ni@@ ci@@ a, we went abo@@ ard, and set forth .
now when we had dis@@ co@@ vered cyp@@ ru@@ s, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into syri@@ a, and lan@@ ded at tyre : for there the ship was to un@@ la@@ de her bur@@ den .
and fin@@ ding disciples, we tarried there seven days : who said to paul through the spirit, that he should not go up to jerusalem .
and when we had accompli@@ shed those days, we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way, with wi@@ ves and children, till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the sho@@ re, and prayed .
and when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship ; and they returned home again .
and when we had fin@@ ished our course from ty@@ re, we came to p@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ is, and salu@@ ted the brethren, and abode with them one day .
and the next day we that were of paul 's company departed, and came unto caesarea : and we entered into the house of philip the e@@ van@@ ge@@ li@@ st, which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and the same man had four daugh@@ ter@@ s, virg@@ in@@ s, which did prophe@@ sy .
and as we tarried there many days, there came down from judaea a certain prophet, named aga@@ bu@@ s .
and when he was come unto us, he took paul 's gir@@ dle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, thus saith the holy ghost, so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that ow@@ ne@@ th this gir@@ dle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles .
and when we heard these things, both w@@ e, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
then paul answered, what mean ye to weep and to brea@@ k mine heart ? for i am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus .
and when he would not be persua@@ ded, we cea@@ sed, saying, the will of the lord be done .
and after those days we took up our car@@ ri@@ a@@ ges, and went up to jerusalem .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesa@@ rea, and brought with them one m@@ n@@ as@@ on of cyp@@ ru@@ s, an old disciple, with whom we should lo@@ dge .
and when we were come to jerusalem, the brethren received us gla@@ dly .
and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
and when he had salu@@ ted them, he declared par@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his mini@@ st@@ ry .
and when they heard it, they glorified the lord, and said unto him, thou se@@ est, brother, how many thous@@ an@@ ds of jews there are which believe ; and they are all ze@@ al@@ ous of the law :
and they are infor@@ med of thee, that thou teac@@ hest all the jews which are among the gentiles to for@@ sake moses, saying that they ought not to circumci@@ se their children, neither to walk after the custo@@ ms .
what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vo@@ w on them ;
them ta@@ ke, and puri@@ fy thyself with them, and be at char@@ ges with them, that they may sha@@ ve their hea@@ ds : and all may know that those things, whereof they were infor@@ med concerning thee, are nothing ; but that thou thyself also wal@@ kest or@@ der@@ ly, and ke@@ ep@@ est the law .
as touching the gentiles which believe, we have written and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that they ob@@ serve no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to i@@ do@@ ls, and from blood, and from strang@@ led, and from forni@@ cation .
then paul took the men, and the next day puri@@ fying himself with them entered into the temple, to signi@@ fy the accompli@@ sh@@ ment of the days of puri@@ fi@@ ca@@ tion, until that an off@@ ering should be offered for every one of them .
and when the seven days were al@@ most en@@ ded, the jews which were of asi@@ a, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him ,
crying out, men of israel, help : this is the man, that teac@@ he@@ th all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place : and further brought greeks also into the temple, and hath pol@@ lu@@ ted this holy place .

and all the city was mo@@ ved, and the people ran together : and they took paul, and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
and as they went about to kill him, tid@@ ings came unto the chief captain of the b@@ and, that all jerusalem was in an upro@@ ar .
who immediately took soldiers and centuri@@ ons, and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left bea@@ ting of paul .
then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two cha@@ ins ; and de@@ man@@ ded who he was, and what he had done .
and some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude : and when he could not know the cer@@ tain@@ ty for the tu@@ mul@@ t, he commanded him to be carried into the cast@@ le .
and when he came upon the sta@@ i@@ rs, so it was, that he was bor@@ ne of the soldiers for the viol@@ ence of the people .
for the multitude of the people followed af@@ ter, c@@ ry@@ ing, away with him .
and as paul was to be led into the cast@@ le, he said unto the chief cap@@ tain, may i speak unto thee ? who said, canst thou speak gree@@ k ?
art not thou that egy@@ pti@@ an, which before these days ma@@ dest an upro@@ ar, and le@@ d@@ dest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murde@@ rers ?
but paul said, i am a man which am a jew of tar@@ sus, a city in cilici@@ a, a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of no mean city : and, i besee@@ ch thee, suffer me to speak unto the people .
and when he had given him li@@ cen@@ ce, paul stood on the sta@@ i@@ rs, and beck@@ oned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ en@@ ce, he spake unto them in the hebre@@ w tongu@@ e, saying ,
men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my de@@ f@@ ence which i make now unto you .

i am verily a man which am a jew@@ , born in tar@@ sus, a city in cilici@@ a, yet brought up in this city at the feet of ga@@ ma@@ lie@@ l, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was ze@@ al@@ ous toward god, as ye all are this day .
and i persecuted this way unto the death, b@@ in@@ ding and deli@@ ver@@ ing into pri@@ sons both men and women .
as also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the esta@@ te of the elders : from whom also i received le@@ tters unto the brethren, and went to damasc@@ us, to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem, for to be p@@ un@@ ished .
and it came to pass, that, as i made my journey, and was come nigh unto damascus about no@@ on, suddenly there sh@@ one from heaven a great light round about me .
and i fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ?
and i answered, who art thou, lord ? and he said unto me, i am jesus of nazareth, whom thou persecutest .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and i said, what shall i do, lord ? and the lord said unto me, arise, and go into damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and when i could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, i came into damascus .
and one anani@@ as, a devout man according to the law, having a good re@@ port of all the jews which dwelt there ,
came unto me, and stoo@@ d, and said unto me, brother saul, receive thy sight . and the same hour i looked up upon him .
and he said, the god of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that just one, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and now why tar@@ ri@@ est thou ? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the lord .
and it came to pass, that, when i was come again to jerusalem, even while i prayed in the temple, i was in a tr@@ ance ;
and saw him saying unto me, make ha@@ ste@@ , and get thee quick@@ ly out of jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
and i said, lord, they know that i im@@ pris@@ oned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
and when the blood of thy mar@@ ty@@ r stephe@@ n was shed, i also was standing by, and con@@ sen@@ ting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
and he said unto me, depart : for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles .
and they gave him au@@ di@@ ence unto this word, and then lifted up their voi@@ ces, and said, away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not f@@ it that he should live .
and as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw du@@ st into the air ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the cast@@ le, and bade that he should be exa@@ mined by scour@@ ging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with th@@ on@@ g@@ s, paul said unto the centurion that stood by, is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a ro@@ man, and un@@ condemned ?
when the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief cap@@ tain, saying, take heed what thou doest : for this man is a ro@@ man .
then the chief captain came, and said unto him, tell me, art thou a ro@@ man ? he said, ye@@ a .
and the chief captain answered, with a great su@@ m ob@@ ta@@ ined i this fre@@ e@@ dom . and paul said, but i was free born .
then straightway they departed from him which should have exa@@ mined him : and the chief captain also was afrai@@ d, after he knew that he was a ro@@ man, and because he had bound him .
on the morrow, because he would have known the cer@@ tain@@ ty wherefore he was accused of the jews, he loosed him from his b@@ and@@ s, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appe@@ ar, and brought paul down, and set him before them .
and paul, ear@@ nes@@ tly beholding the council, said, men and brethren, i have li@@ ved in all good cons@@ ci@@ ence before god until this day .
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
then said paul unto him, god shall smite thee, thou whi@@ ted w@@ all : for si@@ tt@@ est thou to judge me after the law, and command@@ est me to be smi@@ tten contrary to the law ?
and they that stood by said, re@@ vi@@ lest thou god 's high priest ?
then said paul, i wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest : for it is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadduce@@ es, and the other pharisees, he cried out in the council, men and brethren, i am a pharise@@ e, the son of a pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question .
and when he had so said, there arose a dis@@ sen@@ sion between the pharisees and the sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
for the sadducees say that there is no resurre@@ ction, neither ange@@ l, nor spirit : but the pharisees confess both .
and there arose a great c@@ ry : and the scribes that were of the pharisees ' part arose, and st@@ ro@@ ve, saying, we find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fi@@ ght against god .
and when there arose a great dis@@ sen@@ sion, the chief cap@@ tain, fe@@ aring lest paul should have been p@@ ul@@ led in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by for@@ ce from among them, and to bring him into the cast@@ le .
and the night following the lord stood by him, and said, be of good che@@ er, paul : for as thou hast testi@@ fied of me in jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at ro@@ me .
and when it was day, certain of the jews b@@ an@@ ded together, and bound themselves under a cur@@ se, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul .
and they were more than forty which had made this con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y .
and they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, we have bound our@@ sel@@ ves under a great cur@@ se, that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul .
now therefore ye with the council signi@@ fy to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfec@@ tly concerning him : and w@@ e, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him .
and when paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wa@@ it, he went and entered into the cast@@ le, and told paul .
then paul called one of the centuri@@ ons unto him, and said, bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him, and brought him to the chief cap@@ tain, and said, paul the prison@@ er called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside private@@ ly, and asked him, what is that thou hast to tell me ?
and he said, the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire some@@ what of him more perfec@@ tly .
but do not thou y@@ i@@ e@@ ld unto them : for there li@@ e in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oa@@ th, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee .
so the chief captain then let the young man depar@@ t, and charged him, see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
and he called unto him two centuri@@ ons, saying, make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesa@@ rea, and hor@@ se@@ men thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and t@@ en, and spe@@ ar@@ men two hund@@ red, at the third hour of the night ;
and pro@@ vi@@ de them be@@ ast@@ s, that they may set paul on, and bring him sa@@ f@@ e unto felix the governor .
and he wrote a le@@ tter after this manner :
c@@ lau@@ di@@ us ly@@ sias unto the most exce@@ ll@@ ent governor felix sen@@ deth gree@@ ting .
this man was taken of the jews, and should have been killed of them : then came i with an ar@@ m@@ y, and re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed him, having understood that he was a ro@@ man .
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, i brought him forth into their council :
whom i perceived to be accused of questi@@ ons of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bon@@ ds .
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man, i sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accu@@ sers also to say before thee what they had against him . fa@@ re@@ well .
then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took paul, and brought him by night to anti@@ pa@@ tr@@ is .
on the morrow they left the hor@@ se@@ men to go with him, and returned to the cast@@ le :
who, when they came to caesarea and delivered the e@@ pi@@ st@@ le to the gover@@ n@@ or, presen@@ ted paul also before him .
and when the governor had read the le@@ t@@ ter, he asked of what pro@@ vin@@ ce he was . and when he understood that he was of cilici@@ a ;
i will hear thee, said he, when thine accu@@ sers are also come . and he commanded him to be kept in herod 's judgment ha@@ ll .
and after five days ananias the high priest descen@@ ded with the elders, and with a certain or@@ at@@ or named ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us, who infor@@ med the governor against paul .
and when he was called forth, ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us began to accuse him, saying, seeing that by thee we en@@ joy great qui@@ e@@ t@@ ness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy pro@@ vi@@ den@@ ce ,
we ac@@ ce@@ pt it al@@ ways, and in all places, most no@@ ble feli@@ x@@ , with all than@@ k@@ ful@@ ness .
notwith@@ standing, that i be not further te@@ di@@ ous unto thee, i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy cle@@ men@@ cy a few words .
for we have found this man a p@@ esti@@ l@@ ent fello@@ w, and a mo@@ ver of se@@ dition among all the jews throughout the world, and a r@@ ing@@ lea@@ der of the se@@ ct of the naza@@ re@@ ne@@ s :
who also hath gone about to pro@@ f@@ an@@ e the temple : whom we too@@ k, and would have judged according to our law .
but the chief captain ly@@ sias came upon us, and with great viol@@ ence took him away out of our hands ,
comman@@ ding his accu@@ sers to come unto thee : by exa@@ min@@ ing of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him .
and the jews also as@@ s@@ ente@@ d, saying that these things were so .
then paul, after that the governor had beck@@ oned unto him to speak, answered, forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, i do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
because that thou mayest under@@ st@@ and, that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship .
and they neither found me in the temple dispu@@ ting with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city :
neither can they pro@@ ve the things whereof they now accuse me .
but this i confess unto thee, that after the way which they call here@@ sy, so worship i the god of my fathers, belie@@ ving all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
and have hope toward god, which they themselves also al@@ lo@@ w, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust .
and here@@ in do i exercise myself, to have always a cons@@ ci@@ ence vo@@ id to off@@ ence toward god, and toward men .
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation, and off@@ er@@ ings .
where@@ upon certain jews from asia found me puri@@ fied in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tu@@ mul@@ t .
who ought to have been here before thee, and ob@@ je@@ c@@ t, if they had ought against me .
or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil do@@ ing in me, while i stood before the council ,
except it be for this one voice, that i cried standing among them, touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day .
and when felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he de@@ fer@@ red them, and said, when ly@@ sias the chief captain shall come down, i will know the uttermost of your matter .
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul, and to let him have liber@@ ty, and that he should forbid none of his ac@@ qua@@ int@@ ance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days, when felix came with his wife d@@ ru@@ sil@@ la@@ , which was a jew@@ es@@ s, he sent for paul, and heard him concerning the faith in christ .
and as he reasoned of righteousness, tem@@ per@@ an@@ ce, and judgment to come, felix tremb@@ led, and answered, go thy way for this time ; when i have a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent seas@@ on, i will call for thee .
he ho@@ ped also that money should have been given him of paul, that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er, and comm@@ un@@ ed with him .
but after two years por@@ ci@@ us festus came into felix ' room : and feli@@ x@@ , willing to shew the jews a ple@@ asu@@ re, left paul bound .
now when festus was come into the pro@@ vin@@ ce, after three days he as@@ cen@@ ded from caesarea to jerusalem .
then the high priest and the chief of the jews infor@@ med him against paul, and besought him ,
and desired fav@@ our against him, that he would send for him to jerusalem, la@@ ying wait in the way to kill him .
but festus answered, that paul should be kept at caesa@@ rea, and that he himself would depart shor@@ tly thither .
let them therefore, said he, which among you are ab@@ le, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wi@@ c@@ ke@@ dness in him .
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought .
and when he was come, the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grie@@ v@@ ous com@@ pla@@ ints against paul, which they could not pro@@ ve .
while he answered for himself, neither against the law of the jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against caesar, have i offended any thing at all .
but fes@@ tus, willing to do the jews a ple@@ asu@@ re, answered paul, and said, wilt thou go up to jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me ?
then said paul, i stand at caesar 's judgment se@@ at, where i ought to be judged : to the jews have i done no wr@@ on@@ g, as thou very well knowest .
for if i be an offen@@ d@@ er, or have committed any thing worthy of death, i re@@ f@@ use not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them . i appea@@ l unto caesar .
then fes@@ tus, when he had con@@ fer@@ red with the council, answered, hast thou appe@@ aled unto caesar ? unto caesar shalt thou go .
and after certain days king agri@@ ppa and ber@@ ni@@ ce came unto caesarea to salu@@ te festus .
and when they had been there many days, festus declared paul 's cause unto the king, saying, there is a certain man left in bon@@ ds by felix :
about who@@ m, when i was at jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the jews infor@@ med me, desiring to have judgment against him .
to whom i answered, it is not the manner of the roman@@ s to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accu@@ sers face to face, and have li@@ cen@@ ce to answer for himself concerning the cri@@ me laid against him .
therefore, when they were come hi@@ ther, without any de@@ lay on the morrow i sat on the judgment se@@ at, and commanded the man to be brought forth .
against whom when the accu@@ sers stood up, they brought none accu@@ sa@@ tion of such things as i suppo@@ sed :
but had certain questi@@ ons against him of their own super@@ sti@@ tion, and of one jesus, which was dead, whom paul af@@ fir@@ med to be a@@ live .
and because i doub@@ ted of such manner of questi@@ ons, i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem, and there be judged of these mat@@ ters .
but when paul had appe@@ aled to be re@@ served unto the hearing of au@@ gu@@ st@@ us, i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar .
then agri@@ ppa said unto fes@@ tus, i would also hear the man myself . to morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him .
and on the morrow, when agri@@ ppa was come, and ber@@ ni@@ ce, with great po@@ m@@ p, and was entered into the place of hear@@ ing, with the chief cap@@ tains, and prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l men of the city, at festus ' commandment paul was brought forth .
and festus said, king agri@@ ppa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the jews have de@@ al@@ t with me, both at jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any lon@@ ger .
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appe@@ aled to au@@ gu@@ st@@ us, i have determined to send him .
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord . wherefore i have brought him forth before you, and spe@@ ci@@ al@@ ly before thee, o king agri@@ ppa, that, after exa@@ min@@ ation ha@@ d, i might have some@@ what to write .
for it see@@ meth to me un@@ reas@@ on@@ able to send a prison@@ er, and not with@@ al to signi@@ fy the cri@@ mes laid against him .
then agri@@ ppa said unto paul, thou art per@@ mi@@ tted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself :
i think myself ha@@ pp@@ y, king agri@@ ppa, because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews :
es@@ pe@@ ci@@ al@@ ly because i know thee to be ex@@ per@@ t in all custo@@ ms and questi@@ ons which are among the jews : wherefore i besee@@ ch thee to hear me pa@@ ti@@ en@@ tly .
my manner of life from my you@@ th, which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem, know all the jews ;
which knew me from the begin@@ ning, if they would testi@@ f@@ y, that after the most strai@@ test se@@ ct of our re@@ li@@ gion i li@@ ved a pharisee .
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god, unto our fathers :
unto which promise our twelve tri@@ bes, in@@ stan@@ tly ser@@ ving god day and night, hope to come . for which hope 's sake, king agri@@ ppa, i am accused of the jews .
why should it be thought a thing incre@@ di@@ ble with you, that god should raise the dead ?
i verily thought with myself, that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
which thing i also did in jerusalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did i shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death, i gave my voice against them .
and i p@@ un@@ ished them of@@ t in every synagogue, and com@@ pe@@ lled them to blasphe@@ me ; and being excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly ma@@ d against them, i persecuted them even unto stran@@ ge cities .
where@@ upon as i went to damascus with authority and commi@@ s@@ sion from the chief priests ,
at mid@@ day, o king, i saw in the way a light from heaven, above the bri@@ ght@@ ness of the sun@@ , shi@@ ning round about me and them which journe@@ yed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the earth, i heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the hebre@@ w tongu@@ e, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to ki@@ ck against the pri@@ c@@ ks .
and i said, who art thou, lord ? and he said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
but rise, and stand upon thy feet : for i have appeared unto thee for this purpo@@ se, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast se@@ en, and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee ;
deli@@ ver@@ ing thee from the people, and from the gentiles, unto whom now i send thee ,
to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto god, that they may receive forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins, and inheritance among them which are sancti@@ fied by faith that is in me .
where@@ up@@ on, o king agri@@ ppa, i was not di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent unto the heavenly vision :
but shewed first unto them of damasc@@ us, and at jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of judaea, and then to the gentiles, that they should repent and turn to god, and do works meet for repentance .
for these ca@@ u@@ ses the jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me .
having therefore ob@@ ta@@ ined help of god, i continu@@ e unto this day, witnes@@ sing both to small and grea@@ t, saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come :
that christ should suf@@ f@@ er, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the gentiles .
and as he thus spake for himself, festus said with a loud voice, paul, thou art beside thyself ; much lear@@ ning doth make thee ma@@ d .
but he said, i am not ma@@ d, most no@@ ble festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and so@@ ber@@ ness .
for the king knoweth of these things, before whom also i speak fre@@ e@@ ly : for i am persuaded that none of these things are hi@@ d@@ den from him ; for this thing was not done in a cor@@ ner .
king agri@@ ppa, believest thou the prophets ? i know that thou believest .
then agri@@ ppa said unto paul, al@@ most thou persu@@ ad@@ est me to be a chri@@ sti@@ an .
and paul said, i would to god, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both al@@ mo@@ st, and al@@ together such as i am, except these bon@@ ds .
and when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the gover@@ n@@ or, and ber@@ ni@@ ce, and they that sat with them :
and when they were gone asi@@ de, they talked between themselves, saying, this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bon@@ ds .
then said agri@@ ppa unto fes@@ tus, this man might have been set at liber@@ ty, if he had not appe@@ aled unto caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail into i@@ tal@@ y, they delivered paul and certain other prison@@ ers unto one named ju@@ li@@ us, a centurion of au@@ gu@@ st@@ us ' band .
and entering into a ship of ad@@ ra@@ my@@ t@@ ti@@ u@@ m, we laun@@ che@@ d, me@@ an@@ ing to sail by the coasts of asia ; one ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us, a macedoni@@ an of thes@@ sa@@ loni@@ ca@@ , being with us .
and the next day we touched at sid@@ on . and ju@@ li@@ us cour@@ te@@ ously en@@ trea@@ ted paul, and gave him liber@@ ty to go unto his friends to re@@ fre@@ sh himself .
and when we had laun@@ ched from thence, we sailed under cyp@@ ru@@ s, because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilici@@ a and pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, we came to my@@ ra@@ , a city of ly@@ ci@@ a .
and there the centurion found a ship of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a sai@@ ling into i@@ tal@@ y ; and he put us therein .
and when we had sailed s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly many days, and s@@ car@@ ce were come over against c@@ ni@@ d@@ us, the wind not suf@@ f@@ ering us, we sailed under cre@@ te, over against sal@@ m@@ one ;
and, har@@ dly pas@@ sing it, came unto a place which is called the fa@@ ir ha@@ ven@@ s ; nigh whereunto was the city of la@@ sea .
now when much time was sp@@ ent, and when sai@@ ling was now d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous, because the fast was now already pa@@ st, paul ad@@ mon@@ ished them ,
and said unto them, sirs, i perceive that this vo@@ y@@ age will be with hu@@ r@@ t and much da@@ mag@@ e, not only of the la@@ ding and ship, but also of our li@@ ves .
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the ow@@ ner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by paul .
and because the ha@@ ven was not com@@ mo@@ di@@ ous to win@@ ter in, the more part ad@@ vi@@ sed to depart thence also, if by any means they might at@@ tain to phe@@ ni@@ ce, and there to win@@ ter ; which is an ha@@ ven of cre@@ te, and lie@@ th toward the south west and n@@ or@@ th west .
and when the south wind ble@@ w so@@ f@@ tly, sup@@ pos@@ ing that they had ob@@ ta@@ ined their purpo@@ se, loo@@ sing thence, they sailed clo@@ se by cre@@ te .
but not long after there arose against it a temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous wind, called e@@ u@@ ro@@ c@@ ly@@ d@@ on .
and when the ship was ca@@ u@@ ght, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her d@@ ri@@ ve .
and run@@ ning under a certain is@@ land which is called c@@ lau@@ da@@ , we had much work to come by the bo@@ at :
which when they had taken up, they used hel@@ p@@ s, under@@ gir@@ ding the ship ; and, fe@@ aring lest they should fall into the quick@@ s@@ and@@ s, stra@@ ke sai@@ l, and so were d@@ ri@@ ven .
and we being excee@@ d@@ ing@@ ly to@@ ssed with a temp@@ est, the next day they light@@ ened the ship ;
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the ta@@ ck@@ ling of the ship .
and when neither sun nor star@@ s in many days appea@@ red, and no small temp@@ est lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, sirs, ye should have hear@@ k@@ ened unto me, and not have loosed from cre@@ te, and to have gained this har@@ m and lo@@ ss .
and now i exhor@@ t you to be of good che@@ er : for there shall be no lo@@ ss of any man 's life among you, but of the ship .
for there stood by me this night the angel of god, whose i am, and whom i serve ,
saying, fear not, paul ; thou must be brought before caesar : and, lo, god hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
where@@ fore, sirs, be of good che@@ er : for i believe god, that it shall be even as it was told me .
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain is@@ land .
but when the four@@ te@@ en@@ th night was come, as we were d@@ ri@@ ven up and down in ad@@ ri@@ a, about mid@@ night the shi@@ p@@ men dee@@ med that they drew near to some country ;
and s@@ oun@@ ded, and found it tw@@ en@@ ty fa@@ tho@@ ms : and when they had gone a little fur@@ ther, they s@@ ounded again, and found it fif@@ teen fa@@ tho@@ ms .
then fe@@ aring lest we should have fallen upon ro@@ ck@@ s, they cast four an@@ ch@@ ors out of the ster@@ n, and wi@@ shed for the day .
and as the shi@@ p@@ men were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the bo@@ at into the sea, under co@@ l@@ our as though they would have cast an@@ ch@@ ors out of the fore@@ ship ,
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved .
then the soldiers cut off the ro@@ pes of the bo@@ at, and let her fall off .
and while the day was coming on, paul besought them all to take meat, saying, this day is the four@@ te@@ en@@ th day that ye have tarried and continued fast@@ ing, having taken nothing .
wherefore i pray you to take some meat : for this is for your heal@@ th : for there shall not an ha@@ ir fall from the head of any of you .
and when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave than@@ ks to god in presence of them all : and when he had broken it, he began to eat .
then were they all of good che@@ er, and they also took some meat .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and six@@ teen souls .
and when they had eaten en@@ ough@@ , they light@@ ened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when it was day, they knew not the land : but they dis@@ co@@ vered a certain cre@@ e@@ k with a sho@@ re, into the which they were min@@ ded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ or@@ s, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the ru@@ d@@ der b@@ and@@ s, and ho@@ ised up the ma@@ in@@ sail to the wind, and made toward shor@@ e .
and fal@@ ling into a place where two se@@ as me@@ t, they ran the ship a@@ ground ; and the fore@@ part stu@@ ck fa@@ st, and remained un@@ mo@@ ve@@ ab@@ le, but the hin@@ der part was broken with the viol@@ ence of the wa@@ ves .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prison@@ ers, lest any of them should s@@ wi@@ m out, and es@@ cap@@ e .
but the centurion, willing to save paul, kept them from their purpo@@ se ; and commanded that they which could s@@ wi@@ m should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land :
and the re@@ st, some on bo@@ ar@@ ds, and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass, that they es@@ cap@@ ed all sa@@ f@@ e to land .
and when they were es@@ ca@@ pe@@ d, then they knew that the is@@ land was called me@@ li@@ t@@ a .
and the bar@@ bar@@ ous people shewed us no little kin@@ dness : for they kind@@ led a fire, and received us every one, because of the present ra@@ in, and because of the co@@ ld .
and when paul had gathered a b@@ und@@ le of sti@@ ck@@ s, and laid them on the fire, there came a vi@@ per out of the hea@@ t, and fast@@ ened on his hand .
and when the bar@@ bar@@ i@@ ans saw the ven@@ o@@ m@@ ous bea@@ st han@@ g on his hand, they said among themselves, no doub@@ t this man is a murde@@ re@@ r, who@@ m, though he hath es@@ cap@@ ed the sea, yet ven@@ ge@@ ance suffe@@ reth not to live .
and he sho@@ ok off the bea@@ st into the fire, and fe@@ lt no har@@ m .
howbeit they looked when he should have s@@ wo@@ ll@@ en, or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while, and saw no har@@ m come to him, they chan@@ ged their min@@ ds, and said that he was a god .
in the same qu@@ ar@@ ters were posses@@ sions of the chief man of the is@@ land, whose name was publi@@ us ; who received us, and lodged us three days cour@@ te@@ ously .
and it came to pass, that the father of publi@@ us lay sick of a fever and of a bloo@@ dy f@@ lu@@ x : to whom paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him .
so when this was done, others also, which had disea@@ ses in the is@@ land, came, and were healed :
who also honou@@ red us with many hon@@ ours ; and when we departed, they la@@ ded us with such things as were ne@@ c@@ es@@ sa@@ ry .
and after three month@@ s we departed in a ship of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a, which had win@@ tered in the is@@ le, whose sign was cast@@ or and pol@@ lu@@ x .
and lan@@ ding at sy@@ ra@@ cu@@ se, we tarried there three days .
and from thence we fe@@ t@@ ched a com@@ pass, and came to r@@ he@@ gi@@ u@@ m : and after one day the south wind ble@@ w, and we came the next day to pu@@ te@@ o@@ l@@ i :
where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward ro@@ me .
and from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as ap@@ pi@@ i for@@ u@@ m, and the three ta@@ ver@@ ns : whom when paul sa@@ w, he than@@ ked god, and took c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge .
and when we came to ro@@ me, the centurion delivered the prison@@ ers to the captain of the gu@@ ard : but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldi@@ er that kept him .
and it came to pass, that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together : and when they were come together, he said unto them, men and brethren, though i have committed nothing against the people, or custo@@ ms of our fathers, yet was i delivered prison@@ er from jerusalem into the hands of the roman@@ s .
who, when they had exa@@ mined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me .
but when the jews spake against it, i was con@@ strained to appea@@ l unto caesar ; not that i had ought to accuse my nation of .
for this cause therefore have i called for you, to see you, and to speak with you : because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this cha@@ in .
and they said unto him, we neither received le@@ tters out of judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any har@@ m of thee .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thin@@ kest : for as concerning this se@@ c@@ t, we know that every where it is spoken against .
and when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lod@@ ging ; to whom he ex@@ p@@ ounded and testi@@ fied the kingdom of god, persua@@ ding them concerning jesus, both out of the law of moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till even@@ ing .
and some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not .
and when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that paul had spoken one word, well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
saying, go unto this people, and say, hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive :
for the heart of this people is waxed g@@ ro@@ ss, and their ears are du@@ ll of hear@@ ing, and their eyes have they clo@@ sed ; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and i should heal them .
be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles, and that they will hear it .
and when he had said these words, the jews departed, and had great reas@@ oning among themselves .
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him ,
preaching the kingdom of god, and teaching those things which concer@@ n the lord jesus christ, with all con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce, no man for@@ bid@@ ding him .
