[ eng.1 ] in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god , and the word was god .
[ eng.2 ] the same was in the beginning with god .
[ eng.3 ] all things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
[ eng.4 ] in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
[ eng.5 ] and the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
[ eng.6 ] there was a man sent from god , whose name was john .
[ eng.7 ] the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the light , that all men through him might believe .
[ eng.8 ] he was not that light , but was sent to bear witness of that light .
[ eng.9 ] that was the true light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
[ eng.10 ] he was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
[ eng.11 ] he came unto his own , and his own received him not .
[ eng.12 ] but as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name :
[ eng.13 ] which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .
[ eng.14 ] and the word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the father , ) full of grace and truth .
[ eng.15 ] john bare witness of him , and cried , saying , this was he of whom i spake , he that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
[ eng.16 ] and of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
[ eng.17 ] for the law was given by moses , but grace and truth came by jesus christ .
[ eng.18 ] no man hath seen god at any time , the only begotten son , which is in the bosom of the father , he hath declared him .
[ eng.19 ] and this is the record of john , when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him , who art thou ?
[ eng.20 ] and he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , i am not the christ .
[ eng.21 ] and they asked him , what then ? art thou elias ? and he saith , i am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered , no .
[ eng.22 ] then said they unto him , who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
[ eng.23 ] he said , i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , make straight the way of the lord , as said the prophet esaias .
[ eng.24 ] and they which were sent were of the pharisees .
[ eng.25 ] and they asked him , and said unto him , why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that christ , nor elias , neither that prophet ?
[ eng.26 ] john answered them , saying , i baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
[ eng.27 ] he it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe 's latchet i am not worthy to unloose .
[ eng.28 ] these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan , where john was baptizing .
[ eng.29 ] the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold the lamb of god , which taketh away the sin of the world .
[ eng.30 ] this is he of whom i said , after me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
[ eng.31 ] and i knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to israel , therefore am i come baptizing with water .
[ eng.32 ] and john bare record , saying , i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
[ eng.33 ] and i knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost .
[ eng.34 ] and i saw , and bare record that this is the son of god .
[ eng.35 ] again the next day after john stood , and two of his disciples ;
[ eng.36 ] and looking upon jesus as he walked , he saith , behold the lamb of god !
[ eng.37 ] and the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed jesus .
[ eng.38 ] then jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , what seek ye ? they said unto him , rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , master , ) where dwellest thou ?
[ eng.39 ] he saith unto them , come and see . they came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
[ eng.40 ] one of the two which heard john speak , and followed him , was andrew , simon peter 's brother .
[ eng.41 ] he first findeth his own brother simon , and saith unto him , we have found the messias , which is , being interpreted , the christ .
[ eng.42 ] and he brought him to jesus . and when jesus beheld him , he said , thou art simon the son of jona : thou shalt be called cephas , which is by interpretation , a stone .
[ eng.43 ] the day following jesus would go forth into galilee , and findeth philip , and saith unto him , follow me .
[ eng.44 ] now philip was of bethsaida , the city of andrew and peter .
[ eng.45 ] philip findeth nathanael , and saith unto him , we have found him , of whom moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , jesus of nazareth , the son of joseph .
[ eng.46 ] and nathanael said unto him , can there any good thing come out of nazareth ? philip saith unto him , come and see .
[ eng.47 ] jesus saw nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , behold an israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
[ eng.48 ] nathanael saith unto him , whence knowest thou me ? jesus answered and said unto him , before that philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , i saw thee .
[ eng.49 ] nathanael answered and saith unto him , rabbi , thou art the son of god ; thou art the king of israel .
[ eng.50 ] jesus answered and said unto him , because i said unto thee , i saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
[ eng.51 ] and he saith unto him , verily , verily , i say unto you , hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man .
[ eng.1 ] and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee ; and the mother of jesus was there :
[ eng.2 ] and both jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
[ eng.3 ] and when they wanted wine , the mother of jesus saith unto him , they have no wine .
[ eng.4 ] jesus saith unto her , woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
[ eng.5 ] his mother saith unto the servants , whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
[ eng.6 ] and there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
[ eng.7 ] jesus saith unto them , fill the waterpots with water . and they filled them up to the brim .
[ eng.8 ] and he saith unto them , draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . and they bare it .
[ eng.9 ] when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
[ eng.10 ] and saith unto him , every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
[ eng.11 ] this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
[ eng.12 ] after this he went down to capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
[ eng.13 ] and the jews ' passover was at hand , and jesus went up to jerusalem .
[ eng.14 ] and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
[ eng.15 ] and when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
[ eng.16 ] and said unto them that sold doves , take these things hence ; make not my father 's house an house of merchandise .
[ eng.17 ] and his disciples remembered that it was written , the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
[ eng.18 ] then answered the jews and said unto him , what sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
[ eng.19 ] jesus answered and said unto them , destroy this temple , and in three days i will raise it up .
[ eng.20 ] then said the jews , forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
[ eng.21 ] but he spake of the temple of his body .
[ eng.22 ] when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which jesus had said .
[ eng.23 ] now when he was in jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
[ eng.24 ] but jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
[ eng.25 ] and needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
[ eng.1 ] there was a man of the pharisees , named nicodemus , a ruler of the jews :
[ eng.2 ] the same came to jesus by night , and said unto him , rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from god : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except god be with him .
[ eng.3 ] jesus answered and said unto him , verily , verily , i say unto thee , except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god .
[ eng.4 ] nicodemus saith unto him , how can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
[ eng.5 ] jesus answered , verily , verily , i say unto thee , except a man be born of water and of the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .
[ eng.6 ] that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .
[ eng.7 ] marvel not that i said unto thee , ye must be born again .
[ eng.8 ] the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the spirit .
[ eng.9 ] nicodemus answered and said unto him , how can these things be ?
[ eng.10 ] jesus answered and said unto him , art thou a master of israel , and knowest not these things ?
[ eng.11 ] verily , verily , i say unto thee , we speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
[ eng.12 ] if i have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if i tell you of heavenly things ?
[ eng.13 ] and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the son of man which is in heaven .
[ eng.14 ] and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the son of man be lifted up :
[ eng.15 ] that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
[ eng.16 ] for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
[ eng.17 ] for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
[ eng.18 ] he that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god .
[ eng.19 ] and this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
[ eng.20 ] for every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
[ eng.21 ] but he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in god .
[ eng.22 ] after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
[ eng.23 ] and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
[ eng.24 ] for john was not yet cast into prison .
[ eng.25 ] then there arose a question between some of john 's disciples and the jews about purifying .
[ eng.26 ] and they came unto john , and said unto him , rabbi , he that was with thee beyond jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
[ eng.27 ] john answered and said , a man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
[ eng.28 ] ye yourselves bear me witness , that i said , i am not the christ , but that i am sent before him .
[ eng.29 ] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
[ eng.30 ] he must increase , but i must decrease .
[ eng.31 ] he that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
[ eng.32 ] and what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
[ eng.33 ] he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true .
[ eng.34 ] for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god : for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him .
[ eng.35 ] the father loveth the son , and hath given all things into his hand .
[ eng.36 ] he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the son shall not see life ; but the wrath of god abideth on him .
[ eng.1 ] when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john ,
[ eng.2 ] ( though jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
[ eng.3 ] he left judaea , and departed again into galilee .
[ eng.4 ] and he must needs go through samaria .
[ eng.5 ] then cometh he to a city of samaria , which is called sychar , near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph .
[ eng.6 ] now jacob 's well was there . jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
[ eng.7 ] there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water : jesus saith unto her , give me to drink .
[ eng.8 ] ( for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
[ eng.9 ] then saith the woman of samaria unto him , how is it that thou , being a jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of samaria ? for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans .
[ eng.10 ] jesus answered and said unto her , if thou knewest the gift of god , and who it is that saith to thee , give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
[ eng.11 ] the woman saith unto him , sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
[ eng.12 ] art thou greater than our father jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
[ eng.13 ] jesus answered and said unto her , whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
[ eng.14 ] but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
[ eng.15 ] the woman saith unto him , sir , give me this water , that i thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
[ eng.16 ] jesus saith unto her , go , call thy husband , and come hither .
[ eng.17 ] the woman answered and said , i have no husband . jesus said unto her , thou hast well said , i have no husband :
[ eng.18 ] for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
[ eng.19 ] the woman saith unto him , sir , i perceive that thou art a prophet .
[ eng.20 ] our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
[ eng.21 ] jesus saith unto her , woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at jerusalem , worship the father .
[ eng.22 ] ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the jews .
[ eng.23 ] but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth : for the father seeketh such to worship him .
[ eng.24 ] god is a spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
[ eng.25 ] the woman saith unto him , i know that messias cometh , which is called christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
[ eng.26 ] jesus saith unto her , i that speak unto thee am he .
[ eng.27 ] and upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , what seekest thou ? or , why talkest thou with her ?
[ eng.28 ] the woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
[ eng.29 ] come , see a man , which told me all things that ever i did : is not this the christ ?
[ eng.30 ] then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
[ eng.31 ] in the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , master , eat .
[ eng.32 ] but he said unto them , i have meat to eat that ye know not of .
[ eng.33 ] therefore said the disciples one to another , hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
[ eng.34 ] jesus saith unto them , my meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
[ eng.35 ] say not ye , there are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , i say unto you , lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
[ eng.36 ] and he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
[ eng.37 ] and herein is that saying true , one soweth , and another reapeth .
[ eng.38 ] i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
[ eng.39 ] and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , he told me all that ever i did .
[ eng.40 ] so when the samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
[ eng.41 ] and many more believed because of his own word ;
[ eng.42 ] and said unto the woman , now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the christ , the saviour of the world .
[ eng.43 ] now after two days he departed thence , and went into galilee .
[ eng.44 ] for jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
[ eng.45 ] then when he was come into galilee , the galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
[ eng.46 ] so jesus came again into cana of galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at capernaum .
[ eng.47 ] when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
[ eng.48 ] then said jesus unto him , except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
[ eng.49 ] the nobleman saith unto him , sir , come down ere my child die .
[ eng.50 ] jesus saith unto him , go thy way ; thy son liveth . and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
[ eng.51 ] and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , thy son liveth .
[ eng.52 ] then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said unto him , yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
[ eng.53 ] so the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which jesus said unto him , thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
[ eng.54 ] this is again the second miracle that jesus did , when he was come out of judaea into galilee .
[ eng.1 ] after this there was a feast of the jews ; and jesus went up to jerusalem .
[ eng.2 ] now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda , having five porches .
[ eng.3 ] in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
[ eng.4 ] for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
[ eng.5 ] and a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
[ eng.6 ] when jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , wilt thou be made whole ?
[ eng.7 ] the impotent man answered him , sir , i have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while i am coming , another steppeth down before me .
[ eng.8 ] jesus saith unto him , rise , take up thy bed , and walk .
[ eng.9 ] and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
[ eng.10 ] the jews therefore said unto him that was cured , it is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
[ eng.11 ] he answered them , he that made me whole , the same said unto me , take up thy bed , and walk .
[ eng.12 ] then asked they him , what man is that which said unto thee , take up thy bed , and walk ?
[ eng.13 ] and he that was healed wist not who it was : for jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
[ eng.14 ] afterward jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
[ eng.15 ] the man departed , and told the jews that it was jesus , which had made him whole .
[ eng.16 ] and therefore did the jews persecute jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
[ eng.17 ] but jesus answered them , my father worketh hitherto , and i work .
[ eng.18 ] therefore the jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that god was his father , making himself equal with god .
[ eng.19 ] then answered jesus and said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , the son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the son likewise .
[ eng.20 ] for the father loveth the son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
[ eng.21 ] for as the father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the son quickeneth whom he will .
[ eng.22 ] for the father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the son :
[ eng.23 ] that all men should honour the son , even as they honour the father . he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him .
[ eng.24 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , he that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
[ eng.25 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , the hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god : and they that hear shall live .
[ eng.26 ] for as the father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the son to have life in himself ;
[ eng.27 ] and hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the son of man .
[ eng.28 ] marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
[ eng.29 ] and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
[ eng.30 ] i can of mine own self do nothing : as i hear , i judge : and my judgment is just ; because i seek not mine own will , but the will of the father which hath sent me .
[ eng.31 ] if i bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
[ eng.32 ] there is another that beareth witness of me ; and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
[ eng.33 ] ye sent unto john , and he bare witness unto the truth .
[ eng.34 ] but i receive not testimony from man : but these things i say , that ye might be saved .
[ eng.35 ] he was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
[ eng.36 ] but i have greater witness than that of john : for the works which the father hath given me to finish , the same works that i do , bear witness of me , that the father hath sent me .
[ eng.37 ] and the father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
[ eng.38 ] and ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
[ eng.39 ] search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
[ eng.40 ] and ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
[ eng.41 ] i receive not honour from men .
[ eng.42 ] but i know you , that ye have not the love of god in you .
[ eng.43 ] i am come in my father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
[ eng.44 ] how can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from god only ?
[ eng.45 ] do not think that i will accuse you to the father : there is one that accuseth you , even moses , in whom ye trust .
[ eng.46 ] for had ye believed moses , ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of me .
[ eng.47 ] but if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
[ eng.1 ] after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee , which is the sea of tiberias .
[ eng.2 ] and a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
[ eng.3 ] and jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
[ eng.4 ] and the passover , a feast of the jews , was nigh .
[ eng.5 ] when jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto philip , whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
[ eng.6 ] and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
[ eng.7 ] philip answered him , two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
[ eng.8 ] one of his disciples , andrew , simon peter 's brother , saith unto him ,
[ eng.9 ] there is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
[ eng.10 ] and jesus said , make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
[ eng.11 ] and jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
[ eng.12 ] when they were filled , he said unto his disciples , gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
[ eng.13 ] therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
[ eng.14 ] then those men , when they had seen the miracle that jesus did , said , this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
[ eng.15 ] when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
[ eng.16 ] and when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
[ eng.17 ] and entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward capernaum . and it was now dark , and jesus was not come to them .
[ eng.18 ] and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
[ eng.19 ] so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
[ eng.20 ] but he saith unto them , it is i ; be not afraid .
[ eng.21 ] then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
[ eng.22 ] the day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
[ eng.23 ] ( howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the lord had given thanks : )
[ eng.24 ] when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to capernaum , seeking for jesus .
[ eng.25 ] and when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
[ eng.26 ] jesus answered them and said , verily , verily , i say unto you , ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
[ eng.27 ] labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the son of man shall give unto you : for him hath god the father sealed .
[ eng.28 ] then said they unto him , what shall we do , that we might work the works of god ?
[ eng.29 ] jesus answered and said unto them , this is the work of god , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
[ eng.30 ] they said therefore unto him , what sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
[ eng.31 ] our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , he gave them bread from heaven to eat .
[ eng.32 ] then jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
[ eng.33 ] for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
[ eng.34 ] then said they unto him , lord , evermore give us this bread .
[ eng.35 ] and jesus said unto them , i am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
[ eng.36 ] but i said unto you , that ye also have seen me , and believe not .
[ eng.37 ] all that the father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out .
[ eng.38 ] for i came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
[ eng.39 ] and this is the father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
[ eng.40 ] and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and i will raise him up at the last day .
[ eng.41 ] the jews then murmured at him , because he said , i am the bread which came down from heaven .
[ eng.42 ] and they said , is not this jesus , the son of joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , i came down from heaven ?
[ eng.43 ] jesus therefore answered and said unto them , murmur not among yourselves .
[ eng.44 ] no man can come to me , except the father which hath sent me draw him : and i will raise him up at the last day .
[ eng.45 ] it is written in the prophets , and they shall be all taught of god . every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the father , cometh unto me .
[ eng.46 ] not that any man hath seen the father , save he which is of god , he hath seen the father .
[ eng.47 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
[ eng.48 ] i am that bread of life .
[ eng.49 ] your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
[ eng.50 ] this is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
[ eng.51 ] i am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that i will give is my flesh , which i will give for the life of the world .
[ eng.52 ] the jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , how can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
[ eng.53 ] then jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , except ye eat the flesh of the son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
[ eng.54 ] whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and i will raise him up at the last day .
[ eng.55 ] for my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
[ eng.56 ] he that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and i in him .
[ eng.57 ] as the living father hath sent me , and i live by the father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
[ eng.58 ] this is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
[ eng.59 ] these things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in capernaum .
[ eng.60 ] many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , this is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
[ eng.61 ] when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , doth this offend you ?
[ eng.62 ] what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before ?
[ eng.63 ] it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that i speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
[ eng.64 ] but there are some of you that believe not . for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
[ eng.65 ] and he said , therefore said i unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my father .
[ eng.66 ] from that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
[ eng.67 ] then said jesus unto the twelve , will ye also go away ?
[ eng.68 ] then simon peter answered him , lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
[ eng.69 ] and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ , the son of the living god .
[ eng.70 ] jesus answered them , have not i chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
[ eng.71 ] he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
[ eng.1 ] after these things jesus walked in galilee : for he would not walk in jewry , because the jews sought to kill him .
[ eng.2 ] now the jew 's feast of tabernacles was at hand .
[ eng.3 ] his brethren therefore said unto him , depart hence , and go into judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
[ eng.4 ] for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
[ eng.5 ] for neither did his brethren believe in him .
[ eng.6 ] then jesus said unto them , my time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
[ eng.7 ] the world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because i testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
[ eng.8 ] go ye up unto this feast : i go not up yet unto this feast : for my time is not yet full come .
[ eng.9 ] when he had said these words unto them , he abode still in galilee .
[ eng.10 ] but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
[ eng.11 ] then the jews sought him at the feast , and said , where is he ?
[ eng.12 ] and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , he is a good man : others said , nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
[ eng.13 ] howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews .
[ eng.14 ] now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
[ eng.15 ] and the jews marvelled , saying , how knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
[ eng.16 ] jesus answered them , and said , my doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
[ eng.17 ] if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself .
[ eng.18 ] he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
[ eng.19 ] did not moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? why go ye about to kill me ?
[ eng.20 ] the people answered and said , thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
[ eng.21 ] jesus answered and said unto them , i have done one work , and ye all marvel .
[ eng.22 ] moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
[ eng.23 ] if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
[ eng.24 ] judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
[ eng.25 ] then said some of them of jerusalem , is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
[ eng.26 ] but , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ ?
[ eng.27 ] howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
[ eng.28 ] then cried jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , ye both know me , and ye know whence i am : and i am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
[ eng.29 ] but i know him : for i am from him , and he hath sent me .
[ eng.30 ] then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
[ eng.31 ] and many of the people believed on him , and said , when christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
[ eng.32 ] the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
[ eng.33 ] then said jesus unto them , yet a little while am i with you , and then i go unto him that sent me .
[ eng.34 ] ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , thither ye cannot come .
[ eng.35 ] then said the jews among themselves , whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles , and teach the gentiles ?
[ eng.36 ] what manner of saying is this that he said , ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , thither ye cannot come ?
[ eng.37 ] in the last day , that great day of the feast , jesus stood and cried , saying , if any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
[ eng.38 ] he that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
[ eng.39 ] ( but this spake he of the spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the holy ghost was not yet given ; because that jesus was not yet glorified . )
[ eng.40 ] many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , of a truth this is the prophet .
[ eng.41 ] others said , this is the christ . but some said , shall christ come out of galilee ?
[ eng.42 ] hath not the scripture said , that christ cometh of the seed of david , and out of the town of bethlehem , where david was ?
[ eng.43 ] so there was a division among the people because of him .
[ eng.44 ] and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
[ eng.45 ] then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees ; and they said unto them , why have ye not brought him ?
[ eng.46 ] the officers answered , never man spake like this man .
[ eng.47 ] then answered them the pharisees , are ye also deceived ?
[ eng.48 ] have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him ?
[ eng.49 ] but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
[ eng.50 ] nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to jesus by night , being one of them , )
[ eng.51 ] doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
[ eng.52 ] they answered and said unto him , art thou also of galilee ? search , and look : for out of galilee ariseth no prophet .
[ eng.53 ] and every man went unto his own house .
[ eng.1 ] jesus went unto the mount of olives .
[ eng.2 ] and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
[ eng.3 ] and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
[ eng.4 ] they say unto him , master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
[ eng.5 ] now moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
[ eng.6 ] this they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . but jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
[ eng.7 ] so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , he that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
[ eng.8 ] and again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
[ eng.9 ] and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
[ eng.10 ] when jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
[ eng.11 ] she said , no man , lord . and jesus said unto her , neither do i condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
[ eng.12 ] then spake jesus again unto them , saying , i am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
[ eng.13 ] the pharisees therefore said unto him , thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
[ eng.14 ] jesus answered and said unto them , though i bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for i know whence i came , and whither i go ; but ye cannot tell whence i come , and whither i go .
[ eng.15 ] ye judge after the flesh ; i judge no man .
[ eng.16 ] and yet if i judge , my judgment is true : for i am not alone , but i and the father that sent me .
[ eng.17 ] it is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
[ eng.18 ] i am one that bear witness of myself , and the father that sent me beareth witness of me .
[ eng.19 ] then said they unto him , where is thy father ? jesus answered , ye neither know me , nor my father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my father also .
[ eng.20 ] these words spake jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
[ eng.21 ] then said jesus again unto them , i go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither i go , ye cannot come .
[ eng.22 ] then said the jews , will he kill himself ? because he saith , whither i go , ye cannot come .
[ eng.23 ] and he said unto them , ye are from beneath ; i am from above : ye are of this world ; i am not of this world .
[ eng.24 ] i said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that i am he , ye shall die in your sins .
[ eng.25 ] then said they unto him , who art thou ? and jesus saith unto them , even the same that i said unto you from the beginning .
[ eng.26 ] i have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him .
[ eng.27 ] they understood not that he spake to them of the father .
[ eng.28 ] then said jesus unto them , when ye have lifted up the son of man , then shall ye know that i am he , and that i do nothing of myself ; but as my father hath taught me , i speak these things .
[ eng.29 ] and he that sent me is with me : the father hath not left me alone ; for i do always those things that please him .
[ eng.30 ] as he spake these words , many believed on him .
[ eng.31 ] then said jesus to those jews which believed on him , if ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
[ eng.32 ] and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
[ eng.33 ] they answered him , we be abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , ye shall be made free ?
[ eng.34 ] jesus answered them , verily , verily , i say unto you , whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
[ eng.35 ] and the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the son abideth ever .
[ eng.36 ] if the son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
[ eng.37 ] i know that ye are abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
[ eng.38 ] i speak that which i have seen with my father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
[ eng.39 ] they answered and said unto him , abraham is our father . jesus saith unto them , if ye were abraham 's children , ye would do the works of abraham .
[ eng.40 ] but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which i have heard of god : this did not abraham .
[ eng.41 ] ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him , we be not born of fornication ; we have one father , even god .
[ eng.42 ] jesus said unto them , if god were your father , ye would love me : for i proceeded forth and came from god ; neither came i of myself , but he sent me .
[ eng.43 ] why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
[ eng.44 ] ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . he was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . when he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
[ eng.45 ] and because i tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
[ eng.46 ] which of you convinceth me of sin ? and if i say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
[ eng.47 ] he that is of god heareth god 's words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of god .
[ eng.48 ] then answered the jews , and said unto him , say we not well that thou art a samaritan , and hast a devil ?
[ eng.49 ] jesus answered , i have not a devil ; but i honour my father , and ye do dishonour me .
[ eng.50 ] and i seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
[ eng.51 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , if a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
[ eng.52 ] then said the jews unto him , now we know that thou hast a devil . abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , if a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
[ eng.53 ] art thou greater than our father abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
[ eng.54 ] jesus answered , if i honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your god :
[ eng.55 ] yet ye have not known him ; but i know him : and if i should say , i know him not , i shall be a liar like unto you : but i know him , and keep his saying .
[ eng.56 ] your father abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
[ eng.57 ] then said the jews unto him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen abraham ?
[ eng.58 ] jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , before abraham was , i am .
[ eng.59 ] then took they up stones to cast at him : but jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
[ eng.1 ] and as jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
[ eng.2 ] and his disciples asked him , saying , master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
[ eng.3 ] jesus answered , neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of god should be made manifest in him .
[ eng.4 ] i must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
[ eng.5 ] as long as i am in the world , i am the light of the world .
[ eng.6 ] when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
[ eng.7 ] and said unto him , go , wash in the pool of siloam , ( which is by interpretation , sent . ) he went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
[ eng.8 ] the neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , is not this he that sat and begged ?
[ eng.9 ] some said , this is he : others said , he is like him : but he said , i am he .
[ eng.10 ] therefore said they unto him , how were thine eyes opened ?
[ eng.11 ] he answered and said , a man that is called jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , go to the pool of siloam , and wash : and i went and washed , and i received sight .
[ eng.12 ] then said they unto him , where is he ? he said , i know not .
[ eng.13 ] they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
[ eng.14 ] and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
[ eng.15 ] then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , he put clay upon mine eyes , and i washed , and do see .
[ eng.16 ] therefore said some of the pharisees , this man is not of god , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . others said , how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? and there was a division among them .
[ eng.17 ] they say unto the blind man again , what sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? he said , he is a prophet .
[ eng.18 ] but the jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
[ eng.19 ] and they asked them , saying , is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
[ eng.20 ] his parents answered them and said , we know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
[ eng.21 ] but by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
[ eng.22 ] these words spake his parents , because they feared the jews : for the jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
[ eng.23 ] therefore said his parents , he is of age ; ask him .
[ eng.24 ] then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , give god the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
[ eng.25 ] he answered and said , whether he be a sinner or no , i know not : one thing i know , that , whereas i was blind , now i see .
[ eng.26 ] then said they to him again , what did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
[ eng.27 ] he answered them , i have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
[ eng.28 ] then they reviled him , and said , thou art his disciple ; but we are moses ' disciples .
[ eng.29 ] we know that god spake unto moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
[ eng.30 ] the man answered and said unto them , why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
[ eng.31 ] now we know that god heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of god , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
[ eng.32 ] since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
[ eng.33 ] if this man were not of god , he could do nothing .
[ eng.34 ] they answered and said unto him , thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out .
[ eng.35 ] jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , dost thou believe on the son of god ?
[ eng.36 ] he answered and said , who is he , lord , that i might believe on him ?
[ eng.37 ] and jesus said unto him , thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
[ eng.38 ] and he said , lord , i believe . and he worshipped him .
[ eng.39 ] and jesus said , for judgment i am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
[ eng.40 ] and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , are we blind also ?
[ eng.41 ] jesus said unto them , if ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , we see ; therefore your sin remaineth .
[ eng.1 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
[ eng.2 ] but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
[ eng.3 ] to him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
[ eng.4 ] and when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
[ eng.5 ] and a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
[ eng.6 ] this parable spake jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
[ eng.7 ] then said jesus unto them again , verily , verily , i say unto you , i am the door of the sheep .
[ eng.8 ] all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
[ eng.9 ] i am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
[ eng.10 ] the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : i am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
[ eng.11 ] i am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
[ eng.12 ] but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
[ eng.13 ] the hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
[ eng.14 ] i am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
[ eng.15 ] as the father knoweth me , even so know i the father : and i lay down my life for the sheep .
[ eng.16 ] and other sheep i have , which are not of this fold : them also i must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
[ eng.17 ] therefore doth my father love me , because i lay down my life , that i might take it again .
[ eng.18 ] no man taketh it from me , but i lay it down of myself . i have power to lay it down , and i have power to take it again . this commandment have i received of my father .
[ eng.19 ] there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings .
[ eng.20 ] and many of them said , he hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
[ eng.21 ] others said , these are not the words of him that hath a devil . can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
[ eng.22 ] and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
[ eng.23 ] and jesus walked in the temple in solomon 's porch .
[ eng.24 ] then came the jews round about him , and said unto him , how long dost thou make us to doubt ? if thou be the christ , tell us plainly .
[ eng.25 ] jesus answered them , i told you , and ye believed not : the works that i do in my father 's name , they bear witness of me .
[ eng.26 ] but ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as i said unto you .
[ eng.27 ] my sheep hear my voice , and i know them , and they follow me :
[ eng.28 ] and i give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
[ eng.29 ] my father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my father 's hand .
[ eng.30 ] i and my father are one .
[ eng.31 ] then the jews took up stones again to stone him .
[ eng.32 ] jesus answered them , many good works have i shewed you from my father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
[ eng.33 ] the jews answered him , saying , for a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself god .
[ eng.34 ] jesus answered them , is it not written in your law , i said , ye are gods ?
[ eng.35 ] if he called them gods , unto whom the word of god came , and the scripture cannot be broken ;
[ eng.36 ] say ye of him , whom the father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , thou blasphemest ; because i said , i am the son of god ?
[ eng.37 ] if i do not the works of my father , believe me not .
[ eng.38 ] but if i do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the father is in me , and i in him .
[ eng.39 ] therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
[ eng.40 ] and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized ; and there he abode .
[ eng.41 ] and many resorted unto him , and said , john did no miracle : but all things that john spake of this man were true .
[ eng.42 ] and many believed on him there .
[ eng.1 ] now a certain man was sick , named lazarus , of bethany , the town of mary and her sister martha .
[ eng.2 ] ( it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother lazarus was sick . )
[ eng.3 ] therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
[ eng.4 ] when jesus heard that , he said , this sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of god , that the son of god might be glorified thereby .
[ eng.5 ] now jesus loved martha , and her sister , and lazarus .
[ eng.6 ] when he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
[ eng.7 ] then after that saith he to his disciples , let us go into judaea again .
[ eng.8 ] his disciples say unto him , master , the jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
[ eng.9 ] jesus answered , are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
[ eng.10 ] but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
[ eng.11 ] these things said he : and after that he saith unto them , our friend lazarus sleepeth ; but i go , that i may awake him out of sleep .
[ eng.12 ] then said his disciples , lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
[ eng.13 ] howbeit jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
[ eng.14 ] then said jesus unto them plainly , lazarus is dead .
[ eng.15 ] and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
[ eng.16 ] then said thomas , which is called didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , let us also go , that we may die with him .
[ eng.17 ] then when jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
[ eng.18 ] now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
[ eng.19 ] and many of the jews came to martha and mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
[ eng.20 ] then martha , as soon as she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary sat still in the house .
[ eng.21 ] then said martha unto jesus , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
[ eng.22 ] but i know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of god , god will give it thee .
[ eng.23 ] jesus saith unto her , thy brother shall rise again .
[ eng.24 ] martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
[ eng.25 ] jesus said unto her , i am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
[ eng.26 ] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . believest thou this ?
[ eng.27 ] she saith unto him , yea , lord : i believe that thou art the christ , the son of god , which should come into the world .
[ eng.28 ] and when she had so said , she went her way , and called mary her sister secretly , saying , the master is come , and calleth for thee .
[ eng.29 ] as soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
[ eng.30 ] now jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where martha met him .
[ eng.31 ] the jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , she goeth unto the grave to weep there .
[ eng.32 ] then when mary was come where jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
[ eng.33 ] when jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled .
[ eng.34 ] and said , where have ye laid him ? they said unto him , lord , come and see .
[ eng.35 ] jesus wept .
[ eng.36 ] then said the jews , behold how he loved him !
[ eng.37 ] and some of them said , could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
[ eng.38 ] jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
[ eng.39 ] jesus said , take ye away the stone . martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
[ eng.40 ] jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
[ eng.41 ] then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou hast heard me .
[ eng.42 ] and i knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by i said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
[ eng.43 ] and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth .
[ eng.44 ] and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . jesus saith unto them , loose him , and let him go .
[ eng.45 ] then many of the jews which came to mary , and had seen the things which jesus did , believed on him .
[ eng.46 ] but some of them went their ways to the pharisees , and told them what things jesus had done .
[ eng.47 ] then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council , and said , what do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
[ eng.48 ] if we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation .
[ eng.49 ] and one of them , named caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , ye know nothing at all ,
[ eng.50 ] nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
[ eng.51 ] and this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation ;
[ eng.52 ] and not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad .
[ eng.53 ] then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
[ eng.54 ] jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
[ eng.55 ] and the jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
[ eng.56 ] then sought they for jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , what think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
[ eng.57 ] now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
[ eng.1 ] then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany , where lazarus was , which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
[ eng.2 ] there they made him a supper ; and martha served : but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
[ eng.3 ] then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
[ eng.4 ] then saith one of his disciples , judas iscariot , simon 's son , which should betray him ,
[ eng.5 ] why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
[ eng.6 ] this he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
[ eng.7 ] then said jesus , let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
[ eng.8 ] for the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
[ eng.9 ] much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for jesus ' sake only , but that they might see lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
[ eng.10 ] but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death ;
[ eng.11 ] because that by reason of him many of the jews went away , and believed on jesus .
[ eng.12 ] on the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem ,
[ eng.13 ] took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , hosanna : blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord .
[ eng.14 ] and jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
[ eng.15 ] fear not , daughter of sion : behold , thy king cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt .
[ eng.16 ] these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
[ eng.17 ] the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
[ eng.18 ] for this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
[ eng.19 ] the pharisees therefore said among themselves , perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
[ eng.20 ] and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
[ eng.21 ] the same came therefore to philip , which was of bethsaida of galilee , and desired him , saying , sir , we would see jesus .
[ eng.22 ] philip cometh and telleth andrew : and again andrew and philip tell jesus .
[ eng.23 ] and jesus answered them , saying , the hour is come , that the son of man should be glorified .
[ eng.24 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
[ eng.25 ] he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
[ eng.26 ] if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where i am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my father honour .
[ eng.27 ] now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came i unto this hour .
[ eng.28 ] father , glorify thy name . then came there a voice from heaven , saying , i have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
[ eng.29 ] the people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , an angel spake to him .
[ eng.30 ] jesus answered and said , this voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
[ eng.31 ] now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
[ eng.32 ] and i , if i be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
[ eng.33 ] this he said , signifying what death he should die .
[ eng.34 ] the people answered him , we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , the son of man must be lifted up ? who is this son of man ?
[ eng.35 ] then jesus said unto them , yet a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
[ eng.36 ] while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
[ eng.37 ] but though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
[ eng.38 ] that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed ?
[ eng.39 ] therefore they could not believe , because that esaias said again ,
[ eng.40 ] he hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and i should heal them .
[ eng.41 ] these things said esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
[ eng.42 ] nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
[ eng.43 ] for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god .
[ eng.44 ] jesus cried and said , he that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
[ eng.45 ] and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
[ eng.46 ] i am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
[ eng.47 ] and if any man hear my words , and believe not , i judge him not : for i came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
[ eng.48 ] he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that i have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
[ eng.49 ] for i have not spoken of myself ; but the father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what i should say , and what i should speak .
[ eng.50 ] and i know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever i speak therefore , even as the father said unto me , so i speak .
[ eng.1 ] now before the feast of the passover , when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
[ eng.2 ] and supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot , simon 's son , to betray him ;
[ eng.3 ] jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from god , and went to god ;
[ eng.4 ] he riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
[ eng.5 ] after that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
[ eng.6 ] then cometh he to simon peter : and peter saith unto him , lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
[ eng.7 ] jesus answered and said unto him , what i do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
[ eng.8 ] peter saith unto him , thou shalt never wash my feet . jesus answered him , if i wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
[ eng.9 ] simon peter saith unto him , lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
[ eng.10 ] jesus saith to him , he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
[ eng.11 ] for he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , ye are not all clean .
[ eng.12 ] so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , know ye what i have done to you ?
[ eng.13 ] ye call me master and lord : and ye say well ; for so i am .
[ eng.14 ] if i then , your lord and master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet .
[ eng.15 ] for i have given you an example , that ye should do as i have done to you .
[ eng.16 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , the servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
[ eng.17 ] if ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
[ eng.18 ] i speak not of you all : i know whom i have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
[ eng.19 ] now i tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that i am he .
[ eng.20 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
[ eng.21 ] when jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , verily , verily , i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
[ eng.22 ] then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
[ eng.23 ] now there was leaning on jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom jesus loved .
[ eng.24 ] simon peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
[ eng.25 ] he then lying on jesus ' breast saith unto him , lord , who is it ?
[ eng.26 ] jesus answered , he it is , to whom i shall give a sop , when i have dipped it . and when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to judas iscariot , the son of simon .
[ eng.27 ] and after the sop satan entered into him . then said jesus unto him , that thou doest , do quickly .
[ eng.28 ] now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
[ eng.29 ] for some of them thought , because judas had the bag , that jesus had said unto him , buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
[ eng.30 ] he then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
[ eng.31 ] therefore , when he was gone out , jesus said , now is the son of man glorified , and god is glorified in him .
[ eng.32 ] if god be glorified in him , god shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
[ eng.33 ] little children , yet a little while i am with you . ye shall seek me : and as i said unto the jews , whither i go , ye cannot come ; so now i say to you .
[ eng.34 ] a new commandment i give unto you , that ye love one another ; as i have loved you , that ye also love one another .
[ eng.35 ] by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
[ eng.36 ] simon peter said unto him , lord , whither goest thou ? jesus answered him , whither i go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
[ eng.37 ] peter said unto him , lord , why cannot i follow thee now ? i will lay down my life for thy sake .
[ eng.38 ] jesus answered him , wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily , verily , i say unto thee , the cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
[ eng.1 ] let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in god , believe also in me .
[ eng.2 ] in my father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , i would have told you . i go to prepare a place for you .
[ eng.3 ] and if i go and prepare a place for you , i will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where i am , there ye may be also .
[ eng.4 ] and whither i go ye know , and the way ye know .
[ eng.5 ] thomas saith unto him , lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
[ eng.6 ] jesus saith unto him , i am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the father , but by me .
[ eng.7 ] if ye had known me , ye should have known my father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
[ eng.8 ] philip saith unto him , lord , shew us the father , and it sufficeth us .
[ eng.9 ] jesus saith unto him , have i been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the father ; and how sayest thou then , shew us the father ?
[ eng.10 ] believest thou not that i am in the father , and the father in me ? the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself : but the father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
[ eng.11 ] believe me that i am in the father , and the father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
[ eng.12 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth on me , the works that i do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because i go unto my father .
[ eng.13 ] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will i do , that the father may be glorified in the son .
[ eng.14 ] if ye shall ask any thing in my name , i will do it .
[ eng.15 ] if ye love me , keep my commandments .
[ eng.16 ] and i will pray the father , and he shall give you another comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
[ eng.17 ] even the spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
[ eng.18 ] i will not leave you comfortless : i will come to you .
[ eng.19 ] yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because i live , ye shall live also .
[ eng.20 ] at that day ye shall know that i am in my father , and ye in me , and i in you .
[ eng.21 ] he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father , and i will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
[ eng.22 ] judas saith unto him , not iscariot , lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
[ eng.23 ] jesus answered and said unto him , if a man love me , he will keep my words : and my father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
[ eng.24 ] he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the father 's which sent me .
[ eng.25 ] these things have i spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
[ eng.26 ] but the comforter , which is the holy ghost , whom the father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever i have said unto you .
[ eng.27 ] peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you : not as the world giveth , give i unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
[ eng.28 ] ye have heard how i said unto you , i go away , and come again unto you . if ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because i said , i go unto the father : for my father is greater than i .
[ eng.29 ] and now i have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
[ eng.30 ] hereafter i will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me .
[ eng.31 ] but that the world may know that i love the father ; and as the father gave me commandment , even so i do . arise , let us go hence .
[ eng.1 ] i am the true vine , and my father is the husbandman .
[ eng.2 ] every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
[ eng.3 ] now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you .
[ eng.4 ] abide in me , and i in you . as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
[ eng.5 ] i am the vine , ye are the branches : he that abideth in me , and i in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
[ eng.6 ] if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
[ eng.7 ] if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
[ eng.8 ] herein is my father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
[ eng.9 ] as the father hath loved me , so have i loved you : continue ye in my love .
[ eng.10 ] if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as i have kept my father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
[ eng.11 ] these things have i spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
[ eng.12 ] this is my commandment , that ye love one another , as i have loved you .
[ eng.13 ] greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
[ eng.14 ] ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever i command you .
[ eng.15 ] henceforth i call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but i have called you friends ; for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you .
[ eng.16 ] ye have not chosen me , but i have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name , he may give it you .
[ eng.17 ] these things i command you , that ye love one another .
[ eng.18 ] if the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
[ eng.19 ] if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but i have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
[ eng.20 ] remember the word that i said unto you , the servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
[ eng.21 ] but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
[ eng.22 ] if i had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloak for their sin .
[ eng.23 ] he that hateth me hateth my father also .
[ eng.24 ] if i had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father .
[ eng.25 ] but this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , they hated me without a cause .
[ eng.26 ] but when the comforter is come , whom i will send unto you from the father , even the spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the father , he shall testify of me :
[ eng.27 ] and ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
[ eng.1 ] these things have i spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended .
[ eng.2 ] they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service .
[ eng.3 ] and these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the father , nor me .
[ eng.4 ] but these things have i told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that i told you of them . and these things i said not unto you at the beginning , because i was with you .
[ eng.5 ] but now i go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , whither goest thou ?
[ eng.6 ] but because i have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
[ eng.7 ] nevertheless i tell you the truth ; it is expedient for you that i go away : for if i go not away , the comforter will not come unto you ; but if i depart , i will send him unto you .
[ eng.8 ] and when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
[ eng.9 ] of sin , because they believe not on me ;
[ eng.10 ] of righteousness , because i go to my father , and ye see me no more ;
[ eng.11 ] of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
[ eng.12 ] i have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
[ eng.13 ] howbeit when he , the spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
[ eng.14 ] he shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
[ eng.15 ] all things that the father hath are mine : therefore said i , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
[ eng.16 ] a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because i go to the father .
[ eng.17 ] then said some of his disciples among themselves , what is this that he saith unto us , a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , because i go to the father ?
[ eng.18 ] they said therefore , what is this that he saith , a little while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
[ eng.19 ] now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said , a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
[ eng.20 ] verily , verily , i say unto you , that ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
[ eng.21 ] a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
[ eng.22 ] and ye now therefore have sorrow : but i will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
[ eng.23 ] and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily , verily , i say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name , he will give it you .
[ eng.24 ] hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
[ eng.25 ] these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but i shall shew you plainly of the father .
[ eng.26 ] at that day ye shall ask in my name : and i say not unto you , that i will pray the father for you :
[ eng.27 ] for the father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that i came out from god .
[ eng.28 ] i came forth from the father , and am come into the world : again , i leave the world , and go to the father .
[ eng.29 ] his disciples said unto him , lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb .
[ eng.30 ] now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from god .
[ eng.31 ] jesus answered them , do ye now believe ?
[ eng.32 ] behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet i am not alone , because the father is with me .
[ eng.33 ] these things i have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; i have overcome the world .
[ eng.1 ] these words spake jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , father , the hour is come ; glorify thy son , that thy son also may glorify thee :
[ eng.2 ] as thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
[ eng.3 ] and this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true god , and jesus christ , whom thou hast sent .
[ eng.4 ] i have glorified thee on the earth : i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
[ eng.5 ] and now , o father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was .
[ eng.6 ] i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
[ eng.7 ] now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
[ eng.8 ] for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that i came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
[ eng.9 ] i pray for them : i pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
[ eng.10 ] and all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and i am glorified in them .
[ eng.11 ] and now i am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and i come to thee . holy father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
[ eng.12 ] while i was with them in the world , i kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me i have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
[ eng.13 ] and now come i to thee ; and these things i speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
[ eng.14 ] i have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
[ eng.15 ] i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
[ eng.16 ] they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
[ eng.17 ] sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
[ eng.18 ] as thou hast sent me into the world , even so have i also sent them into the world .
[ eng.19 ] and for their sakes i sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
[ eng.20 ] neither pray i for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
[ eng.21 ] that they all may be one ; as thou , father , art in me , and i in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
[ eng.22 ] and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
[ eng.23 ] i in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
[ eng.24 ] father , i will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where i am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
[ eng.25 ] o righteous father , the world hath not known thee : but i have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
[ eng.26 ] and i have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and i in them .
[ eng.1 ] when jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
[ eng.2 ] and judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
[ eng.3 ] judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
[ eng.4 ] jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , whom seek ye ?
[ eng.5 ] they answered him , jesus of nazareth . jesus saith unto them , i am he . and judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
[ eng.6 ] as soon then as he had said unto them , i am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
[ eng.7 ] then asked he them again , whom seek ye ? and they said , jesus of nazareth .
[ eng.8 ] jesus answered , i have told you that i am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
[ eng.9 ] that the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , of them which thou gavest me have i lost none .
[ eng.10 ] then simon peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was malchus .
[ eng.11 ] then said jesus unto peter , put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my father hath given me , shall i not drink it ?
[ eng.12 ] then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus , and bound him ,
[ eng.13 ] and led him away to annas first ; for he was father in law to caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
[ eng.14 ] now caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
[ eng.15 ] and simon peter followed jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest .
[ eng.16 ] but peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in peter .
[ eng.17 ] then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter , art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? he saith , i am not .
[ eng.18 ] and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
[ eng.19 ] the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
[ eng.20 ] jesus answered him , i spake openly to the world ; i ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the jews always resort ; and in secret have i said nothing .
[ eng.21 ] why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what i have said unto them : behold , they know what i said .
[ eng.22 ] and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , answerest thou the high priest so ?
[ eng.23 ] jesus answered him , if i have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
[ eng.24 ] now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest .
[ eng.25 ] and simon peter stood and warmed himself . they said therefore unto him , art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it , and said , i am not .
[ eng.26 ] one of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off , saith , did not i see thee in the garden with him ?
[ eng.27 ] peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
[ eng.28 ] then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
[ eng.29 ] pilate then went out unto them , and said , what accusation bring ye against this man ?
[ eng.30 ] they answered and said unto him , if he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
[ eng.31 ] then said pilate unto them , take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the jews therefore said unto him , it is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
[ eng.32 ] that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
[ eng.33 ] then pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called jesus , and said unto him , art thou the king of the jews ?
[ eng.34 ] jesus answered him , sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
[ eng.35 ] pilate answered , am i a jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
[ eng.36 ] jesus answered , my kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that i should not be delivered to the jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
[ eng.37 ] pilate therefore said unto him , art thou a king then ? jesus answered , thou sayest that i am a king . to this end was i born , and for this cause came i into the world , that i should bear witness unto the truth . every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
[ eng.38 ] pilate saith unto him , what is truth ? and when he had said this , he went out again unto the jews , and saith unto them , i find in him no fault at all .
[ eng.39 ] but ye have a custom , that i should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
[ eng.40 ] then cried they all again , saying , not this man , but barabbas . now barabbas was a robber .
[ eng.1 ] then pilate therefore took jesus , and scourged him .
[ eng.2 ] and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
[ eng.3 ] and said , hail , king of the jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
[ eng.4 ] pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , behold , i bring him forth to you , that ye may know that i find no fault in him .
[ eng.5 ] then came jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . and pilate saith unto them , behold the man !
[ eng.6 ] when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , crucify him , crucify him . pilate saith unto them , take ye him , and crucify him : for i find no fault in him .
[ eng.7 ] the jews answered him , we have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the son of god .
[ eng.8 ] when pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
[ eng.9 ] and went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto jesus , whence art thou ? but jesus gave him no answer .
[ eng.10 ] then saith pilate unto him , speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
[ eng.11 ] jesus answered , thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
[ eng.12 ] and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him : but the jews cried out , saying , if thou let this man go , thou art not caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar .
[ eng.13 ] when pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the hebrew , gabbatha .
[ eng.14 ] and it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the jews , behold your king !
[ eng.15 ] but they cried out , away with him , away with him , crucify him . pilate saith unto them , shall i crucify your king ? the chief priests answered , we have no king but caesar .
[ eng.16 ] then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . and they took jesus , and led him away .
[ eng.17 ] and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the hebrew golgotha :
[ eng.18 ] where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and jesus in the midst .
[ eng.19 ] and pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews .
[ eng.20 ] this title then read many of the jews : for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in hebrew , and greek , and latin .
[ eng.21 ] then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate , write not , the king of the jews ; but that he said , i am king of the jews .
[ eng.22 ] pilate answered , what i have written i have written .
[ eng.23 ] then the soldiers , when they had crucified jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
[ eng.24 ] they said therefore among themselves , let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , they parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . these things therefore the soldiers did .
[ eng.25 ] now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , mary the wife of cleophas , and mary magdalene .
[ eng.26 ] when jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , woman , behold thy son !
[ eng.27 ] then saith he to the disciple , behold thy mother ! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
[ eng.28 ] after this , jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , i thirst .
[ eng.29 ] now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
[ eng.30 ] when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
[ eng.31 ] the jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
[ eng.32 ] then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
[ eng.33 ] but when they came to jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
[ eng.34 ] but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
[ eng.35 ] and he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
[ eng.36 ] for these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , a bone of him shall not be broken .
[ eng.37 ] and again another scripture saith , they shall look on him whom they pierced .
[ eng.38 ] and after this joseph of arimathaea , being a disciple of jesus , but secretly for fear of the jews , besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus : and pilate gave him leave . he came therefore , and took the body of jesus .
[ eng.39 ] and there came also nicodemus , which at the first came to jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
[ eng.40 ] then took they the body of jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the jews is to bury .
[ eng.41 ] now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
[ eng.42 ] there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
[ eng.1 ] the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
[ eng.2 ] then she runneth , and cometh to simon peter , and to the other disciple , whom jesus loved , and saith unto them , they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
[ eng.3 ] peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
[ eng.4 ] so they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
[ eng.5 ] and he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
[ eng.6 ] then cometh simon peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
[ eng.7 ] and the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
[ eng.8 ] then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
[ eng.9 ] for as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
[ eng.10 ] then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
[ eng.11 ] but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
[ eng.12 ] and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain .
[ eng.13 ] and they say unto her , woman , why weepest thou ? she saith unto them , because they have taken away my lord , and i know not where they have laid him .
[ eng.14 ] and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw jesus standing , and knew not that it was jesus .
[ eng.15 ] jesus saith unto her , woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? she , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and i will take him away .
[ eng.16 ] jesus saith unto her , mary . she turned herself , and saith unto him , rabboni ; which is to say , master .
[ eng.17 ] jesus saith unto her , touch me not ; for i am not yet ascended to my father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , i ascend unto my father , and your father ; and to my god , and your god .
[ eng.18 ] mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
[ eng.19 ] then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews , came jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
[ eng.20 ] and when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . then were the disciples glad , when they saw the lord .
[ eng.21 ] then said jesus to them again , peace be unto you : as my father hath sent me , even so send i you .
[ eng.22 ] and when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , receive ye the holy ghost :
[ eng.23 ] whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
[ eng.24 ] but thomas , one of the twelve , called didymus , was not with them when jesus came .
[ eng.25 ] the other disciples therefore said unto him , we have seen the lord . but he said unto them , except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , i will not believe .
[ eng.26 ] and after eight days again his disciples were within , and thomas with them : then came jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , peace be unto you .
[ eng.27 ] then saith he to thomas , reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
[ eng.28 ] and thomas answered and said unto him , my lord and my god .
[ eng.29 ] jesus saith unto him , thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
[ eng.30 ] and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
[ eng.31 ] but these are written , that ye might believe that jesus is the christ , the son of god ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
[ eng.1 ] after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself .
[ eng.2 ] there were together simon peter , and thomas called didymus , and nathanael of cana in galilee , and the sons of zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
[ eng.3 ] simon peter saith unto them , i go a fishing . they say unto him , we also go with thee . they went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
[ eng.4 ] but when the morning was now come , jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was jesus .
[ eng.5 ] then jesus saith unto them , children , have ye any meat ? they answered him , no .
[ eng.6 ] and he said unto them , cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . they cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
[ eng.7 ] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter , it is the lord . now when simon peter heard that it was the lord , he girt his fisher 's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
[ eng.8 ] and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
[ eng.9 ] as soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
[ eng.10 ] jesus saith unto them , bring of the fish which ye have now caught .
[ eng.11 ] simon peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
[ eng.12 ] jesus saith unto them , come and dine . and none of the disciples durst ask him , who art thou ? knowing that it was the lord .
[ eng.13 ] jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise .
[ eng.14 ] this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
[ eng.15 ] so when they had dined , jesus saith to simon peter , simon , son of jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? he saith unto him , yea , lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him , feed my lambs .
[ eng.16 ] he saith to him again the second time , simon , son of jonas , lovest thou me ? he saith unto him , yea , lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him , feed my sheep .
[ eng.17 ] he saith unto him the third time , simon , son of jonas , lovest thou me ? peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , lovest thou me ? and he said unto him , lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that i love thee . jesus saith unto him , feed my sheep .
[ eng.18 ] verily , verily , i say unto thee , when thou wast young , thou girdest thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
[ eng.19 ] this spake he , signifying by what death he should glorify god . and when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , follow me .
[ eng.20 ] then peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ?
[ eng.21 ] peter seeing him saith to jesus , lord , and what shall this man do ?
[ eng.22 ] jesus saith unto him , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
[ eng.23 ] then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet jesus said not unto him , he shall not die ; but , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ?
[ eng.24 ] this is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
[ eng.25 ] and there are also many other things which jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . amen .
[ eng.1 ] the book of the generation of jesus christ , the son of david , the son of abraham .
[ eng.2 ] abraham begat isaac ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat judas and his brethren ;
[ eng.3 ] and judas begat phares and zara of thamar ; and phares begat esrom ; and esrom begat aram ;
[ eng.4 ] and aram begat aminadab ; and aminadab begat naasson ; and naasson begat salmon ;
[ eng.5 ] and salmon begat booz of rachab ; and booz begat obed of ruth ; and obed begat jesse ;
[ eng.6 ] and jesse begat david the king ; and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias ;
[ eng.7 ] and solomon begat roboam ; and roboam begat abia ; and abia begat asa ;
[ eng.8 ] and asa begat josaphat ; and josaphat begat joram ; and joram begat ozias ;
[ eng.9 ] and ozias begat joatham ; and joatham begat achaz ; and achaz begat ezekias ;
[ eng.10 ] and ezekias begat manasses ; and manasses begat amon ; and amon begat josias ;
[ eng.11 ] and josias begat jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to babylon :
[ eng.12 ] and after they were brought to babylon , jechonias begat salathiel ; and salathiel begat zorobabel ;
[ eng.13 ] and zorobabel begat abiud ; and abiud begat eliakim ; and eliakim begat azor ;
[ eng.14 ] and azor begat sadoc ; and sadoc begat achim ; and achim begat eliud ;
[ eng.15 ] and eliud begat eleazar ; and eleazar begat matthan ; and matthan begat jacob ;
[ eng.16 ] and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary , of whom was born jesus , who is called christ .
[ eng.17 ] so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations ; and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations .
[ eng.18 ] now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise : when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the holy ghost .
[ eng.19 ] then joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
[ eng.20 ] but while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , joseph , thou son of david , fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost .
[ eng.21 ] and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
[ eng.22 ] now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet , saying ,
[ eng.23 ] behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name emmanuel , which being interpreted is , god with us .
[ eng.24 ] then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
[ eng.25 ] and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name jesus .
[ eng.1 ] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to jerusalem ,
[ eng.2 ] saying , where is he that is born king of the jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
[ eng.3 ] when herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all jerusalem with him .
[ eng.4 ] and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where christ should be born .
[ eng.5 ] and they said unto him , in bethlehem of judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
[ eng.6 ] and thou bethlehem , in the land of juda , art not the least among the princes of juda : for out of thee shall come a governor , that shall rule my people israel .
[ eng.7 ] then herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
[ eng.8 ] and he sent them to bethlehem , and said , go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that i may come and worship him also .
[ eng.9 ] when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
[ eng.10 ] when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
[ eng.11 ] and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense and myrrh .
[ eng.12 ] and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod , they departed into their own country another way .
[ eng.13 ] and when they were departed , behold , the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream , saying , arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into egypt , and be thou there until i bring thee word : for herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
[ eng.14 ] when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into egypt :
[ eng.15 ] and was there until the death of herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet , saying , out of egypt have i called my son .
[ eng.16 ] then herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
[ eng.17 ] then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet , saying ,
[ eng.18 ] in rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
[ eng.19 ] but when herod was dead , behold , an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt ,
[ eng.20 ] saying , arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
[ eng.21 ] and he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of israel .
[ eng.22 ] but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of god in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of galilee :
[ eng.23 ] and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , he shall be called a nazarene .
[ eng.1 ] in those days came john the baptist , preaching in the wilderness of judaea ,
[ eng.2 ] and saying , repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
[ eng.3 ] for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias , saying , the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
[ eng.4 ] and the same john had his raiment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
[ eng.5 ] then went out to him jerusalem , and all judaea , and all the region round about jordan ,
[ eng.6 ] and were baptized of him in jordan , confessing their sins .
[ eng.7 ] but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , o generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
[ eng.8 ] bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
[ eng.9 ] and think not to say within yourselves , we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you , that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
[ eng.10 ] and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
[ eng.11 ] i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than i , whose shoes i am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost , and with fire :
[ eng.12 ] whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
[ eng.13 ] then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .
[ eng.14 ] but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
[ eng.15 ] and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
[ eng.16 ] and jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
[ eng.17 ] and lo a voice from heaven , saying , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
[ eng.1 ] then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
[ eng.2 ] and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
[ eng.3 ] and when the tempter came to him , he said , if thou be the son of god , command that these stones be made bread .
[ eng.4 ] but he answered and said , it is written , man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god .
[ eng.5 ] then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
[ eng.6 ] and saith unto him , if thou be the son of god , cast thyself down : for it is written , he shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
[ eng.7 ] jesus said unto him , it is written again , thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
[ eng.8 ] again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
[ eng.9 ] and saith unto him , all these things will i give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
[ eng.10 ] then saith jesus unto him , get thee hence , satan : for it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .
[ eng.11 ] then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
[ eng.12 ] now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison , he departed into galilee ;
[ eng.13 ] and leaving nazareth , he came and dwelt in capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim :
[ eng.14 ] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet , saying ,
[ eng.15 ] the land of zabulon , and the land of nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond jordan , galilee of the gentiles ;
[ eng.16 ] the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
[ eng.17 ] from that time jesus began to preach , and to say , repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
[ eng.18 ] and jesus , walking by the sea of galilee , saw two brethren , simon called peter , and andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
[ eng.19 ] and he saith unto them , follow me , and i will make you fishers of men .
[ eng.20 ] and they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
[ eng.21 ] and going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , in a ship with zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
[ eng.22 ] and they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
[ eng.23 ] and jesus went about all galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
[ eng.24 ] and his fame went throughout all syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .
[ eng.25 ] and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee , and from decapolis , and from jerusalem , and from judaea , and from beyond jordan .
[ eng.1 ] and seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
[ eng.2 ] and he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
[ eng.3 ] blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.4 ] blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
[ eng.5 ] blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
[ eng.6 ] blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
[ eng.7 ] blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
[ eng.8 ] blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see god .
[ eng.9 ] blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of god .
[ eng.10 ] blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.11 ] blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
[ eng.12 ] rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
[ eng.13 ] ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
[ eng.14 ] ye are the light of the world . a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
[ eng.15 ] neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
[ eng.16 ] let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your father which is in heaven .
[ eng.17 ] think not that i am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : i am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
[ eng.18 ] for verily i say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
[ eng.19 ] whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.20 ] for i say unto you , that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.21 ] ye have heard that it was said of them of old time , thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
[ eng.22 ] but i say unto you , that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
[ eng.23 ] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
[ eng.24 ] leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
[ eng.25 ] agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
[ eng.26 ] verily i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
[ eng.27 ] ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , thou shalt not commit adultery :
[ eng.28 ] but i say unto you , that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
[ eng.29 ] and if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
[ eng.30 ] and if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
[ eng.31 ] it hath been said , whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
[ eng.32 ] but i say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
[ eng.33 ] again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths :
[ eng.34 ] but i say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is god 's throne :
[ eng.35 ] nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great king .
[ eng.36 ] neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
[ eng.37 ] but let your communication be , yea , yea ; nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
[ eng.38 ] ye have heard that it hath been said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
[ eng.39 ] but i say unto you , that ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
[ eng.40 ] and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
[ eng.41 ] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain .
[ eng.42 ] give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
[ eng.43 ] ye have heard that it hath been said , thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
[ eng.44 ] but i say unto you , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
[ eng.45 ] that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
[ eng.46 ] for if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
[ eng.47 ] and if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
[ eng.48 ] be ye therefore perfect , even as your father which is in heaven is perfect .
[ eng.1 ] take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven .
[ eng.2 ] therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . verily i say unto you , they have their reward .
[ eng.3 ] but when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
[ eng.4 ] that thine alms may be in secret : and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
[ eng.5 ] and when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . verily i say unto you , they have their reward .
[ eng.6 ] but thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy father which is in secret ; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
[ eng.7 ] but when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
[ eng.8 ] be not ye therefore like unto them : for your father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
[ eng.9 ] after this manner therefore pray ye : our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
[ eng.10 ] thy kingdom come , thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven .
[ eng.11 ] give us this day our daily bread .
[ eng.12 ] and forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
[ eng.13 ] and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . amen .
[ eng.14 ] for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you :
[ eng.15 ] but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive your trespasses .
[ eng.16 ] moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily i say unto you , they have their reward .
[ eng.17 ] but thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
[ eng.18 ] that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy father which is in secret : and thy father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
[ eng.19 ] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
[ eng.20 ] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
[ eng.21 ] for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
[ eng.22 ] the light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
[ eng.23 ] but if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
[ eng.24 ] no man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye cannot serve god and mammon .
[ eng.25 ] therefore i say unto you , take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
[ eng.26 ] behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly father feedeth them . are ye not much better than they ?
[ eng.27 ] which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
[ eng.28 ] and why take ye thought for raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
[ eng.29 ] and yet i say unto you , that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
[ eng.30 ] wherefore , if god so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , o ye of little faith ?
[ eng.31 ] therefore take no thought , saying , what shall we eat ? or , what shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
[ eng.32 ] ( for after all these things do the gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
[ eng.33 ] but seek ye first the kingdom of god , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
[ eng.34 ] take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
[ eng.1 ] judge not , that ye be not judged .
[ eng.2 ] for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
[ eng.3 ] and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
[ eng.4 ] or how wilt thou say to thy brother , let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
[ eng.5 ] thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
[ eng.6 ] give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
[ eng.7 ] ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
[ eng.8 ] for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
[ eng.9 ] or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
[ eng.10 ] or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
[ eng.11 ] if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
[ eng.12 ] therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
[ eng.13 ] enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
[ eng.14 ] because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
[ eng.15 ] beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
[ eng.16 ] ye shall know them by their fruits . do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
[ eng.17 ] even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
[ eng.18 ] a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
[ eng.19 ] every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
[ eng.20 ] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
[ eng.21 ] not every one that saith unto me , lord , lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.22 ] many will say to me in that day , lord , lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
[ eng.23 ] and then will i profess unto them , i never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
[ eng.24 ] therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , i will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
[ eng.25 ] and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
[ eng.26 ] and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
[ eng.27 ] and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
[ eng.28 ] and it came to pass , when jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
[ eng.29 ] for he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .

[ eng.1 ] when he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
[ eng.2 ] and , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
[ eng.3 ] and jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou clean . and immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
[ eng.4 ] and jesus saith unto him , see thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
[ eng.5 ] and when jesus was entered into capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
[ eng.6 ] and saying , lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
[ eng.7 ] and jesus saith unto him , i will come and heal him .
[ eng.8 ] the centurion answered and said , lord , i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
[ eng.9 ] for i am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and i say to this man , go , and he goeth ; and to another , come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , do this , and he doeth it .
[ eng.10 ] when jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , verily i say unto you , i have not found so great faith , no , not in israel .
[ eng.11 ] and i say unto you , that many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with abraham , and isaac , and jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.12 ] but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.13 ] and jesus said unto the centurion , go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
[ eng.14 ] and when jesus was come into peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
[ eng.15 ] and he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
[ eng.16 ] when the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
[ eng.17 ] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet , saying , himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
[ eng.18 ] now when jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
[ eng.19 ] and a certain scribe came , and said unto him , master , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
[ eng.20 ] and jesus saith unto him , the foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head .
[ eng.21 ] and another of his disciples said unto him , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
[ eng.22 ] but jesus said unto him , follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
[ eng.23 ] and when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
[ eng.24 ] and , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
[ eng.25 ] and his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , lord , save us : we perish .
[ eng.26 ] and he saith unto them , why are ye fearful , o ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
[ eng.27 ] but the men marvelled , saying , what manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
[ eng.28 ] and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
[ eng.29 ] and , behold , they cried out , saying , what have we to do with thee , jesus , thou son of god ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
[ eng.30 ] and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
[ eng.31 ] so the devils besought him , saying , if thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
[ eng.32 ] and he said unto them , go . and when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
[ eng.33 ] and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
[ eng.34 ] and , behold , the whole city came out to meet jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
[ eng.1 ] and he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
[ eng.2 ] and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
[ eng.3 ] and , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , this man blasphemeth .
[ eng.4 ] and jesus knowing their thoughts said , wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
[ eng.5 ] for whether is easier , to say , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , arise , and walk ?
[ eng.6 ] but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
[ eng.7 ] and he arose , and departed to his house .
[ eng.8 ] but when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified god , which had given such power unto men .
[ eng.9 ] and as jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , follow me . and he arose , and followed him .
[ eng.10 ] and it came to pass , as jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
[ eng.11 ] and when the pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , why eateth your master with publicans and sinners ?
[ eng.12 ] but when jesus heard that , he said unto them , they that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
[ eng.13 ] but go ye and learn what that meaneth , i will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for i am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
[ eng.14 ] then came to him the disciples of john , saying , why do we and the pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
[ eng.15 ] and jesus said unto them , can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
[ eng.16 ] no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
[ eng.17 ] neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
[ eng.18 ] while he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , my daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
[ eng.19 ] and jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
[ eng.20 ] and , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
[ eng.21 ] for she said within herself , if i may but touch his garment , i shall be whole .
[ eng.22 ] but jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
[ eng.23 ] and when jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
[ eng.24 ] he said unto them , give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
[ eng.25 ] but when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
[ eng.26 ] and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
[ eng.27 ] and when jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , thou son of david , have mercy on us .
[ eng.28 ] and when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and jesus saith unto them , believe ye that i am able to do this ? they said unto him , yea , lord .
[ eng.29 ] then touched he their eyes , saying , according to your faith be it unto you .
[ eng.30 ] and their eyes were opened ; and jesus straitly charged them , saying , see that no man know it .
[ eng.31 ] but they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
[ eng.32 ] as they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
[ eng.33 ] and when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , it was never so seen in israel .
[ eng.34 ] but the pharisees said , he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
[ eng.35 ] and jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
[ eng.36 ] but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
[ eng.37 ] then saith he unto his disciples , the harvest truly is plenteous , but the labourers are few ;
[ eng.38 ] pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
[ eng.1 ] and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
[ eng.2 ] now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; the first , simon , who is called peter , and andrew his brother ; james the son of zebedee , and john his brother ;
[ eng.3 ] philip , and bartholomew ; thomas , and matthew the publican ; james the son of alphaeus , and lebbaeus , whose surname was thaddaeus ;
[ eng.4 ] simon the canaanite , and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
[ eng.5 ] these twelve jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , go not into the way of the gentiles , and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not :
[ eng.6 ] but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel .
[ eng.7 ] and as ye go , preach , saying , the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
[ eng.8 ] heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
[ eng.9 ] provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
[ eng.10 ] nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
[ eng.11 ] and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
[ eng.12 ] and when ye come into an house , salute it .
[ eng.13 ] and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
[ eng.14 ] and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
[ eng.15 ] verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
[ eng.16 ] behold , i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
[ eng.17 ] but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
[ eng.18 ] and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the gentiles .
[ eng.19 ] but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
[ eng.20 ] for it is not ye that speak , but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you .
[ eng.21 ] and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
[ eng.22 ] and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
[ eng.23 ] but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily i say unto you , ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel , till the son of man be come .
[ eng.24 ] the disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
[ eng.25 ] it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . if they have called the master of the house beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
[ eng.26 ] fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
[ eng.27 ] what i tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
[ eng.28 ] and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
[ eng.29 ] are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father .
[ eng.30 ] but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
[ eng.31 ] fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
[ eng.32 ] whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.33 ] but whosoever shall deny me before men , him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.34 ] think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword .
[ eng.35 ] for i am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
[ eng.36 ] and a man 's foes shall be they of his own household .
[ eng.37 ] he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
[ eng.38 ] and he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
[ eng.39 ] he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
[ eng.40 ] he that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
[ eng.41 ] he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
[ eng.42 ] and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily i say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
[ eng.2 ] now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
[ eng.3 ] and said unto him , art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ?
[ eng.4 ] jesus answered and said unto them , go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see :
[ eng.5 ] the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
[ eng.6 ] and blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
[ eng.7 ] and as they departed , jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john , what went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
[ eng.8 ] but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
[ eng.9 ] but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and more than a prophet .
[ eng.10 ] for this is he , of whom it is written , behold , i send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
[ eng.11 ] verily i say unto you , among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
[ eng.12 ] and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
[ eng.13 ] for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john .
[ eng.14 ] and if ye will receive it , this is elias , which was for to come .
[ eng.15 ] he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.16 ] but whereunto shall i liken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
[ eng.17 ] and saying , we have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
[ eng.18 ] for john came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , he hath a devil .
[ eng.19 ] the son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . but wisdom is justified of her children .
[ eng.20 ] then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
[ eng.21 ] woe unto thee , chorazin ! woe unto thee , bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in tyre and sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
[ eng.22 ] but i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
[ eng.23 ] and thou , capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in sodom , it would have remained until this day .
[ eng.24 ] but i say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
[ eng.25 ] at that time jesus answered and said , i thank thee , o father , lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
[ eng.26 ] even so , father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
[ eng.27 ] all things are delivered unto me of my father : and no man knoweth the son , but the father ; neither knoweth any man the father , save the son , and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him .
[ eng.28 ] come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and i will give you rest .
[ eng.29 ] take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for i am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
[ eng.30 ] for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
[ eng.1 ] at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat .
[ eng.2 ] but when the pharisees saw it , they said unto him , behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
[ eng.3 ] but he said unto them , have ye not read what david did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
[ eng.4 ] how he entered into the house of god , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
[ eng.5 ] or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
[ eng.6 ] but i say unto you , that in this place is one greater than the temple .
[ eng.7 ] but if ye had known what this meaneth , i will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
[ eng.8 ] for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day .
[ eng.9 ] and when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
[ eng.10 ] and , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . and they asked him , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
[ eng.11 ] and he said unto them , what man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
[ eng.12 ] how much then is a man better than a sheep ? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
[ eng.13 ] then saith he to the man , stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
[ eng.14 ] then the pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
[ eng.15 ] but when jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
[ eng.16 ] and charged them that they should not make him known :
[ eng.17 ] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet , saying ,
[ eng.18 ] behold my servant , whom i have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : i will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles .
[ eng.19 ] he shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
[ eng.20 ] a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
[ eng.21 ] and in his name shall the gentiles trust .
[ eng.22 ] then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
[ eng.23 ] and all the people were amazed , and said , is not this the son of david ?
[ eng.24 ] but when the pharisees heard it , they said , this fellow doth not cast out devils , but by beelzebub the prince of the devils .
[ eng.25 ] and jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
[ eng.26 ] and if satan cast out satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
[ eng.27 ] and if i by beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
[ eng.28 ] but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god , then the kingdom of god is come unto you .
[ eng.29 ] or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
[ eng.30 ] he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
[ eng.31 ] wherefore i say unto you , all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
[ eng.32 ] and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
[ eng.33 ] either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
[ eng.34 ] o generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
[ eng.35 ] a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
[ eng.36 ] but i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
[ eng.37 ] for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
[ eng.38 ] then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered , saying , master , we would see a sign from thee .
[ eng.39 ] but he answered and said unto them , an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet jonas :
[ eng.40 ] for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
[ eng.41 ] the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of jonas ; and , behold , a greater than jonas is here .
[ eng.42 ] the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and , behold , a greater than solomon is here .
[ eng.43 ] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
[ eng.44 ] then he saith , i will return into my house from whence i came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
[ eng.45 ] then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
[ eng.46 ] while he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
[ eng.47 ] then one said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
[ eng.48 ] but he answered and said unto him that told him , who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
[ eng.49 ] and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , behold my mother and my brethren !
[ eng.50 ] for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
[ eng.1 ] the same day went jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
[ eng.2 ] and great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
[ eng.3 ] and he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
[ eng.4 ] and when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
[ eng.5 ] some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
[ eng.6 ] and when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
[ eng.7 ] and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
[ eng.8 ] but other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
[ eng.9 ] who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.10 ] and the disciples came , and said unto him , why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
[ eng.11 ] he answered and said unto them , because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
[ eng.12 ] for whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
[ eng.13 ] therefore speak i to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
[ eng.14 ] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias , which saith , by hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
[ eng.15 ] for this people 's heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and i should heal them .
[ eng.16 ] but blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
[ eng.17 ] for verily i say unto you , that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
[ eng.18 ] hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
[ eng.19 ] when any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . this is he which received seed by the way side .
[ eng.20 ] but he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
[ eng.21 ] yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
[ eng.22 ] he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
[ eng.23 ] but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
[ eng.24 ] another parable put he forth unto them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
[ eng.25 ] but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
[ eng.26 ] but when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
[ eng.27 ] so the servants of the householder came and said unto him , sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
[ eng.28 ] he said unto them , an enemy hath done this . the servants said unto him , wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
[ eng.29 ] but he said , nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
[ eng.30 ] let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers , gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
[ eng.31 ] another parable put he forth unto them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
[ eng.32 ] which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
[ eng.33 ] another parable spake he unto them ; the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
[ eng.34 ] all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
[ eng.35 ] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , i will open my mouth in parables ; i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
[ eng.36 ] then jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
[ eng.37 ] he answered and said unto them , he that soweth the good seed is the son of man ;
[ eng.38 ] the field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
[ eng.39 ] the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
[ eng.40 ] as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
[ eng.41 ] the son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
[ eng.42 ] and shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.43 ] then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.44 ] again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
[ eng.45 ] again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
[ eng.46 ] who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
[ eng.47 ] again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
[ eng.48 ] which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
[ eng.49 ] so shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
[ eng.50 ] and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.51 ] jesus saith unto them , have ye understood all these things ? they say unto him , yea , lord .
[ eng.52 ] then said he unto them , therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
[ eng.53 ] and it came to pass , that when jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
[ eng.54 ] and when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
[ eng.55 ] is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called mary ? and his brethren , james , and joses , and simon , and judas ?
[ eng.56 ] and his sisters , are they not all with us ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
[ eng.57 ] and they were offended in him . but jesus said unto them , a prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
[ eng.58 ] and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
[ eng.1 ] at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus ,
[ eng.2 ] and said unto his servants , this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
[ eng.3 ] for herod had laid hold on john , and bound him , and put him in prison for herodias ' sake , his brother philip 's wife .
[ eng.4 ] for john said unto him , it is not lawful for thee to have her .
[ eng.5 ] and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
[ eng.6 ] but when herod 's birthday was kept , the daughter of herodias danced before them , and pleased herod .
[ eng.7 ] whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
[ eng.8 ] and she , being before instructed of her mother , said , give me here john baptist 's head in a charger .
[ eng.9 ] and the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
[ eng.10 ] and he sent , and beheaded john in the prison .
[ eng.11 ] and his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
[ eng.12 ] and his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told jesus .
[ eng.13 ] when jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
[ eng.14 ] and jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
[ eng.15 ] and when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , this is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
[ eng.16 ] but jesus said unto them , they need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
[ eng.17 ] and they say unto him , we have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
[ eng.18 ] he said , bring them hither to me .
[ eng.19 ] and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
[ eng.20 ] and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
[ eng.21 ] and they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
[ eng.22 ] and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
[ eng.23 ] and when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
[ eng.24 ] but the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
[ eng.25 ] and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
[ eng.26 ] and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , it is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
[ eng.27 ] but straightway jesus spake unto them , saying , be of good cheer ; it is i ; be not afraid .
[ eng.28 ] and peter answered him and said , lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
[ eng.29 ] and he said , come . and when peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to jesus .
[ eng.30 ] but when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , lord , save me .
[ eng.31 ] and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , o thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
[ eng.32 ] and when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
[ eng.33 ] then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , of a truth thou art the son of god .
[ eng.34 ] and when they were gone over , they came into the land of gennesaret .
[ eng.35 ] and when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
[ eng.36 ] and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
[ eng.1 ] then came to jesus scribes and pharisees , which were of jerusalem , saying ,
[ eng.2 ] why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
[ eng.3 ] but he answered and said unto them , why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition ?
[ eng.4 ] for god commanded , saying , honour thy father and mother : and , he that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
[ eng.5 ] but ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , it is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
[ eng.6 ] and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition .
[ eng.7 ] ye hypocrites , well did esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
[ eng.8 ] this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
[ eng.9 ] but in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
[ eng.10 ] and he called the multitude , and said unto them , hear , and understand :
[ eng.11 ] not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
[ eng.12 ] then came his disciples , and said unto him , knowest thou that the pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
[ eng.13 ] but he answered and said , every plant , which my heavenly father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
[ eng.14 ] let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
[ eng.15 ] then answered peter and said unto him , declare unto us this parable .
[ eng.16 ] and jesus said , are ye also yet without understanding ?
[ eng.17 ] do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
[ eng.18 ] but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
[ eng.19 ] for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
[ eng.20 ] these are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
[ eng.21 ] then jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon .
[ eng.22 ] and , behold , a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , have mercy on me , o lord , thou son of david ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
[ eng.23 ] but he answered her not a word . and his disciples came and besought him , saying , send her away ; for she crieth after us .
[ eng.24 ] but he answered and said , i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel .
[ eng.25 ] then came she and worshipped him , saying , lord , help me .
[ eng.26 ] but he answered and said , it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to dogs .
[ eng.27 ] and she said , truth , lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
[ eng.28 ] then jesus answered and said unto her , o woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
[ eng.29 ] and jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
[ eng.30 ] and great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
[ eng.31 ] insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the god of israel .
[ eng.32 ] then jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , i have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and i will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
[ eng.33 ] and his disciples say unto him , whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
[ eng.34 ] and jesus saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven , and a few little fishes .
[ eng.35 ] and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
[ eng.36 ] and he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
[ eng.37 ] and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
[ eng.38 ] and they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
[ eng.39 ] and he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of magdala .
[ eng.1 ] the pharisees also with the sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
[ eng.2 ] he answered and said unto them , when it is evening , ye say , it will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
[ eng.3 ] and in the morning , it will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowering . o ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
[ eng.4 ] a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet jonas . and he left them , and departed .
[ eng.5 ] and when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
[ eng.6 ] then jesus said unto them , take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
[ eng.7 ] and they reasoned among themselves , saying , it is because we have taken no bread .
[ eng.8 ] which when jesus perceived , he said unto them , o ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
[ eng.9 ] do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
[ eng.10 ] neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
[ eng.11 ] how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees ?
[ eng.12 ] then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
[ eng.13 ] when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , whom do men say that i the son of man am ?
[ eng.14 ] and they said , some say that thou art john the baptist : some , elias ; and others , jeremias , or one of the prophets .
[ eng.15 ] he saith unto them , but whom say ye that i am ?
[ eng.16 ] and simon peter answered and said , thou art the christ , the son of the living god .
[ eng.17 ] and jesus answered and said unto him , blessed art thou , simon barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.18 ] and i say also unto thee , that thou art peter , and upon this rock i will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
[ eng.19 ] and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
[ eng.20 ] then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ .
[ eng.21 ] from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
[ eng.22 ] then peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , be it far from thee , lord : this shall not be unto thee .
[ eng.23 ] but he turned , and said unto peter , get thee behind me , satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of god , but those that be of men .
[ eng.24 ] then said jesus unto his disciples , if any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
[ eng.25 ] for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
[ eng.26 ] for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
[ eng.27 ] for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
[ eng.28 ] verily i say unto you , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom .
[ eng.1 ] and after six days jesus taketh peter , james , and john his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart ,
[ eng.2 ] and was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
[ eng.3 ] and , behold , there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him .
[ eng.4 ] then answered peter , and said unto jesus , lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias .
[ eng.5 ] while he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased ; hear ye him .
[ eng.6 ] and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
[ eng.7 ] and jesus came and touched them , and said , arise , and be not afraid .
[ eng.8 ] and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save jesus only .
[ eng.9 ] and as they came down from the mountain , jesus charged them , saying , tell the vision to no man , until the son of man be risen again from the dead .
[ eng.10 ] and his disciples asked him , saying , why then say the scribes that elias must first come ?
[ eng.11 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , elias truly shall first come , and restore all things .
[ eng.12 ] but i say unto you , that elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them .
[ eng.13 ] then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist .
[ eng.14 ] and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
[ eng.15 ] lord , have mercy on my son : for he is lunatick , and sore vexed : for ofttimes he falleth into the fire , and oft into the water .
[ eng.16 ] and i brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
[ eng.17 ] then jesus answered and said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
[ eng.18 ] and jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
[ eng.19 ] then came the disciples to jesus apart , and said , why could not we cast him out ?
[ eng.20 ] and jesus said unto them , because of your unbelief : for verily i say unto you , if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
[ eng.21 ] howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting .
[ eng.22 ] and while they abode in galilee , jesus said unto them , the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
[ eng.23 ] and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sorry .
[ eng.24 ] and when they were come to capernaum , they that received tribute money came to peter , and said , doth not your master pay tribute ?
[ eng.25 ] he saith , yes . and when he was come into the house , jesus prevented him , saying , what thinkest thou , simon ? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? of their own children , or of strangers ?
[ eng.26 ] peter saith unto him , of strangers . jesus saith unto him , then are the children free .
[ eng.27 ] notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea , and cast an hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money : that take , and give unto them for me and thee .
[ eng.1 ] at the same time came the disciples unto jesus , saying , who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
[ eng.2 ] and jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
[ eng.3 ] and said , verily i say unto you , except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.4 ] whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.5 ] and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
[ eng.6 ] but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
[ eng.7 ] woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
[ eng.8 ] wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
[ eng.9 ] and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
[ eng.10 ] take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for i say unto you , that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.11 ] for the son of man is come to save that which was lost .
[ eng.12 ] how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
[ eng.13 ] and if so be that he find it , verily i say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
[ eng.14 ] even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
[ eng.15 ] moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
[ eng.16 ] but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
[ eng.17 ] and if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
[ eng.18 ] verily i say unto you , whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
[ eng.19 ] again i say unto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven .
[ eng.20 ] for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them .
[ eng.21 ] then came peter to him , and said , lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? till seven times ?
[ eng.22 ] jesus saith unto him , i say not unto thee , until seven times : but , until seventy times seven .
[ eng.23 ] therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
[ eng.24 ] and when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
[ eng.25 ] but forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
[ eng.26 ] the servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , lord , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
[ eng.27 ] then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
[ eng.28 ] but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , pay me that thou owest .
[ eng.29 ] and his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
[ eng.30 ] and he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
[ eng.31 ] so when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
[ eng.32 ] then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , o thou wicked servant , i forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
[ eng.33 ] shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as i had pity on thee ?
[ eng.34 ] and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
[ eng.35 ] so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that when jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from galilee , and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan ;
[ eng.2 ] and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
[ eng.3 ] the pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
[ eng.4 ] and he answered and said unto them , have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
[ eng.5 ] and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
[ eng.6 ] wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
[ eng.7 ] they say unto him , why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
[ eng.8 ] he saith unto them , moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
[ eng.9 ] and i say unto you , whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
[ eng.10 ] his disciples say unto him , if the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
[ eng.11 ] but he said unto them , all men cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
[ eng.12 ] for there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
[ eng.13 ] then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
[ eng.14 ] but jesus said , suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.15 ] and he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
[ eng.16 ] and , behold , one came and said unto him , good master , what good thing shall i do , that i may have eternal life ?
[ eng.17 ] and he said unto him , why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , god : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
[ eng.18 ] he saith unto him , which ? jesus said , thou shalt do no murder , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness ,
[ eng.19 ] honour thy father and thy mother : and , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
[ eng.20 ] the young man saith unto him , all these things have i kept from my youth up : what lack i yet ?
[ eng.21 ] jesus said unto him , if thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
[ eng.22 ] but when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
[ eng.23 ] then said jesus unto his disciples , verily i say unto you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
[ eng.24 ] and again i say unto you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
[ eng.25 ] when his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , who then can be saved ?
[ eng.26 ] but jesus beheld them , and said unto them , with men this is impossible ; but with god all things are possible .
[ eng.27 ] then answered peter and said unto him , behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
[ eng.28 ] and jesus said unto them , verily i say unto you , that ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of israel .
[ eng.29 ] and every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
[ eng.30 ] but many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
[ eng.1 ] for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
[ eng.2 ] and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
[ eng.3 ] and he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
[ eng.4 ] and said unto them ; go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right i will give you . and they went their way .
[ eng.5 ] again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
[ eng.6 ] and about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , why stand ye here all the day idle ?
[ eng.7 ] they say unto him , because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
[ eng.8 ] so when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
[ eng.9 ] and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
[ eng.10 ] but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
[ eng.11 ] and when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
[ eng.12 ] saying , these last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
[ eng.13 ] but he answered one of them , and said , friend , i do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
[ eng.14 ] take that thine is , and go thy way : i will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
[ eng.15 ] is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own ? is thine eye evil , because i am good ?
[ eng.16 ] so the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
[ eng.17 ] and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
[ eng.18 ] behold , we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
[ eng.19 ] and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
[ eng.20 ] then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
[ eng.21 ] and he said unto her , what wilt thou ? she saith unto him , grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
[ eng.22 ] but jesus answered and said , ye know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ? they say unto him , we are able .
[ eng.23 ] and he saith unto them , ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father .
[ eng.24 ] and when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
[ eng.25 ] but jesus called them unto him , and said , ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
[ eng.26 ] but it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
[ eng.27 ] and whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
[ eng.28 ] even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
[ eng.29 ] and as they departed from jericho , a great multitude followed him .
[ eng.30 ] and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that jesus passed by , cried out , saying , have mercy on us , o lord , thou son of david .
[ eng.31 ] and the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , have mercy on us , o lord , thou son of david .
[ eng.32 ] and jesus stood still , and called them , and said , what will ye that i shall do unto you ?
[ eng.33 ] they say unto him , lord , that our eyes may be opened .
[ eng.34 ] so jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
[ eng.1 ] and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem , and were come to bethphage , unto the mount of olives , then sent jesus two disciples ,
[ eng.2 ] saying unto them , go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
[ eng.3 ] and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , the lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
[ eng.4 ] all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
[ eng.5 ] tell ye the daughter of sion , behold , thy king cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
[ eng.6 ] and the disciples went , and did as jesus commanded them ,
[ eng.7 ] and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
[ eng.8 ] and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
[ eng.9 ] and the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , hosanna to the son of david : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord ; hosanna in the highest .
[ eng.10 ] and when he was come into jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , who is this ?
[ eng.11 ] and the multitude said , this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee .
[ eng.12 ] and jesus went into the temple of god , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
[ eng.13 ] and said unto them , it is written , my house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
[ eng.14 ] and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
[ eng.15 ] and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , hosanna to the son of david ; they were sore displeased ,
[ eng.16 ] and said unto him , hearest thou what these say ? and jesus saith unto them , yea ; have ye never read , out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
[ eng.17 ] and he left them , and went out of the city into bethany ; and he lodged there .
[ eng.18 ] now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
[ eng.19 ] and when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . and presently the fig tree withered away .
[ eng.20 ] and when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , how soon is the fig tree withered away !
[ eng.21 ] jesus answered and said unto them , verily i say unto you , if ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
[ eng.22 ] and all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
[ eng.23 ] and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , by what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
[ eng.24 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , i also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things .
[ eng.25 ] the baptism of john , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say unto us , why did ye not then believe him ?
[ eng.26 ] but if we shall say , of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold john as a prophet .
[ eng.27 ] and they answered jesus , and said , we cannot tell . and he said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
[ eng.28 ] but what think ye ? a certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , son , go work to day in my vineyard .
[ eng.29 ] he answered and said , i will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
[ eng.30 ] and he came to the second , and said likewise . and he answered and said , i go , sir : and went not .
[ eng.31 ] whether of them twain did the will of his father ? they say unto him , the first . jesus saith unto them , verily i say unto you , that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you .
[ eng.32 ] for john came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
[ eng.33 ] hear another parable : there was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
[ eng.34 ] and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
[ eng.35 ] and the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
[ eng.36 ] again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
[ eng.37 ] but last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , they will reverence my son .
[ eng.38 ] but when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
[ eng.39 ] and they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
[ eng.40 ] when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
[ eng.41 ] they say unto him , he will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
[ eng.42 ] jesus saith unto them , did ye never read in the scriptures , the stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
[ eng.43 ] therefore say i unto you , the kingdom of god shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
[ eng.44 ] and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
[ eng.45 ] and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
[ eng.46 ] but when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
[ eng.1 ] and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said ,
[ eng.2 ] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
[ eng.3 ] and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
[ eng.4 ] again , he sent forth other servants , saying , tell them which are bidden , behold , i have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
[ eng.5 ] but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
[ eng.6 ] and the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
[ eng.7 ] but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
[ eng.8 ] then saith he to his servants , the wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
[ eng.9 ] go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
[ eng.10 ] so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
[ eng.11 ] and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
[ eng.12 ] and he saith unto him , friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? and he was speechless .
[ eng.13 ] then said the king to the servants , bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness , there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.14 ] for many are called , but few are chosen .
[ eng.15 ] then went the pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
[ eng.16 ] and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians , saying , master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of god in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
[ eng.17 ] tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
[ eng.18 ] but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
[ eng.19 ] shew me the tribute money . and they brought unto him a penny .
[ eng.20 ] and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ?
[ eng.21 ] they say unto him , caesar 's . then saith he unto them , render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar 's ; and unto god the things that are god 's .
[ eng.22 ] when they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
[ eng.23 ] the same day came to him the sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
[ eng.24 ] saying , master , moses said , if a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
[ eng.25 ] now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
[ eng.26 ] likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
[ eng.27 ] and last of all the woman died also .
[ eng.28 ] therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
[ eng.29 ] jesus answered and said unto them , ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of god .
[ eng.30 ] for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of god in heaven .
[ eng.31 ] but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god , saying ,
[ eng.32 ] i am the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob ? god is not the god of the dead , but of the living .
[ eng.33 ] and when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
[ eng.34 ] but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
[ eng.35 ] then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
[ eng.36 ] master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
[ eng.37 ] jesus said unto him , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
[ eng.38 ] this is the first and great commandment .
[ eng.39 ] and the second is like unto it , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
[ eng.40 ] on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
[ eng.41 ] while the pharisees were gathered together , jesus asked them ,
[ eng.42 ] saying , what think ye of christ ? whose son is he ? they say unto him , the son of david .
[ eng.43 ] he saith unto them , how then doth david in spirit call him lord , saying ,
[ eng.44 ] the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand , till i make thine enemies thy footstool ?
[ eng.45 ] if david then call him lord , how is he his son ?
[ eng.46 ] and no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
[ eng.1 ] then spake jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
[ eng.2 ] saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses ' seat :
[ eng.3 ] all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
[ eng.4 ] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
[ eng.5 ] but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
[ eng.6 ] and love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
[ eng.7 ] and greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , rabbi , rabbi .
[ eng.8 ] but be not ye called rabbi : for one is your master , even christ ; and all ye are brethren .
[ eng.9 ] and call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your father , which is in heaven .
[ eng.10 ] neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even christ .
[ eng.11 ] but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
[ eng.12 ] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
[ eng.13 ] but woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
[ eng.14 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
[ eng.15 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
[ eng.16 ] woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
[ eng.17 ] ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
[ eng.18 ] and , whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
[ eng.19 ] ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
[ eng.20 ] whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
[ eng.21 ] and whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
[ eng.22 ] and he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of god , and by him that sitteth thereon .
[ eng.23 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
[ eng.24 ] ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
[ eng.25 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
[ eng.26 ] thou blind pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
[ eng.27 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
[ eng.28 ] even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
[ eng.29 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
[ eng.30 ] and say , if we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
[ eng.31 ] wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
[ eng.32 ] fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
[ eng.33 ] ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
[ eng.34 ] wherefore , behold , i send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
[ eng.35 ] that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
[ eng.36 ] verily i say unto you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
[ eng.37 ] o jerusalem , jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would i have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
[ eng.38 ] behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
[ eng.39 ] for i say unto you , ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
[ eng.1 ] and jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
[ eng.2 ] and jesus said unto them , see ye not all these things ? verily i say unto you , there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
[ eng.3 ] and as he sat upon the mount of olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
[ eng.4 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , take heed that no man deceive you .
[ eng.5 ] for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and shall deceive many .
[ eng.6 ] and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
[ eng.7 ] for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
[ eng.8 ] all these are the beginning of sorrows .
[ eng.9 ] then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
[ eng.10 ] and then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
[ eng.11 ] and many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
[ eng.12 ] and because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
[ eng.13 ] but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
[ eng.14 ] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
[ eng.15 ] when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
[ eng.16 ] then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains :
[ eng.17 ] let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
[ eng.18 ] neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
[ eng.19 ] and woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
[ eng.20 ] but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
[ eng.21 ] for then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
[ eng.22 ] and except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened .
[ eng.23 ] then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is christ , or there ; believe it not .
[ eng.24 ] for there shall arise false christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
[ eng.25 ] behold , i have told you before .
[ eng.26 ] wherefore if they shall say unto you , behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
[ eng.27 ] for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
[ eng.28 ] for wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
[ eng.29 ] immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
[ eng.30 ] and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
[ eng.31 ] and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
[ eng.32 ] now learn a parable of the fig tree ; when his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
[ eng.33 ] so likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
[ eng.34 ] verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
[ eng.35 ] heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
[ eng.36 ] but of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my father only .
[ eng.37 ] but as the days of noe were , so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
[ eng.38 ] for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that noe entered into the ark ,
[ eng.39 ] and knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
[ eng.40 ] then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
[ eng.41 ] two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
[ eng.42 ] watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your lord doth come .
[ eng.43 ] but know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
[ eng.44 ] therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh .
[ eng.45 ] who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
[ eng.46 ] blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
[ eng.47 ] verily i say unto you , that he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
[ eng.48 ] but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , my lord delayeth his coming ;
[ eng.49 ] and shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
[ eng.50 ] the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
[ eng.51 ] and shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.1 ] then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
[ eng.2 ] and five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
[ eng.3 ] they that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
[ eng.4 ] but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
[ eng.5 ] while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
[ eng.6 ] and at midnight there was a cry made , behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
[ eng.7 ] then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
[ eng.8 ] and the foolish said unto the wise , give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
[ eng.9 ] but the wise answered , saying , not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
[ eng.10 ] and while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
[ eng.11 ] afterward came also the other virgins , saying , lord , lord , open to us .
[ eng.12 ] but he answered and said , verily i say unto you , i know you not .
[ eng.13 ] watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh .
[ eng.14 ] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
[ eng.15 ] and unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
[ eng.16 ] then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
[ eng.17 ] and likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
[ eng.18 ] but he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
[ eng.19 ] after a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
[ eng.20 ] and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , i have gained beside them five talents more .
[ eng.21 ] his lord said unto him , well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
[ eng.22 ] he also that had received two talents came and said , lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , i have gained two other talents beside them .
[ eng.23 ] his lord said unto him , well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
[ eng.24 ] then he which had received the one talent came and said , lord , i knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
[ eng.25 ] and i was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
[ eng.26 ] his lord answered and said unto him , thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not , and gather where i have not strawed :
[ eng.27 ] thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury .
[ eng.28 ] take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
[ eng.29 ] for unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
[ eng.30 ] and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
[ eng.31 ] when the son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
[ eng.32 ] and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
[ eng.33 ] and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
[ eng.34 ] then shall the king say unto them on his right hand , come , ye blessed of my father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
[ eng.35 ] for i was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : i was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : i was a stranger , and ye took me in :
[ eng.36 ] naked , and ye clothed me : i was sick , and ye visited me : i was in prison , and ye came unto me .
[ eng.37 ] then shall the righteous answer him , saying , lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
[ eng.38 ] when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
[ eng.39 ] or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
[ eng.40 ] and the king shall answer and say unto them , verily i say unto you , inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
[ eng.41 ] then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
[ eng.42 ] for i was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : i was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
[ eng.43 ] i was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
[ eng.44 ] then shall they also answer him , saying , lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
[ eng.45 ] then shall he answer them , saying , verily i say unto you , inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
[ eng.46 ] and these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , when jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
[ eng.2 ] ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
[ eng.3 ] then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called caiaphas ,
[ eng.4 ] and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
[ eng.5 ] but they said , not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
[ eng.6 ] now when jesus was in bethany , in the house of simon the leper ,
[ eng.7 ] there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
[ eng.8 ] but when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , to what purpose is this waste ?
[ eng.9 ] for this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
[ eng.10 ] when jesus understood it , he said unto them , why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
[ eng.11 ] for ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
[ eng.12 ] for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
[ eng.13 ] verily i say unto you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
[ eng.14 ] then one of the twelve , called judas iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
[ eng.15 ] and said unto them , what will ye give me , and i will deliver him unto you ? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
[ eng.16 ] and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
[ eng.17 ] now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus , saying unto him , where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
[ eng.18 ] and he said , go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , the master saith , my time is at hand ; i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
[ eng.19 ] and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
[ eng.20 ] now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
[ eng.21 ] and as they did eat , he said , verily i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
[ eng.22 ] and they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , lord , is it i ?
[ eng.23 ] and he answered and said , he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
[ eng.24 ] the son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
[ eng.25 ] then judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , master , is it i ? he said unto him , thou hast said .
[ eng.26 ] and as they were eating , jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , take , eat ; this is my body .
[ eng.27 ] and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , drink ye all of it ;
[ eng.28 ] for this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
[ eng.29 ] but i say unto you , i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when i drink it new with you in my father 's kingdom .
[ eng.30 ] and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
[ eng.31 ] then saith jesus unto them , all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , i will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
[ eng.32 ] but after i am risen again , i will go before you into galilee .
[ eng.33 ] peter answered and said unto him , though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will i never be offended .
[ eng.34 ] jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
[ eng.35 ] peter said unto him , though i should die with thee , yet will i not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
[ eng.36 ] then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , sit ye here , while i go and pray yonder .
[ eng.37 ] and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
[ eng.38 ] then saith he unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
[ eng.39 ] and he went a little farther , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , o my father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as i will , but as thou wilt .
[ eng.40 ] and he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto peter , what , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
[ eng.41 ] watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
[ eng.42 ] he went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , o my father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except i drink it , thy will be done .
[ eng.43 ] and he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
[ eng.44 ] and he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
[ eng.45 ] then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
[ eng.46 ] rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
[ eng.47 ] and while he yet spake , lo , judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
[ eng.48 ] now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
[ eng.49 ] and forthwith he came to jesus , and said , hail , master ; and kissed him .
[ eng.50 ] and jesus said unto him , friend , wherefore art thou come ? then came they , and laid hands on jesus and took him .
[ eng.51 ] and , behold , one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
[ eng.52 ] then said jesus unto him , put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
[ eng.53 ] thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
[ eng.54 ] but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
[ eng.55 ] in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes , are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? i sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
[ eng.56 ] but all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
[ eng.57 ] and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
[ eng.58 ] but peter followed him afar off unto the high priest 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
[ eng.59 ] now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against jesus , to put him to death ;
[ eng.60 ] but found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . at the last came two false witnesses ,
[ eng.61 ] and said , this fellow said , i am able to destroy the temple of god , and to build it in three days .
[ eng.62 ] and the high priest arose , and said unto him , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
[ eng.63 ] but jesus held his peace , and the high priest answered and said unto him , i adjure thee by the living god , that thou tell us whether thou be the christ , the son of god .
[ eng.64 ] jesus saith unto him , thou hast said : nevertheless i say unto you , hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
[ eng.65 ] then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , he hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
[ eng.66 ] what think ye ? they answered and said , he is guilty of death .
[ eng.67 ] then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
[ eng.68 ] saying , prophesy unto us , thou christ , who is he that smote thee ?
[ eng.69 ] now peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , thou also wast with jesus of galilee .
[ eng.70 ] but he denied before them all , saying , i know not what thou sayest .
[ eng.71 ] and when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth .
[ eng.72 ] and again he denied with an oath , i do not know the man .
[ eng.73 ] and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to peter , surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
[ eng.74 ] then began he to curse and to swear , saying , i know not the man . and immediately the cock crew .
[ eng.75 ] and peter remembered the word of jesus , which said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
[ eng.1 ] when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death :
[ eng.2 ] and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor .
[ eng.3 ] then judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
[ eng.4 ] saying , i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood . and they said , what is that to us ? see thou to that .
[ eng.5 ] and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
[ eng.6 ] and the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
[ eng.7 ] and they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in .
[ eng.8 ] wherefore that field was called , the field of blood , unto this day .
[ eng.9 ] then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet , saying , and they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of israel did value ;
[ eng.10 ] and gave them for the potter 's field , as the lord appointed me .
[ eng.11 ] and jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and jesus said unto him , thou sayest .
[ eng.12 ] and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
[ eng.13 ] then said pilate unto him , hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
[ eng.14 ] and he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
[ eng.15 ] now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
[ eng.16 ] and they had then a notable prisoner , called barabbas .
[ eng.17 ] therefore when they were gathered together , pilate said unto them , whom will ye that i release unto you ? barabbas , or jesus which is called christ ?
[ eng.18 ] for he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
[ eng.19 ] when he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , have thou nothing to do with that just man : for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
[ eng.20 ] but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas , and destroy jesus .
[ eng.21 ] the governor answered and said unto them , whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you ? they said , barabbas .
[ eng.22 ] pilate saith unto them , what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ ? they all say unto him , let him be crucified .
[ eng.23 ] and the governor said , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more , saying , let him be crucified .
[ eng.24 ] when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , i am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
[ eng.25 ] then answered all the people , and said , his blood be on us , and on our children .
[ eng.26 ] then released he barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
[ eng.27 ] then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
[ eng.28 ] and they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
[ eng.29 ] and when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , hail , king of the jews !
[ eng.30 ] and they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
[ eng.31 ] and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
[ eng.32 ] and as they came out , they found a man of cyrene , simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
[ eng.33 ] and when they were come unto a place called golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
[ eng.34 ] they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
[ eng.35 ] and they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , they parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
[ eng.36 ] and sitting down they watched him there ;
[ eng.37 ] and set up over his head his accusation written , this is jesus the king of the jews .
[ eng.38 ] then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
[ eng.39 ] and they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
[ eng.40 ] and saying , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . if thou be the son of god , come down from the cross .
[ eng.41 ] likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
[ eng.42 ] he saved others ; himself he cannot save . if he be the king of israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
[ eng.43 ] he trusted in god ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , i am the son of god .
[ eng.44 ] the thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
[ eng.45 ] now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
[ eng.46 ] and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , eli , eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ?
[ eng.47 ] some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , this man calleth for elias .
[ eng.48 ] and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
[ eng.49 ] the rest said , let be , let us see whether elias will come to save him .
[ eng.50 ] jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
[ eng.51 ] and , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
[ eng.52 ] and the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
[ eng.53 ] and came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
[ eng.54 ] now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , truly this was the son of god .
[ eng.55 ] and many women were there beholding afar off , which followed jesus from galilee , ministering unto him :
[ eng.56 ] among which was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james and joses , and the mother of zebedees children .
[ eng.57 ] when the even was come , there came a rich man of arimathaea , named joseph , who also himself was jesus ' disciple :
[ eng.58 ] he went to pilate , and begged the body of jesus . then pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
[ eng.59 ] and when joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
[ eng.60 ] and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
[ eng.61 ] and there was mary magdalene , and the other mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
[ eng.62 ] now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate ,
[ eng.63 ] saying , sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , after three days i will rise again .
[ eng.64 ] command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , he is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
[ eng.65 ] pilate said unto them , ye have a watch : go your way , make it as sure as ye can .
[ eng.66 ] so they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
[ eng.1 ] in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre .
[ eng.2 ] and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
[ eng.3 ] his countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
[ eng.4 ] and for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
[ eng.5 ] and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear not ye : for i know that ye seek jesus , which was crucified .
[ eng.6 ] he is not here : for he is risen , as he said . come , see the place where the lord lay .
[ eng.7 ] and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , i have told you .
[ eng.8 ] and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
[ eng.9 ] and as they went to tell his disciples , behold , jesus met them , saying , all hail . and they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
[ eng.10 ] then said jesus unto them , be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into galilee , and there shall they see me .
[ eng.11 ] now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
[ eng.12 ] and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
[ eng.13 ] saying , say ye , his disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
[ eng.14 ] and if this come to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him , and secure you .
[ eng.15 ] so they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day .
[ eng.16 ] then the eleven disciples went away into galilee , into a mountain where jesus had appointed them .
[ eng.17 ] and when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
[ eng.18 ] and jesus came and spake unto them , saying , all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
[ eng.19 ] go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost :
[ eng.20 ] teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you : and , lo , i am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . amen .
[ eng.1 ] the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ , the son of god ;
[ eng.2 ] as it is written in the prophets , behold , i send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
[ eng.3 ] the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
[ eng.4 ] john did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
[ eng.5 ] and there went out unto him all the land of judaea , and they of jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan , confessing their sins .
[ eng.6 ] and john was clothed with camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
[ eng.7 ] and preached , saying , there cometh one mightier than i after me , the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
[ eng.8 ] i indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost .
[ eng.9 ] and it came to pass in those days , that jesus came from nazareth of galilee , and was baptized of john in jordan .
[ eng.10 ] and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the spirit like a dove descending upon him :
[ eng.11 ] and there came a voice from heaven , saying , thou art my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
[ eng.12 ] and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
[ eng.13 ] and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
[ eng.14 ] now after that john was put in prison , jesus came into galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god ,
[ eng.15 ] and saying , the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
[ eng.16 ] now as he walked by the sea of galilee , he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
[ eng.17 ] and jesus said unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you to become fishers of men .
[ eng.18 ] and straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
[ eng.19 ] and when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
[ eng.20 ] and straightway he called them : and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
[ eng.21 ] and they went into capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
[ eng.22 ] and they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
[ eng.23 ] and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
[ eng.24 ] saying , let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou art , the holy one of god .
[ eng.25 ] and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him .
[ eng.26 ] and when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
[ eng.27 ] and they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , what thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
[ eng.28 ] and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee .
[ eng.29 ] and forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of simon and andrew , with james and john .
[ eng.30 ] but simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
[ eng.31 ] and he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
[ eng.32 ] and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
[ eng.33 ] and all the city was gathered together at the door .
[ eng.34 ] and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
[ eng.35 ] and in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
[ eng.36 ] and simon and they that were with him followed after him .
[ eng.37 ] and when they had found him , they said unto him , all men seek for thee .
[ eng.38 ] and he said unto them , let us go into the next towns , that i may preach there also : for therefore came i forth .
[ eng.39 ] and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee , and cast out devils .
[ eng.40 ] and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
[ eng.41 ] and jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , i will ; be thou clean .
[ eng.42 ] and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
[ eng.43 ] and he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
[ eng.44 ] and saith unto him , see thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
[ eng.45 ] but he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
[ eng.1 ] and again he entered into capernaum after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
[ eng.2 ] and straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
[ eng.3 ] and they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
[ eng.4 ] and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
[ eng.5 ] when jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
[ eng.6 ] but there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
[ eng.7 ] why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but god only ?
[ eng.8 ] and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
[ eng.9 ] whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ?
[ eng.10 ] but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , )
[ eng.11 ] i say unto thee , arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
[ eng.12 ] and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified god , saying , we never saw it on this fashion .
[ eng.13 ] and he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
[ eng.14 ] and as he passed by , he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , follow me . and he arose and followed him .
[ eng.15 ] and it came to pass , that , as jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
[ eng.16 ] and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
[ eng.17 ] when jesus heard it , he saith unto them , they that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : i came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
[ eng.18 ] and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
[ eng.19 ] and jesus said unto them , can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
[ eng.20 ] but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
[ eng.21 ] no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
[ eng.22 ] and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
[ eng.23 ] and it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
[ eng.24 ] and the pharisees said unto him , behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
[ eng.25 ] and he said unto them , have ye never read what david did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
[ eng.26 ] how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
[ eng.27 ] and he said unto them , the sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
[ eng.28 ] therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
[ eng.1 ] and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
[ eng.2 ] and they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
[ eng.3 ] and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , stand forth .
[ eng.4 ] and he saith unto them , is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
[ eng.5 ] and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
[ eng.6 ] and the pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
[ eng.7 ] but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from galilee followed him , and from judaea ,
[ eng.8 ] and from jerusalem , and from idumaea , and from beyond jordan ; and they about tyre and sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
[ eng.9 ] and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
[ eng.10 ] for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
[ eng.11 ] and unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , thou art the son of god .
[ eng.12 ] and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
[ eng.13 ] and he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
[ eng.14 ] and he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
[ eng.15 ] and to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
[ eng.16 ] and simon he surnamed peter ;
[ eng.17 ] and james the son of zebedee , and john the brother of james ; and he surnamed them boanerges , which is , the sons of thunder :
[ eng.18 ] and andrew , and philip , and bartholomew , and matthew , and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus , and simon the canaanite ,
[ eng.19 ] and judas iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
[ eng.20 ] and the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
[ eng.21 ] and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , he is beside himself .
[ eng.22 ] and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said , he hath beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .
[ eng.23 ] and he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , how can satan cast out satan ?
[ eng.24 ] and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
[ eng.25 ] and if a house be divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
[ eng.26 ] and if satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
[ eng.27 ] no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
[ eng.28 ] verily i say unto you , all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
[ eng.29 ] but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation .
[ eng.30 ] because they said , he hath an unclean spirit .
[ eng.31 ] there came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
[ eng.32 ] and the multitude sat about him , and they said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
[ eng.33 ] and he answered them , saying , who is my mother , or my brethren ?
[ eng.34 ] and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , behold my mother and my brethren !
[ eng.35 ] for whosoever shall do the will of god , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .
[ eng.1 ] and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
[ eng.2 ] and he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
[ eng.3 ] hearken ; behold , there went out a sower to sow :
[ eng.4 ] and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
[ eng.5 ] and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
[ eng.6 ] but when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
[ eng.7 ] and some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
[ eng.8 ] and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
[ eng.9 ] and he said unto them , he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.10 ] and when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
[ eng.11 ] and he said unto them , unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
[ eng.12 ] that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
[ eng.13 ] and he said unto them , know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
[ eng.14 ] the sower soweth the word .
[ eng.15 ] and these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
[ eng.16 ] and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
[ eng.17 ] and have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
[ eng.18 ] and these are they which are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word ,
[ eng.19 ] and the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
[ eng.20 ] and these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
[ eng.21 ] and he said unto them , is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
[ eng.22 ] for there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
[ eng.23 ] if any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.24 ] and he said unto them , take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
[ eng.25 ] for he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
[ eng.26 ] and he said , so is the kingdom of god , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
[ eng.27 ] and should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
[ eng.28 ] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
[ eng.29 ] but when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
[ eng.30 ] and he said , whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
[ eng.31 ] it is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth :
[ eng.32 ] but when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
[ eng.33 ] and with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
[ eng.34 ] but without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
[ eng.35 ] and the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , let us pass over unto the other side .
[ eng.36 ] and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
[ eng.37 ] and there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
[ eng.38 ] and he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , master , carest thou not that we perish ?
[ eng.39 ] and he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , peace , be still . and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
[ eng.40 ] and he said unto them , why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
[ eng.41 ] and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , what manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
[ eng.1 ] and they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the gadarenes .
[ eng.2 ] and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
[ eng.3 ] who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
[ eng.4 ] because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
[ eng.5 ] and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
[ eng.6 ] but when he saw jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
[ eng.7 ] and cried with a loud voice , and said , what have i to do with thee , jesus , thou son of the most high god ? i adjure thee by god , that thou torment me not .
[ eng.8 ] for he said unto him , come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
[ eng.9 ] and he asked him , what is thy name ? and he answered , saying , my name is legion : for we are many .
[ eng.10 ] and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
[ eng.11 ] now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
[ eng.12 ] and all the devils besought him , saying , send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
[ eng.13 ] and forthwith jesus gave them leave . and the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
[ eng.14 ] and they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
[ eng.15 ] and they come to jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
[ eng.16 ] and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
[ eng.17 ] and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
[ eng.18 ] and when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
[ eng.19 ] howbeit jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
[ eng.20 ] and he departed , and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
[ eng.21 ] and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
[ eng.22 ] and , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
[ eng.23 ] and besought him greatly , saying , my little daughter lieth at the point of death : i pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
[ eng.24 ] and jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
[ eng.25 ] and a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
[ eng.26 ] and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
[ eng.27 ] when she had heard of jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
[ eng.28 ] for she said , if i may touch but his clothes , i shall be whole .
[ eng.29 ] and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
[ eng.30 ] and jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , who touched my clothes ?
[ eng.31 ] and his disciples said unto him , thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
[ eng.32 ] and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
[ eng.33 ] but the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
[ eng.34 ] and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
[ eng.35 ] while he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said , thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the master any further ?
[ eng.36 ] as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , be not afraid , only believe .
[ eng.37 ] and he suffered no man to follow him , save peter , and james , and john the brother of james .
[ eng.38 ] and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
[ eng.39 ] and when he was come in , he saith unto them , why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth .
[ eng.40 ] and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
[ eng.41 ] and he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , damsel , i say unto thee , arise .
[ eng.42 ] and straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
[ eng.43 ] and he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
[ eng.1 ] and he went out from thence , and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
[ eng.2 ] and when the sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , from whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
[ eng.3 ] is not this the carpenter , the son of mary , the brother of james , and joses , and of juda , and simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
[ eng.4 ] but jesus , said unto them , a prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
[ eng.5 ] and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
[ eng.6 ] and he marvelled because of their unbelief . and he went round about the villages , teaching .
[ eng.7 ] and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
[ eng.8 ] and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
[ eng.9 ] but be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
[ eng.10 ] and he said unto them , in what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
[ eng.11 ] and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
[ eng.12 ] and they went out , and preached that men should repent .
[ eng.13 ] and they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
[ eng.14 ] and king herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , that john the baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
[ eng.15 ] others said , that it is elias . and others said , that it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
[ eng.16 ] but when herod heard thereof , he said , it is john , whom i beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
[ eng.17 ] for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john , and bound him in prison for herodias ' sake , his brother philip 's wife : for he had married her .
[ eng.18 ] for john had said unto herod , it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife .
[ eng.19 ] therefore herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
[ eng.20 ] for herod feared john , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
[ eng.21 ] and when a convenient day was come , that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of galilee ;
[ eng.22 ] and when the daughter of the said herodias came in , and danced , and pleased herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and i will give it thee .
[ eng.23 ] and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , i will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
[ eng.24 ] and she went forth , and said unto her mother , what shall i ask ? and she said , the head of john the baptist .
[ eng.25 ] and she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist .
[ eng.26 ] and the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
[ eng.27 ] and immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
[ eng.28 ] and brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
[ eng.29 ] and when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
[ eng.30 ] and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
[ eng.31 ] and he said unto them , come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
[ eng.32 ] and they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
[ eng.33 ] and the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
[ eng.34 ] and jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
[ eng.35 ] and when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , this is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
[ eng.36 ] send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
[ eng.37 ] he answered and said unto them , give ye them to eat . and they say unto him , shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
[ eng.38 ] he saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? go and see . and when they knew , they say , five , and two fishes .
[ eng.39 ] and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
[ eng.40 ] and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
[ eng.41 ] and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
[ eng.42 ] and they did all eat , and were filled .
[ eng.43 ] and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
[ eng.44 ] and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
[ eng.45 ] and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
[ eng.46 ] and when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
[ eng.47 ] and when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
[ eng.48 ] and he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
[ eng.49 ] but when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
[ eng.50 ] for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , be of good cheer : it is i ; be not afraid .
[ eng.51 ] and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
[ eng.52 ] for they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
[ eng.53 ] and when they had passed over , they came into the land of gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
[ eng.54 ] and when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
[ eng.55 ] and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
[ eng.56 ] and whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
[ eng.1 ] then came together unto him the pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from jerusalem .
[ eng.2 ] and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
[ eng.3 ] for the pharisees , and all the jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
[ eng.4 ] and when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . and many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
[ eng.5 ] then the pharisees and scribes asked him , why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
[ eng.6 ] he answered and said unto them , well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , this people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
[ eng.7 ] howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
[ eng.8 ] for laying aside the commandment of god , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
[ eng.9 ] and he said unto them , full well ye reject the commandment of god , that ye may keep your own tradition .
[ eng.10 ] for moses said , honour thy father and thy mother ; and , whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
[ eng.11 ] but ye say , if a man shall say to his father or mother , it is corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
[ eng.12 ] and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
[ eng.13 ] making the word of god of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
[ eng.14 ] and when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
[ eng.15 ] there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
[ eng.16 ] if any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.17 ] and when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
[ eng.18 ] and he saith unto them , are ye so without understanding also ? do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it cannot defile him ;
[ eng.19 ] because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
[ eng.20 ] and he said , that which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
[ eng.21 ] for from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
[ eng.22 ] thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
[ eng.23 ] all these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
[ eng.24 ] and from thence he arose , and went into the borders of tyre and sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
[ eng.25 ] for a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
[ eng.26 ] the woman was a greek , a syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
[ eng.27 ] but jesus said unto her , let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it unto the dogs .
[ eng.28 ] and she answered and said unto him , yes , lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs .
[ eng.29 ] and he said unto her , for this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
[ eng.30 ] and when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
[ eng.31 ] and again , departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon , he came unto the sea of galilee , through the midst of the coasts of decapolis .
[ eng.32 ] and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
[ eng.33 ] and he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
[ eng.34 ] and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , ephphatha , that is , be opened .
[ eng.35 ] and straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
[ eng.36 ] and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
[ eng.37 ] and were beyond measure astonished , saying , he hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
[ eng.1 ] in those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them ,
[ eng.2 ] i have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
[ eng.3 ] and if i send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
[ eng.4 ] and his disciples answered him , from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
[ eng.5 ] and he asked them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven .
[ eng.6 ] and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
[ eng.7 ] and they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
[ eng.8 ] so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
[ eng.9 ] and they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
[ eng.10 ] and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of dalmanutha .
[ eng.11 ] and the pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
[ eng.12 ] and he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily i say unto you , there shall no sign be given unto this generation .
[ eng.13 ] and he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
[ eng.14 ] now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
[ eng.15 ] and he charged them , saying , take heed , beware of the leaven of the pharisees , and of the leaven of herod .
[ eng.16 ] and they reasoned among themselves , saying , it is because we have no bread .
[ eng.17 ] and when jesus knew it , he saith unto them , why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
[ eng.18 ] having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
[ eng.19 ] when i brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? they say unto him , twelve .
[ eng.20 ] and when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? and they said , seven .
[ eng.21 ] and he said unto them , how is it that ye do not understand ?
[ eng.22 ] and he cometh to bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
[ eng.23 ] and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
[ eng.24 ] and he looked up , and said , i see men as trees , walking .
[ eng.25 ] after that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
[ eng.26 ] and he sent him away to his house , saying , neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
[ eng.27 ] and jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of caesarea philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , whom do men say that i am ?
[ eng.28 ] and they answered , john the baptist ; but some say , elias ; and others , one of the prophets .
[ eng.29 ] and he saith unto them , but whom say ye that i am ? and peter answereth and saith unto him , thou art the christ .
[ eng.30 ] and he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
[ eng.31 ] and he began to teach them , that the son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
[ eng.32 ] and he spake that saying openly . and peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
[ eng.33 ] but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked peter , saying , get thee behind me , satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of god , but the things that be of men .
[ eng.34 ] and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
[ eng.35 ] for whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
[ eng.36 ] for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
[ eng.37 ] or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
[ eng.38 ] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels .
[ eng.1 ] and he said unto them , verily i say unto you , that there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power .
[ eng.2 ] and after six days jesus taketh with him peter , and james , and john , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
[ eng.3 ] and his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
[ eng.4 ] and there appeared unto them elias with moses : and they were talking with jesus .
[ eng.5 ] and peter answered and said to jesus , master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias .
[ eng.6 ] for he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
[ eng.7 ] and there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , this is my beloved son : hear him .
[ eng.8 ] and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save jesus only with themselves .
[ eng.9 ] and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the son of man were risen from the dead .
[ eng.10 ] and they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
[ eng.11 ] and they asked him , saying , why say the scribes that elias must first come ?
[ eng.12 ] and he answered and told them , elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
[ eng.13 ] but i say unto you , that elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
[ eng.14 ] and when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
[ eng.15 ] and straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
[ eng.16 ] and he asked the scribes , what question ye with them ?
[ eng.17 ] and one of the multitude answered and said , master , i have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ;
[ eng.18 ] and wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
[ eng.19 ] he answereth him , and saith , o faithless generation , how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him unto me .
[ eng.20 ] and they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
[ eng.21 ] and he asked his father , how long is it ago since this came unto him ? and he said , of a child .
[ eng.22 ] and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
[ eng.23 ] jesus said unto him , if thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
[ eng.24 ] and straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , lord , i believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
[ eng.25 ] when jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , thou dumb and deaf spirit , i charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
[ eng.26 ] and the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , he is dead .
[ eng.27 ] but jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
[ eng.28 ] and when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , why could not we cast him out ?
[ eng.29 ] and he said unto them , this kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
[ eng.30 ] and they departed thence , and passed through galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
[ eng.31 ] for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , the son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
[ eng.32 ] but they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
[ eng.33 ] and he came to capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
[ eng.34 ] but they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
[ eng.35 ] and he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , if any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
[ eng.36 ] and he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
[ eng.37 ] whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
[ eng.38 ] and john answered him , saying , master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
[ eng.39 ] but jesus said , forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
[ eng.40 ] for he that is not against us is on our part .
[ eng.41 ] for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to christ , verily i say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
[ eng.42 ] and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
[ eng.43 ] and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
[ eng.44 ] where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
[ eng.45 ] and if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
[ eng.46 ] where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
[ eng.47 ] and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
[ eng.48 ] where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
[ eng.49 ] for every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
[ eng.50 ] salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
[ eng.1 ] and he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
[ eng.2 ] and the pharisees came to him , and asked him , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
[ eng.3 ] and he answered and said unto them , what did moses command you ?
[ eng.4 ] and they said , moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
[ eng.5 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
[ eng.6 ] but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female .
[ eng.7 ] for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
[ eng.8 ] and they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
[ eng.9 ] what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
[ eng.10 ] and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
[ eng.11 ] and he saith unto them , whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
[ eng.12 ] and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
[ eng.13 ] and they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
[ eng.14 ] but when jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
[ eng.15 ] verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
[ eng.16 ] and he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
[ eng.17 ] and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , good master , what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life ?
[ eng.18 ] and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , god .
[ eng.19 ] thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , defraud not , honour thy father and mother .
[ eng.20 ] and he answered and said unto him , master , all these have i observed from my youth .
[ eng.21 ] then jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , one thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
[ eng.22 ] and he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
[ eng.23 ] and jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
[ eng.24 ] and the disciples were astonished at his words . but jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god !
[ eng.25 ] it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
[ eng.26 ] and they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , who then can be saved ?
[ eng.27 ] and jesus looking upon them saith , with men it is impossible , but not with god : for with god all things are possible .
[ eng.28 ] then peter began to say unto him , lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
[ eng.29 ] and jesus answered and said , verily i say unto you , there is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel 's ,
[ eng.30 ] but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
[ eng.31 ] but many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
[ eng.32 ] and they were in the way going up to jerusalem ; and jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . and he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
[ eng.33 ] saying , behold , we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the gentiles :
[ eng.34 ] and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
[ eng.35 ] and james and john , the sons of zebedee , come unto him , saying , master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
[ eng.36 ] and he said unto them , what would ye that i should do for you ?
[ eng.37 ] they said unto him , grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
[ eng.38 ] but jesus said unto them , ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that i drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ?
[ eng.39 ] and they said unto him , we can . and jesus said unto them , ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of ; and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
[ eng.40 ] but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
[ eng.41 ] and when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with james and john .
[ eng.42 ] but jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
[ eng.43 ] but so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
[ eng.44 ] and whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
[ eng.45 ] for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
[ eng.46 ] and they came to jericho : and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind bartimaeus , the son of timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
[ eng.47 ] and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
[ eng.48 ] and many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
[ eng.49 ] and jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . and they call the blind man , saying unto him , be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
[ eng.50 ] and he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to jesus .
[ eng.51 ] and jesus answered and said unto him , what wilt thou that i should do unto thee ? the blind man said unto him , lord , that i might receive my sight .
[ eng.52 ] and jesus said unto him , go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight , and followed jesus in the way .
[ eng.1 ] and when they came nigh to jerusalem , unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount of olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
[ eng.2 ] and saith unto them , go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
[ eng.3 ] and if any man say unto you , why do ye this ? say ye that the lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
[ eng.4 ] and they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
[ eng.5 ] and certain of them that stood there said unto them , what do ye , loosing the colt ?
[ eng.6 ] and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
[ eng.7 ] and they brought the colt to jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
[ eng.8 ] and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
[ eng.9 ] and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord :
[ eng.10 ] blessed be the kingdom of our father david , that cometh in the name of the lord : hosanna in the highest .
[ eng.11 ] and jesus entered into jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto bethany with the twelve .
[ eng.12 ] and on the morrow , when they were come from bethany , he was hungry :
[ eng.13 ] and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
[ eng.14 ] and jesus answered and said unto it , no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . and his disciples heard it .
[ eng.15 ] and they come to jerusalem : and jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
[ eng.16 ] and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
[ eng.17 ] and he taught , saying unto them , is it not written , my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
[ eng.18 ] and the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
[ eng.19 ] and when even was come , he went out of the city .
[ eng.20 ] and in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
[ eng.21 ] and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
[ eng.22 ] and jesus answering saith unto them , have faith in god .
[ eng.23 ] for verily i say unto you , that whosoever shall say unto this mountain , be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
[ eng.24 ] therefore i say unto you , what things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
[ eng.25 ] and when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
[ eng.26 ] but if ye do not forgive , neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses .
[ eng.27 ] and they come again to jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
[ eng.28 ] and say unto him , by what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
[ eng.29 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , i will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and i will tell you by what authority i do these things .
[ eng.30 ] the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
[ eng.31 ] and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then did ye not believe him ?
[ eng.32 ] but if we shall say , of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted john , that he was a prophet indeed .
[ eng.33 ] and they answered and said unto jesus , we cannot tell . and jesus answering saith unto them , neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things .
[ eng.1 ] and he began to speak unto them by parables . a certain man planted a vineyard , and set an hedge about it , and digged a place for the winefat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country .
[ eng.2 ] and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
[ eng.3 ] and they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
[ eng.4 ] and again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
[ eng.5 ] and again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
[ eng.6 ] having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , they will reverence my son .
[ eng.7 ] but those husbandmen said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be our 's .
[ eng.8 ] and they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
[ eng.9 ] what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
[ eng.10 ] and have ye not read this scripture ; the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner :
[ eng.11 ] this was the lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
[ eng.12 ] and they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
[ eng.13 ] and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians , to catch him in his words .
[ eng.14 ] and when they were come , they say unto him , master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of god in truth : is it lawful to give tribute to caesar , or not ?
[ eng.15 ] shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that i may see it .
[ eng.16 ] and they brought it . and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , caesar 's .
[ eng.17 ] and jesus answering said unto them , render to caesar the things that are caesar 's , and to god the things that are god 's . and they marvelled at him .
[ eng.18 ] then come unto him the sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
[ eng.19 ] master , moses wrote unto us , if a man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
[ eng.20 ] now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
[ eng.21 ] and the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
[ eng.22 ] and the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
[ eng.23 ] in the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
[ eng.24 ] and jesus answering said unto them , do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of god ?
[ eng.25 ] for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
[ eng.26 ] and as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of moses , how in the bush god spake unto him , saying , i am the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob ?
[ eng.27 ] he is not the god of the dead , but the god of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
[ eng.28 ] and one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , which is the first commandment of all ?
[ eng.29 ] and jesus answered him , the first of all the commandments is , hear , o israel ; the lord our god is one lord :
[ eng.30 ] and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
[ eng.31 ] and the second is like , namely this , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
[ eng.32 ] and the scribe said unto him , well , master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one god ; and there is none other but he :
[ eng.33 ] and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
[ eng.34 ] and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , thou art not far from the kingdom of god . and no man after that durst ask him any question .
[ eng.35 ] and jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , how say the scribes that christ is the son of david ?
[ eng.36 ] for david himself said by the holy ghost , the lord said to my lord , sit thou on my right hand , till i make thine enemies thy footstool .
[ eng.37 ] david therefore himself calleth him lord ; and whence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .
[ eng.38 ] and he said unto them in his doctrine , beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
[ eng.39 ] and the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
[ eng.40 ] which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
[ eng.41 ] and jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
[ eng.42 ] and there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
[ eng.43 ] and he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , verily i say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
[ eng.44 ] for all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
[ eng.1 ] and as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
[ eng.2 ] and jesus answering said unto him , seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
[ eng.3 ] and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple , peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately ,
[ eng.4 ] tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
[ eng.5 ] and jesus answering them began to say , take heed lest any man deceive you :
[ eng.6 ] for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and shall deceive many .
[ eng.7 ] and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
[ eng.8 ] for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
[ eng.9 ] but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
[ eng.10 ] and the gospel must first be published among all nations .
[ eng.11 ] but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the holy ghost .
[ eng.12 ] now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
[ eng.13 ] and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
[ eng.14 ] but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains :
[ eng.15 ] and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
[ eng.16 ] and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
[ eng.17 ] but woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
[ eng.18 ] and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
[ eng.19 ] for in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time , neither shall be .
[ eng.20 ] and except that the lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
[ eng.21 ] and then if any man shall say to you , lo , here is christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
[ eng.22 ] for false christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
[ eng.23 ] but take ye heed : behold , i have foretold you all things .
[ eng.24 ] but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
[ eng.25 ] and the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
[ eng.26 ] and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
[ eng.27 ] and then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
[ eng.28 ] now learn a parable of the fig tree ; when her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
[ eng.29 ] so ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
[ eng.30 ] verily i say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
[ eng.31 ] heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
[ eng.32 ] but of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the son , but the father .
[ eng.33 ] take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
[ eng.34 ] for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
[ eng.35 ] watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
[ eng.36 ] lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
[ eng.37 ] and what i say unto you i say unto all , watch .
[ eng.1 ] after two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
[ eng.2 ] but they said , not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
[ eng.3 ] and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
[ eng.4 ] and there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , why was this waste of the ointment made ?
[ eng.5 ] for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
[ eng.6 ] and jesus said , let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
[ eng.7 ] for ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
[ eng.8 ] she hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
[ eng.9 ] verily i say unto you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
[ eng.10 ] and judas iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
[ eng.11 ] and when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
[ eng.12 ] and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
[ eng.13 ] and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
[ eng.14 ] and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , the master saith , where is the guestchamber , where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
[ eng.15 ] and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
[ eng.16 ] and his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
[ eng.17 ] and in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
[ eng.18 ] and as they sat and did eat , jesus said , verily i say unto you , one of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
[ eng.19 ] and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , is it i ? and another said , is it i ?
[ eng.20 ] and he answered and said unto them , it is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
[ eng.21 ] the son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
[ eng.22 ] and as they did eat , jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , take , eat : this is my body .
[ eng.23 ] and he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
[ eng.24 ] and he said unto them , this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
[ eng.25 ] verily i say unto you , i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god .
[ eng.26 ] and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
[ eng.27 ] and jesus saith unto them , all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , i will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
[ eng.28 ] but after that i am risen , i will go before you into galilee .
[ eng.29 ] but peter said unto him , although all shall be offended , yet will not i .
[ eng.30 ] and jesus saith unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
[ eng.31 ] but he spake the more vehemently , if i should die with thee , i will not deny thee in any wise . likewise also said they all .
[ eng.32 ] and they came to a place which was named gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , sit ye here , while i shall pray .
[ eng.33 ] and he taketh with him peter and james and john , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
[ eng.34 ] and saith unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
[ eng.35 ] and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
[ eng.36 ] and he said , abba , father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what i will , but what thou wilt .
[ eng.37 ] and he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
[ eng.38 ] watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
[ eng.39 ] and again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
[ eng.40 ] and when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
[ eng.41 ] and he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
[ eng.42 ] rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
[ eng.43 ] and immediately , while he yet spake , cometh judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
[ eng.44 ] and he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
[ eng.45 ] and as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , master , master ; and kissed him .
[ eng.46 ] and they laid their hands on him , and took him .
[ eng.47 ] and one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
[ eng.48 ] and jesus answered and said unto them , are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
[ eng.49 ] i was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
[ eng.50 ] and they all forsook him , and fled .
[ eng.51 ] and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
[ eng.52 ] and he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
[ eng.53 ] and they led jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
[ eng.54 ] and peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
[ eng.55 ] and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
[ eng.56 ] for many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
[ eng.57 ] and there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
[ eng.58 ] we heard him say , i will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days i will build another made without hands .
[ eng.59 ] but neither so did their witness agree together .
[ eng.60 ] and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked jesus , saying , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
[ eng.61 ] but he held his peace , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , art thou the christ , the son of the blessed ?
[ eng.62 ] and jesus said , i am : and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
[ eng.63 ] then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , what need we any further witnesses ?
[ eng.64 ] ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
[ eng.65 ] and some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
[ eng.66 ] and as peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
[ eng.67 ] and when she saw peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth .
[ eng.68 ] but he denied , saying , i know not , neither understand i what thou sayest . and he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
[ eng.69 ] and a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , this is one of them .
[ eng.70 ] and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to peter , surely thou art one of them : for thou art a galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
[ eng.71 ] but he began to curse and to swear , saying , i know not this man of whom ye speak .
[ eng.72 ] and the second time the cock crew . and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
[ eng.1 ] and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to pilate .
[ eng.2 ] and pilate asked him , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answering said unto them , thou sayest it .
[ eng.3 ] and the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
[ eng.4 ] and pilate asked him again , saying , answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
[ eng.5 ] but jesus yet answered nothing ; so that pilate marvelled .
[ eng.6 ] now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
[ eng.7 ] and there was one named barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
[ eng.8 ] and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
[ eng.9 ] but pilate answered them , saying , will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
[ eng.10 ] for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
[ eng.11 ] but the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release barabbas unto them .
[ eng.12 ] and pilate answered and said again unto them , what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews ?
[ eng.13 ] and they cried out again , crucify him .
[ eng.14 ] then pilate said unto them , why , what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more exceedingly , crucify him .
[ eng.15 ] and so pilate , willing to content the people , released barabbas unto them , and delivered jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
[ eng.16 ] and the soldiers led him away into the hall , called praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
[ eng.17 ] and they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
[ eng.18 ] and began to salute him , hail , king of the jews !
[ eng.19 ] and they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
[ eng.20 ] and when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
[ eng.21 ] and they compel one simon a cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of alexander and rufus , to bear his cross .
[ eng.22 ] and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , the place of a skull .
[ eng.23 ] and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
[ eng.24 ] and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
[ eng.25 ] and it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
[ eng.26 ] and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the king of the jews .
[ eng.27 ] and with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
[ eng.28 ] and the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , and he was numbered with the transgressors .
[ eng.29 ] and they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days ,
[ eng.30 ] save thyself , and come down from the cross .
[ eng.31 ] likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , he saved others ; himself he cannot save .
[ eng.32 ] let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . and they that were crucified with him reviled him .
[ eng.33 ] and when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
[ eng.34 ] and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , eloi , eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ?
[ eng.35 ] and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , behold , he calleth elias .
[ eng.36 ] and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , let alone ; let us see whether elias will come to take him down .
[ eng.37 ] and jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
[ eng.38 ] and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
[ eng.39 ] and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , truly this man was the son of god .
[ eng.40 ] there were also women looking on afar off : among whom was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james the less and of joses , and salome ;
[ eng.41 ] ( who also , when he was in galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem .
[ eng.42 ] and now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
[ eng.43 ] joseph of arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of god , came , and went in boldly unto pilate , and craved the body of jesus .
[ eng.44 ] and pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
[ eng.45 ] and when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to joseph .
[ eng.46 ] and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
[ eng.47 ] and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid .
[ eng.1 ] and when the sabbath was past , mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james , and salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
[ eng.2 ] and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
[ eng.3 ] and they said among themselves , who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
[ eng.4 ] and when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
[ eng.5 ] and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
[ eng.6 ] and he saith unto them , be not affrighted : ye seek jesus of nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
[ eng.7 ] but go your way , tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
[ eng.8 ] and they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
[ eng.9 ] now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to mary magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
[ eng.10 ] and she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
[ eng.11 ] and they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
[ eng.12 ] after that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
[ eng.13 ] and they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
[ eng.14 ] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
[ eng.15 ] and he said unto them , go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
[ eng.16 ] he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
[ eng.17 ] and these signs shall follow them that believe ; in my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
[ eng.18 ] they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
[ eng.19 ] so then after the lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of god .
[ eng.20 ] and they went forth , and preached every where , the lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . amen .
[ eng.1 ] forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
[ eng.2 ] even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
[ eng.3 ] it seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent theophilus ,
[ eng.4 ] that thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
[ eng.5 ] there was in the days of herod , the king of judaea , a certain priest named zacharias , of the course of abia : and his wife was of the daughters of aaron , and her name was elisabeth .
[ eng.6 ] and they were both righteous before god , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless .
[ eng.7 ] and they had no child , because that elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
[ eng.8 ] and it came to pass , that while he executed the priest 's office before god in the order of his course ,
[ eng.9 ] according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord .
[ eng.10 ] and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
[ eng.11 ] and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
[ eng.12 ] and when zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
[ eng.13 ] but the angel said unto him , fear not , zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name john .
[ eng.14 ] and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
[ eng.15 ] for he shall be great in the sight of the lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the holy ghost , even from his mother 's womb .
[ eng.16 ] and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god .
[ eng.17 ] and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the lord .
[ eng.18 ] and zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall i know this ? for i am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
[ eng.19 ] and the angel answering said unto him , i am gabriel , that stand in the presence of god ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
[ eng.20 ] and , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
[ eng.21 ] and the people waited for zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
[ eng.22 ] and when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
[ eng.23 ] and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
[ eng.24 ] and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
[ eng.25 ] thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
[ eng.26 ] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee , named nazareth ,
[ eng.27 ] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph , of the house of david ; and the virgin 's name was mary .
[ eng.28 ] and the angel came in unto her , and said , hail , thou that art highly favoured , the lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
[ eng.29 ] and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
[ eng.30 ] and the angel said unto her , fear not , mary : for thou hast found favour with god .
[ eng.31 ] and , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name jesus .
[ eng.32 ] he shall be great , and shall be called the son of the highest : and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david :
[ eng.33 ] and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
[ eng.34 ] then said mary unto the angel , how shall this be , seeing i know not a man ?
[ eng.35 ] and the angel answered and said unto her , the holy ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god .
[ eng.36 ] and , behold , thy cousin elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
[ eng.37 ] for with god nothing shall be impossible .
[ eng.38 ] and mary said , behold the handmaid of the lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . and the angel departed from her .
[ eng.39 ] and mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of juda ;
[ eng.40 ] and entered into the house of zacharias , and saluted elisabeth .
[ eng.41 ] and it came to pass , that , when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost :
[ eng.42 ] and she spake out with a loud voice , and said , blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
[ eng.43 ] and whence is this to me , that the mother of my lord should come to me ?
[ eng.44 ] for , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
[ eng.45 ] and blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord .
[ eng.46 ] and mary said , my soul doth magnify the lord ,
[ eng.47 ] and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour .
[ eng.48 ] for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
[ eng.49 ] for he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
[ eng.50 ] and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
[ eng.51 ] he hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
[ eng.52 ] he hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
[ eng.53 ] he hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
[ eng.54 ] he hath holpen his servant israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
[ eng.55 ] as he spake to our fathers , to abraham , and to his seed for ever .
[ eng.56 ] and mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
[ eng.57 ] now elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
[ eng.58 ] and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
[ eng.59 ] and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him zacharias , after the name of his father .
[ eng.60 ] and his mother answered and said , not so ; but he shall be called john .
[ eng.61 ] and they said unto her , there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
[ eng.62 ] and they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
[ eng.63 ] and he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , his name is john . and they marvelled all .
[ eng.64 ] and his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised god .
[ eng.65 ] and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea .
[ eng.66 ] and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , what manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the lord was with him .
[ eng.67 ] and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
[ eng.68 ] blessed be the lord god of israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people ,
[ eng.69 ] and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david ;
[ eng.70 ] as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
[ eng.71 ] that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
[ eng.72 ] to perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
[ eng.73 ] the oath which he sware to our father abraham ,
[ eng.74 ] that he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
[ eng.75 ] in holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
[ eng.76 ] and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways ;
[ eng.77 ] to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
[ eng.78 ] through the tender mercy of our god ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
[ eng.79 ] to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .
[ eng.80 ] and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed .
[ eng.2 ] ( and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria . )
[ eng.3 ] and all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
[ eng.4 ] and joseph also went up from galilee , out of the city of nazareth , into judaea , unto the city of david , which is called bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of david : )
[ eng.5 ] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
[ eng.6 ] and so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
[ eng.7 ] and she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
[ eng.8 ] and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
[ eng.9 ] and , lo , the angel of the lord came upon them , and the glory of the lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
[ eng.10 ] and the angel said unto them , fear not : for , behold , i bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
[ eng.11 ] for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour , which is christ the lord .
[ eng.12 ] and this shall be a sign unto you ; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
[ eng.13 ] and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god , and saying ,
[ eng.14 ] glory to god in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
[ eng.15 ] and it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , let us now go even unto bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the lord hath made known unto us .
[ eng.16 ] and they came with haste , and found mary , and joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
[ eng.17 ] and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
[ eng.18 ] and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
[ eng.19 ] but mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
[ eng.20 ] and the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
[ eng.21 ] and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called jesus , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
[ eng.22 ] and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished , they brought him to jerusalem , to present him to the lord ;
[ eng.23 ] ( as it is written in the law of the lord , every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord ; )
[ eng.24 ] and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord , a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
[ eng.25 ] and , behold , there was a man in jerusalem , whose name was simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of israel : and the holy ghost was upon him .
[ eng.26 ] and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the lord 's christ .
[ eng.27 ] and he came by the spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
[ eng.28 ] then took he him up in his arms , and blessed god , and said ,
[ eng.29 ] lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
[ eng.30 ] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
[ eng.31 ] which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
[ eng.32 ] a light to lighten the gentiles , and the glory of thy people israel .
[ eng.33 ] and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
[ eng.34 ] and simeon blessed them , and said unto mary his mother , behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
[ eng.35 ] ( yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
[ eng.36 ] and there was one anna , a prophetess , the daughter of phanuel , of the tribe of aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
[ eng.37 ] and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served god with fastings and prayers night and day .
[ eng.38 ] and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem .
[ eng.39 ] and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord , they returned into galilee , to their own city nazareth .
[ eng.40 ] and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of god was upon him .
[ eng.41 ] now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
[ eng.42 ] and when he was twelve years old , they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
[ eng.43 ] and when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem ; and joseph and his mother knew not of it .
[ eng.44 ] but they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
[ eng.45 ] and when they found him not , they turned back again to jerusalem , seeking him .
[ eng.46 ] and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
[ eng.47 ] and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
[ eng.48 ] and when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing .
[ eng.49 ] and he said unto them , how is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that i must be about my father 's business ?
[ eng.50 ] and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
[ eng.51 ] and he went down with them , and came to nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
[ eng.52 ] and jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with god and man .
[ eng.1 ] now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar , pontius pilate being governor of judaea , and herod being tetrarch of galilee , and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis , and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene ,
[ eng.2 ] annas and caiaphas being the high priests , the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness .
[ eng.3 ] and he came into all the country about jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
[ eng.4 ] as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet , saying , the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
[ eng.5 ] every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
[ eng.6 ] and all flesh shall see the salvation of god .
[ eng.7 ] then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , o generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
[ eng.8 ] bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you , that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
[ eng.9 ] and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
[ eng.10 ] and the people asked him , saying , what shall we do then ?
[ eng.11 ] he answereth and saith unto them , he that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
[ eng.12 ] then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , master , what shall we do ?
[ eng.13 ] and he said unto them , exact no more than that which is appointed you .
[ eng.14 ] and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , and what shall we do ? and he said unto them , do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
[ eng.15 ] and as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of john , whether he were the christ , or not ;
[ eng.16 ] john answered , saying unto them all , i indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than i cometh , the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire :
[ eng.17 ] whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
[ eng.18 ] and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
[ eng.19 ] but herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for herodias his brother philip 's wife , and for all the evils which herod had done ,
[ eng.20 ] added yet this above all , that he shut up john in prison .
[ eng.21 ] now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
[ eng.22 ] and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , thou art my beloved son ; in thee i am well pleased .
[ eng.23 ] and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of joseph , which was the son of heli ,
[ eng.24 ] which was the son of matthat , which was the son of levi , which was the son of melchi , which was the son of janna , which was the son of joseph ,
[ eng.25 ] which was the son of mattathias , which was the son of amos , which was the son of naum , which was the son of esli , which was the son of nagge ,
[ eng.26 ] which was the son of maath , which was the son of mattathias , which was the son of semei , which was the son of joseph , which was the son of juda ,
[ eng.27 ] which was the son of joanna , which was the son of rhesa , which was the son of zorobabel , which was the son of salathiel , which was the son of neri ,
[ eng.28 ] which was the son of melchi , which was the son of addi , which was the son of cosam , which was the son of elmodam , which was the son of er ,
[ eng.29 ] which was the son of jose , which was the son of eliezer , which was the son of jorim , which was the son of matthat , which was the son of levi ,
[ eng.30 ] which was the son of simeon , which was the son of juda , which was the son of joseph , which was the son of jonan , which was the son of eliakim ,
[ eng.31 ] which was the son of melea , which was the son of menan , which was the son of mattatha , which was the son of nathan , which was the son of david ,
[ eng.32 ] which was the son of jesse , which was the son of obed , which was the son of booz , which was the son of salmon , which was the son of naasson ,
[ eng.33 ] which was the son of aminadab , which was the son of aram , which was the son of esrom , which was the son of phares , which was the son of juda ,
[ eng.34 ] which was the son of jacob , which was the son of isaac , which was the son of abraham , which was the son of thara , which was the son of nachor ,
[ eng.35 ] which was the son of saruch , which was the son of ragau , which was the son of phalec , which was the son of heber , which was the son of sala ,
[ eng.36 ] which was the son of cainan , which was the son of arphaxad , which was the son of sem , which was the son of noe , which was the son of lamech ,
[ eng.37 ] which was the son of mathusala , which was the son of enoch , which was the son of jared , which was the son of maleleel , which was the son of cainan ,
[ eng.38 ] which was the son of enos , which was the son of seth , which was the son of adam , which was the son of god .
[ eng.1 ] and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan , and was led by the spirit into the wilderness ,
[ eng.2 ] being forty days tempted of the devil . and in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
[ eng.3 ] and the devil said unto him , if thou be the son of god , command this stone that it be made bread .
[ eng.4 ] and jesus answered him , saying , it is written , that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of god .
[ eng.5 ] and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
[ eng.6 ] and the devil said unto him , all this power will i give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever i will i give it .
[ eng.7 ] if thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
[ eng.8 ] and jesus answered and said unto him , get thee behind me , satan : for it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .
[ eng.9 ] and he brought him to jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , if thou be the son of god , cast thyself down from hence :
[ eng.10 ] for it is written , he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
[ eng.11 ] and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
[ eng.12 ] and jesus answering said unto him , it is said , thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
[ eng.13 ] and when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
[ eng.14 ] and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
[ eng.15 ] and he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
[ eng.16 ] and he came to nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
[ eng.17 ] and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias . and when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
[ eng.18 ] the spirit of the lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
[ eng.19 ] to preach the acceptable year of the lord .
[ eng.20 ] and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
[ eng.21 ] and he began to say unto them , this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
[ eng.22 ] and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , is not this joseph 's son ?
[ eng.23 ] and he said unto them , ye will surely say unto me this proverb , physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum , do also here in thy country .
[ eng.24 ] and he said , verily i say unto you , no prophet is accepted in his own country .
[ eng.25 ] but i tell you of a truth , many widows were in israel in the days of elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
[ eng.26 ] but unto none of them was elias sent , save unto sarepta , a city of sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
[ eng.27 ] and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving naaman the syrian .
[ eng.28 ] and all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
[ eng.29 ] and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
[ eng.30 ] but he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
[ eng.31 ] and came down to capernaum , a city of galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
[ eng.32 ] and they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
[ eng.33 ] and in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
[ eng.34 ] saying , let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou art ; the holy one of god .
[ eng.35 ] and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him . and when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
[ eng.36 ] and they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , what a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
[ eng.37 ] and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
[ eng.38 ] and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into simon 's house . and simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
[ eng.39 ] and he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
[ eng.40 ] now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
[ eng.41 ] and devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , thou art christ the son of god . and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was christ .
[ eng.42 ] and when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
[ eng.43 ] and he said unto them , i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also : for therefore am i sent .
[ eng.44 ] and he preached in the synagogues of galilee .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god , he stood by the lake of gennesaret ,
[ eng.2 ] and saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
[ eng.3 ] and he entered into one of the ships , which was simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . and he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
[ eng.4 ] now when he had left speaking , he said unto simon , launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
[ eng.5 ] and simon answering said unto him , master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net .
[ eng.6 ] and when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
[ eng.7 ] and they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
[ eng.8 ] when simon peter saw it , he fell down at jesus ' knees , saying , depart from me ; for i am a sinful man , o lord .
[ eng.9 ] for he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
[ eng.10 ] and so was also james , and john , the sons of zebedee , which were partners with simon . and jesus said unto simon , fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
[ eng.11 ] and when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
[ eng.12 ] and it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
[ eng.13 ] and he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will : be thou clean . and immediately the leprosy departed from him .
[ eng.14 ] and he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
[ eng.15 ] but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
[ eng.16 ] and he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
[ eng.17 ] and it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of galilee , and judaea , and jerusalem : and the power of the lord was present to heal them .
[ eng.18 ] and , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
[ eng.19 ] and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus .
[ eng.20 ] and when he saw their faith , he said unto him , man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
[ eng.21 ] and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason , saying , who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but god alone ?
[ eng.22 ] but when jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , what reason ye in your hearts ?
[ eng.23 ] whether is easier , to say , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , rise up and walk ?
[ eng.24 ] but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) i say unto thee , arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
[ eng.25 ] and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying god .
[ eng.26 ] and they were all amazed , and they glorified god , and were filled with fear , saying , we have seen strange things to day .
[ eng.27 ] and after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , follow me .
[ eng.28 ] and he left all , rose up , and followed him .
[ eng.29 ] and levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
[ eng.30 ] but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
[ eng.31 ] and jesus answering said unto them , they that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
[ eng.32 ] i came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
[ eng.33 ] and they said unto him , why do the disciples of john fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
[ eng.34 ] and he said unto them , can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
[ eng.35 ] but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
[ eng.36 ] and he spake also a parable unto them ; no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
[ eng.37 ] and no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
[ eng.38 ] but new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
[ eng.39 ] no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , the old is better .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
[ eng.2 ] and certain of the pharisees said unto them , why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
[ eng.3 ] and jesus answering them said , have ye not read so much as this , what david did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
[ eng.4 ] how he went into the house of god , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
[ eng.5 ] and he said unto them , that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
[ eng.6 ] and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
[ eng.7 ] and the scribes and pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
[ eng.8 ] but he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , rise up , and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
[ eng.9 ] then said jesus unto them , i will ask you one thing ; is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
[ eng.10 ] and looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , stretch forth thy hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
[ eng.11 ] and they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to jesus .
[ eng.12 ] and it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to god .
[ eng.13 ] and when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
[ eng.14 ] simon , ( whom he also named peter , ) and andrew his brother , james and john , philip and bartholomew ,
[ eng.15 ] matthew and thomas , james the son of alphaeus , and simon called zelotes ,
[ eng.16 ] and judas the brother of james , and judas iscariot , which also was the traitor .
[ eng.17 ] and he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem , and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
[ eng.18 ] and they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
[ eng.19 ] and the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
[ eng.20 ] and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of god .
[ eng.21 ] blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
[ eng.22 ] blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the son of man 's sake .
[ eng.23 ] rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
[ eng.24 ] but woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
[ eng.25 ] woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
[ eng.26 ] woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
[ eng.27 ] but i say unto you which hear , love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
[ eng.28 ] bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
[ eng.29 ] and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also .
[ eng.30 ] give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
[ eng.31 ] and as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
[ eng.32 ] for if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
[ eng.33 ] and if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
[ eng.34 ] and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
[ eng.35 ] but love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
[ eng.36 ] be ye therefore merciful , as your father also is merciful .
[ eng.37 ] judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
[ eng.38 ] give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
[ eng.39 ] and he spake a parable unto them , can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
[ eng.40 ] the disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
[ eng.41 ] and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
[ eng.42 ] either how canst thou say to thy brother , brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye .
[ eng.43 ] for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
[ eng.44 ] for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
[ eng.45 ] a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
[ eng.46 ] and why call ye me , lord , lord , and do not the things which i say ?
[ eng.47 ] whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , i will shew you to whom he is like :
[ eng.48 ] he is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
[ eng.49 ] but he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
[ eng.1 ] now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into capernaum .
[ eng.2 ] and a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
[ eng.3 ] and when he heard of jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
[ eng.4 ] and when they came to jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , that he was worthy for whom he should do this :
[ eng.5 ] for he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue .
[ eng.6 ] then jesus went with them . and when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , lord , trouble not thyself : for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
[ eng.7 ] wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
[ eng.8 ] for i also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and i say unto one , go , and he goeth ; and to another , come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , do this , and he doeth it .
[ eng.9 ] when jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , i say unto you , i have not found so great faith , no , not in israel .
[ eng.10 ] and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
[ eng.11 ] and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
[ eng.12 ] now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
[ eng.13 ] and when the lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , weep not .
[ eng.14 ] and he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . and he said , young man , i say unto thee , arise .
[ eng.15 ] and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he delivered him to his mother .
[ eng.16 ] and there came a fear on all : and they glorified god , saying , that a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , that god hath visited his people .
[ eng.17 ] and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
[ eng.18 ] and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things .
[ eng.19 ] and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus , saying , art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
[ eng.20 ] when the men were come unto him , they said , john baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
[ eng.21 ] and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
[ eng.22 ] then jesus answering said unto them , go your way , and tell john what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
[ eng.23 ] and blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
[ eng.24 ] and when the messengers of john were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning john , what went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
[ eng.25 ] but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
[ eng.26 ] but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
[ eng.27 ] this is he , of whom it is written , behold , i send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
[ eng.28 ] for i say unto you , among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he .
[ eng.29 ] and all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified god , being baptized with the baptism of john .
[ eng.30 ] but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves , being not baptized of him .
[ eng.31 ] and the lord said , whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
[ eng.32 ] they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , we have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
[ eng.33 ] for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , he hath a devil .
[ eng.34 ] the son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
[ eng.35 ] but wisdom is justified of all her children .
[ eng.36 ] and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
[ eng.37 ] and , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
[ eng.38 ] and stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
[ eng.39 ] now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , this man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
[ eng.40 ] and jesus answering said unto him , simon , i have somewhat to say unto thee . and he saith , master , say on .
[ eng.41 ] there was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
[ eng.42 ] and when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ?
[ eng.43 ] simon answered and said , i suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . and he said unto him , thou hast rightly judged .
[ eng.44 ] and he turned to the woman , and said unto simon , seest thou this woman ? i entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
[ eng.45 ] thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
[ eng.46 ] my head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
[ eng.47 ] wherefore i say unto thee , her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
[ eng.48 ] and he said unto her , thy sins are forgiven .
[ eng.49 ] and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
[ eng.50 ] and he said to the woman , thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god : and the twelve were with him ,
[ eng.2 ] and certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , mary called magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
[ eng.3 ] and joanna the wife of chuza herod 's steward , and susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
[ eng.4 ] and when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :
[ eng.5 ] a sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
[ eng.6 ] and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
[ eng.7 ] and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
[ eng.8 ] and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . and when he had said these things , he cried , he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.9 ] and his disciples asked him , saying , what might this parable be ?
[ eng.10 ] and he said , unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
[ eng.11 ] now the parable is this : the seed is the word of god .
[ eng.12 ] those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
[ eng.13 ] they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
[ eng.14 ] and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
[ eng.15 ] but that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
[ eng.16 ] no man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
[ eng.17 ] for nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
[ eng.18 ] take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
[ eng.19 ] then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
[ eng.20 ] and it was told him by certain which said , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
[ eng.21 ] and he answered and said unto them , my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god , and do it .
[ eng.22 ] now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , let us go over unto the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
[ eng.23 ] but as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
[ eng.24 ] and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
[ eng.25 ] and he said unto them , where is your faith ? and they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , what manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
[ eng.26 ] and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes , which is over against galilee .
[ eng.27 ] and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
[ eng.28 ] when he saw jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , what have i to do with thee , jesus , thou son of god most high ? i beseech thee , torment me not .
[ eng.29 ] ( for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . for oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . )
[ eng.30 ] and jesus asked him , saying , what is thy name ? and he said , legion : because many devils were entered into him .
[ eng.31 ] and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
[ eng.32 ] and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
[ eng.33 ] then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
[ eng.34 ] when they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
[ eng.35 ] then they went out to see what was done ; and came to jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
[ eng.36 ] they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
[ eng.37 ] then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
[ eng.38 ] now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but jesus sent him away , saying ,
[ eng.39 ] return to thine own house , and shew how great things god hath done unto thee . and he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him .
[ eng.40 ] and it came to pass , that , when jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
[ eng.41 ] and , behold , there came a man named jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
[ eng.42 ] for he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . but as he went the people thronged him .
[ eng.43 ] and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
[ eng.44 ] came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
[ eng.45 ] and jesus said , who touched me ? when all denied , peter and they that were with him said , master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
[ eng.46 ] and jesus said , somebody hath touched me : for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
[ eng.47 ] and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
[ eng.48 ] and he said unto her , daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
[ eng.49 ] while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the master .
[ eng.50 ] but when jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
[ eng.51 ] and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save peter , and james , and john , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
[ eng.52 ] and all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
[ eng.53 ] and they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
[ eng.54 ] and he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , maid , arise .
[ eng.55 ] and her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
[ eng.56 ] and her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
[ eng.1 ] then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
[ eng.2 ] and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god , and to heal the sick .
[ eng.3 ] and he said unto them , take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
[ eng.4 ] and whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
[ eng.5 ] and whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
[ eng.6 ] and they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
[ eng.7 ] now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that john was risen from the dead ;
[ eng.8 ] and of some , that elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
[ eng.9 ] and herod said , john have i beheaded : but who is this , of whom i hear such things ? and he desired to see him .
[ eng.10 ] and the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida .
[ eng.11 ] and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of god , and healed them that had need of healing .
[ eng.12 ] and when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
[ eng.13 ] but he said unto them , give ye them to eat . and they said , we have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
[ eng.14 ] for they were about five thousand men . and he said to his disciples , make them sit down by fifties in a company .
[ eng.15 ] and they did so , and made them all sit down .
[ eng.16 ] then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
[ eng.17 ] and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
[ eng.18 ] and it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , whom say the people that i am ?
[ eng.19 ] they answering said , john the baptist ; but some say , elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
[ eng.20 ] he said unto them , but whom say ye that i am ? peter answering said , the christ of god .
[ eng.21 ] and he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
[ eng.22 ] saying , the son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
[ eng.23 ] and he said to them all , if any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
[ eng.24 ] for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
[ eng.25 ] for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
[ eng.26 ] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his father 's , and of the holy angels .
[ eng.27 ] but i tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of god .
[ eng.28 ] and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took peter and john and james , and went up into a mountain to pray .
[ eng.29 ] and as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
[ eng.30 ] and , behold , there talked with him two men , which were moses and elias :
[ eng.31 ] who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem .
[ eng.32 ] but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
[ eng.33 ] and it came to pass , as they departed from him , peter said unto jesus , master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias : not knowing what he said .
[ eng.34 ] while he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
[ eng.35 ] and there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , this is my beloved son : hear him .
[ eng.36 ] and when the voice was past , jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
[ eng.37 ] and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
[ eng.38 ] and , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , master , i beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
[ eng.39 ] and , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
[ eng.40 ] and i besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
[ eng.41 ] and jesus answering said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you , and suffer you ? bring thy son hither .
[ eng.42 ] and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
[ eng.43 ] and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god . but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
[ eng.44 ] let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
[ eng.45 ] but they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
[ eng.46 ] then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
[ eng.47 ] and jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
[ eng.48 ] and said unto them , whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
[ eng.49 ] and john answered and said , master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
[ eng.50 ] and jesus said unto him , forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
[ eng.51 ] and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem ,
[ eng.52 ] and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the samaritans , to make ready for him .
[ eng.53 ] and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem .
[ eng.54 ] and when his disciples james and john saw this , they said , lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as elias did ?
[ eng.55 ] but he turned , and rebuked them , and said , ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
[ eng.56 ] for the son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
[ eng.57 ] and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , lord , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
[ eng.58 ] and jesus said unto him , foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head .
[ eng.59 ] and he said unto another , follow me . but he said , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
[ eng.60 ] jesus said unto him , let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of god .
[ eng.61 ] and another also said , lord , i will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
[ eng.62 ] and jesus said unto him , no man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of god .
[ eng.1 ] after these things the lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
[ eng.2 ] therefore said he unto them , the harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
[ eng.3 ] go your ways : behold , i send you forth as lambs among wolves .
[ eng.4 ] carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
[ eng.5 ] and into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , peace be to this house .
[ eng.6 ] and if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
[ eng.7 ] and in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . go not from house to house .
[ eng.8 ] and into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
[ eng.9 ] and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
[ eng.10 ] but into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
[ eng.11 ] even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
[ eng.12 ] but i say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom , than for that city .
[ eng.13 ] woe unto thee , chorazin ! woe unto thee , bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
[ eng.14 ] but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment , than for you .
[ eng.15 ] and thou , capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
[ eng.16 ] he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
[ eng.17 ] and the seventy returned again with joy , saying , lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
[ eng.18 ] and he said unto them , i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven .
[ eng.19 ] behold , i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
[ eng.20 ] notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
[ eng.21 ] in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , i thank thee , o father , lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
[ eng.22 ] all things are delivered to me of my father : and no man knoweth who the son is , but the father ; and who the father is , but the son , and he to whom the son will reveal him .
[ eng.23 ] and he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
[ eng.24 ] for i tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
[ eng.25 ] and , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , master , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
[ eng.26 ] he said unto him , what is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
[ eng.27 ] and he answering said , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
[ eng.28 ] and he said unto him , thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
[ eng.29 ] but he , willing to justify himself , said unto jesus , and who is my neighbour ?
[ eng.30 ] and jesus answering said , a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
[ eng.31 ] and by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
[ eng.32 ] and likewise a levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
[ eng.33 ] but a certain samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
[ eng.34 ] and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
[ eng.35 ] and on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when i come again , i will repay thee .
[ eng.36 ] which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
[ eng.37 ] and he said , he that shewed mercy on him . then said jesus unto him , go , and do thou likewise .
[ eng.38 ] now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named martha received him into her house .
[ eng.39 ] and she had a sister called mary , which also sat at jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
[ eng.40 ] but martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
[ eng.41 ] and jesus answered and said unto her , martha , martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
[ eng.42 ] but one thing is needful : and mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , lord , teach us to pray , as john also taught his disciples .
[ eng.2 ] and he said unto them , when ye pray , say , our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
[ eng.3 ] give us day by day our daily bread .
[ eng.4 ] and forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
[ eng.5 ] and he said unto them , which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , friend , lend me three loaves ;
[ eng.6 ] for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and i have nothing to set before him ?
[ eng.7 ] and he from within shall answer and say , trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; i cannot rise and give thee .
[ eng.8 ] i say unto you , though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
[ eng.9 ] and i say unto you , ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
[ eng.10 ] for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
[ eng.11 ] if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
[ eng.12 ] or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
[ eng.13 ] if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him ?
[ eng.14 ] and he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . and it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
[ eng.15 ] but some of them said , he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils .
[ eng.16 ] and others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
[ eng.17 ] but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
[ eng.18 ] if satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub .
[ eng.19 ] and if i by beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
[ eng.20 ] but if i with the finger of god cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you .
[ eng.21 ] when a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
[ eng.22 ] but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
[ eng.23 ] he that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
[ eng.24 ] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , i will return unto my house whence i came out .
[ eng.25 ] and when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
[ eng.26 ] then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
[ eng.27 ] and it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
[ eng.28 ] but he said , yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of god , and keep it .
[ eng.29 ] and when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , this is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of jonas the prophet .
[ eng.30 ] for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites , so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
[ eng.31 ] the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and , behold , a greater than solomon is here .
[ eng.32 ] the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of jonas ; and , behold , a greater than jonas is here .
[ eng.33 ] no man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
[ eng.34 ] the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
[ eng.35 ] take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
[ eng.36 ] if thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
[ eng.37 ] and as he spake , a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
[ eng.38 ] and when the pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
[ eng.39 ] and the lord said unto him , now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
[ eng.40 ] ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
[ eng.41 ] but rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
[ eng.42 ] but woe unto you , pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of god : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
[ eng.43 ] woe unto you , pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
[ eng.44 ] woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
[ eng.45 ] then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
[ eng.46 ] and he said , woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
[ eng.47 ] woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
[ eng.48 ] truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
[ eng.49 ] therefore also said the wisdom of god , i will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
[ eng.50 ] that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
[ eng.51 ] from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple : verily i say unto you , it shall be required of this generation .
[ eng.52 ] woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
[ eng.53 ] and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
[ eng.54 ] laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
[ eng.1 ] in the mean time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
[ eng.2 ] for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
[ eng.3 ] therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
[ eng.4 ] and i say unto you my friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
[ eng.5 ] but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , i say unto you , fear him .
[ eng.6 ] are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before god ?
[ eng.7 ] but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
[ eng.8 ] also i say unto you , whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god :
[ eng.9 ] but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god .
[ eng.10 ] and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven .
[ eng.11 ] and when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
[ eng.12 ] for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
[ eng.13 ] and one of the company said unto him , master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
[ eng.14 ] and he said unto him , man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
[ eng.15 ] and he said unto them , take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
[ eng.16 ] and he spake a parable unto them , saying , the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
[ eng.17 ] and he thought within himself , saying , what shall i do , because i have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
[ eng.18 ] and he said , this will i do : i will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods .
[ eng.19 ] and i will say to my soul , soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
[ eng.20 ] but god said unto him , thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
[ eng.21 ] so is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward god .
[ eng.22 ] and he said unto his disciples , therefore i say unto you , take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
[ eng.23 ] the life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
[ eng.24 ] consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and god feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
[ eng.25 ] and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
[ eng.26 ] if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
[ eng.27 ] consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet i say unto you , that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
[ eng.28 ] if then god so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , o ye of little faith ?
[ eng.29 ] and seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
[ eng.30 ] for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
[ eng.31 ] but rather seek ye the kingdom of god ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
[ eng.32 ] fear not , little flock ; for it is your father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
[ eng.33 ] sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
[ eng.34 ] for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
[ eng.35 ] let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
[ eng.36 ] and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
[ eng.37 ] blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily i say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
[ eng.38 ] and if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
[ eng.39 ] and this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
[ eng.40 ] be ye therefore ready also : for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
[ eng.41 ] then peter said unto him , lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
[ eng.42 ] and the lord said , who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
[ eng.43 ] blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
[ eng.44 ] of a truth i say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
[ eng.45 ] but and if that servant say in his heart , my lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
[ eng.46 ] the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
[ eng.47 ] and that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
[ eng.48 ] but he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . for unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
[ eng.49 ] i am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will i , if it be already kindled ?
[ eng.50 ] but i have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am i straitened till it be accomplished !
[ eng.51 ] suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth ? i tell you , nay ; but rather division :
[ eng.52 ] for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
[ eng.53 ] the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
[ eng.54 ] and he said also to the people , when ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , there cometh a shower ; and so it is .
[ eng.55 ] and when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , there will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
[ eng.56 ] ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
[ eng.57 ] yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
[ eng.58 ] when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
[ eng.59 ] i tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite .
[ eng.1 ] there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans , whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
[ eng.2 ] and jesus answering said unto them , suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans , because they suffered such things ?
[ eng.3 ] i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
[ eng.4 ] or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem ?
[ eng.5 ] i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
[ eng.6 ] he spake also this parable ; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
[ eng.7 ] then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , behold , these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
[ eng.8 ] and he answering said unto him , lord , let it alone this year also , till i shall dig about it , and dung it :
[ eng.9 ] and if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .
[ eng.10 ] and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
[ eng.11 ] and , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
[ eng.12 ] and when jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
[ eng.13 ] and he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified god .
[ eng.14 ] and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , there are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
[ eng.15 ] the lord then answered him , and said , thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
[ eng.16 ] and ought not this woman , being a daughter of abraham , whom satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
[ eng.17 ] and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
[ eng.18 ] then said he , unto what is the kingdom of god like ? and whereunto shall i resemble it ?
[ eng.19 ] it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
[ eng.20 ] and again he said , whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god ?
[ eng.21 ] it is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
[ eng.22 ] and he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward jerusalem .
[ eng.23 ] then said one unto him , lord , are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
[ eng.24 ] strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , i say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
[ eng.25 ] when once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , lord , lord , open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you , i know you not whence ye are :
[ eng.26 ] then shall ye begin to say , we have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
[ eng.27 ] but he shall say , i tell you , i know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
[ eng.28 ] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see abraham , and isaac , and jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of god , and you yourselves thrust out .
[ eng.29 ] and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of god .
[ eng.30 ] and , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
[ eng.31 ] the same day there came certain of the pharisees , saying unto him , get thee out , and depart hence : for herod will kill thee .
[ eng.32 ] and he said unto them , go ye , and tell that fox , behold , i cast out devils , and i do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day i shall be perfected .
[ eng.33 ] nevertheless i must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem .
[ eng.34 ] o jerusalem , jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would i have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
[ eng.35 ] behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily i say unto you , ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
[ eng.2 ] and , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
[ eng.3 ] and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
[ eng.4 ] and they held their peace . and he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
[ eng.5 ] and answered them , saying , which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
[ eng.6 ] and they could not answer him again to these things .
[ eng.7 ] and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them .
[ eng.8 ] when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
[ eng.9 ] and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
[ eng.10 ] but when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
[ eng.11 ] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
[ eng.12 ] then said he also to him that bade him , when thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
[ eng.13 ] but when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
[ eng.14 ] and thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
[ eng.15 ] and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god .
[ eng.16 ] then said he unto him , a certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
[ eng.17 ] and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , come ; for all things are now ready .
[ eng.18 ] and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , i have bought a piece of ground , and i must needs go and see it : i pray thee have me excused .
[ eng.19 ] and another said , i have bought five yoke of oxen , and i go to prove them : i pray thee have me excused .
[ eng.20 ] and another said , i have married a wife , and therefore i cannot come .
[ eng.21 ] so that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
[ eng.22 ] and the servant said , lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
[ eng.23 ] and the lord said unto the servant , go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
[ eng.24 ] for i say unto you , that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
[ eng.25 ] and there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
[ eng.26 ] if any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he cannot be my disciple .
[ eng.27 ] and whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
[ eng.28 ] for which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
[ eng.29 ] lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
[ eng.30 ] saying , this man began to build , and was not able to finish .
[ eng.31 ] or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
[ eng.32 ] or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
[ eng.33 ] so likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
[ eng.34 ] salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
[ eng.35 ] it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
[ eng.1 ] then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
[ eng.2 ] and the pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , this man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
[ eng.3 ] and he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
[ eng.4 ] what man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
[ eng.5 ] and when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
[ eng.6 ] and when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , rejoice with me ; for i have found my sheep which was lost .
[ eng.7 ] i say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
[ eng.8 ] either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
[ eng.9 ] and when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , rejoice with me ; for i have found the piece which i had lost .
[ eng.10 ] likewise , i say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth .
[ eng.11 ] and he said , a certain man had two sons :
[ eng.12 ] and the younger of them said to his father , father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
[ eng.13 ] and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
[ eng.14 ] and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
[ eng.15 ] and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
[ eng.16 ] and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
[ eng.17 ] and when he came to himself , he said , how many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and i perish with hunger !
[ eng.18 ] i will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
[ eng.19 ] and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
[ eng.20 ] and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
[ eng.21 ] and the son said unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
[ eng.22 ] but the father said to his servants , bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
[ eng.23 ] and bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
[ eng.24 ] for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
[ eng.25 ] now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
[ eng.26 ] and he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
[ eng.27 ] and he said unto him , thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
[ eng.28 ] and he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
[ eng.29 ] and he answering said to his father , lo , these many years do i serve thee , neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that i might make merry with my friends :
[ eng.30 ] but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
[ eng.31 ] and he said unto him , son , thou art ever with me , and all that i have is thine .
[ eng.32 ] it was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
[ eng.1 ] and he said also unto his disciples , there was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
[ eng.2 ] and he called him , and said unto him , how is it that i hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
[ eng.3 ] then the steward said within himself , what shall i do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : i cannot dig ; to beg i am ashamed .
[ eng.4 ] i am resolved what to do , that , when i am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
[ eng.5 ] so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , how much owest thou unto my lord ?
[ eng.6 ] and he said , an hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
[ eng.7 ] then said he to another , and how much owest thou ? and he said , an hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , take thy bill , and write fourscore .
[ eng.8 ] and the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
[ eng.9 ] and i say unto you , make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
[ eng.10 ] he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
[ eng.11 ] if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
[ eng.12 ] and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
[ eng.13 ] no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye cannot serve god and mammon .
[ eng.14 ] and the pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
[ eng.15 ] and he said unto them , ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but god knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god .
[ eng.16 ] the law and the prophets were until john : since that time the kingdom of god is preached , and every man presseth into it .
[ eng.17 ] and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
[ eng.18 ] whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
[ eng.19 ] there was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
[ eng.20 ] and there was a certain beggar named lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
[ eng.21 ] and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
[ eng.22 ] and it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into abraham 's bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
[ eng.23 ] and in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth abraham afar off , and lazarus in his bosom .
[ eng.24 ] and he cried and said , father abraham , have mercy on me , and send lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for i am tormented in this flame .
[ eng.25 ] but abraham said , son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
[ eng.26 ] and beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
[ eng.27 ] then he said , i pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father 's house :
[ eng.28 ] for i have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
[ eng.29 ] abraham saith unto him , they have moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
[ eng.30 ] and he said , nay , father abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
[ eng.31 ] and he said unto him , if they hear not moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
[ eng.1 ] then said he unto the disciples , it is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
[ eng.2 ] it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
[ eng.3 ] take heed to yourselves : if thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
[ eng.4 ] and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , i repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
[ eng.5 ] and the apostles said unto the lord , increase our faith .
[ eng.6 ] and the lord said , if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
[ eng.7 ] but which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , go and sit down to meat ?
[ eng.8 ] and will not rather say unto him , make ready wherewith i may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till i have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
[ eng.9 ] doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? i trow not .
[ eng.10 ] so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , we are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
[ eng.11 ] and it came to pass , as he went to jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee .
[ eng.12 ] and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
[ eng.13 ] and they lifted up their voices , and said , jesus , master , have mercy on us .
[ eng.14 ] and when he saw them , he said unto them , go shew yourselves unto the priests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
[ eng.15 ] and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified god ,
[ eng.16 ] and fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a samaritan .
[ eng.17 ] and jesus answering said , were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
[ eng.18 ] there are not found that returned to give glory to god , save this stranger .
[ eng.19 ] and he said unto him , arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
[ eng.20 ] and when he was demanded of the pharisees , when the kingdom of god should come , he answered them and said , the kingdom of god cometh not with observation :
[ eng.21 ] neither shall they say , lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of god is within you .
[ eng.22 ] and he said unto the disciples , the days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man , and ye shall not see it .
[ eng.23 ] and they shall say to you , see here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
[ eng.24 ] for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the son of man be in his day .
[ eng.25 ] but first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
[ eng.26 ] and as it was in the days of noe , so shall it be also in the days of the son of man .
[ eng.27 ] they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
[ eng.28 ] likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
[ eng.29 ] but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
[ eng.30 ] even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed .
[ eng.31 ] in that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
[ eng.32 ] remember lot 's wife .
[ eng.33 ] whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
[ eng.34 ] i tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
[ eng.35 ] two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
[ eng.36 ] two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
[ eng.37 ] and they answered and said unto him , where , lord ? and he said unto them , wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
[ eng.1 ] and he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
[ eng.2 ] saying , there was in a city a judge , which feared not god , neither regarded man :
[ eng.3 ] and there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , avenge me of mine adversary .
[ eng.4 ] and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , though i fear not god , nor regard man ;
[ eng.5 ] yet because this widow troubleth me , i will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
[ eng.6 ] and the lord said , hear what the unjust judge saith .
[ eng.7 ] and shall not god avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
[ eng.8 ] i tell you that he will avenge them speedily . nevertheless when the son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
[ eng.9 ] and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
[ eng.10 ] two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a pharisee , and the other a publican .
[ eng.11 ] the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , god , i thank thee , that i am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
[ eng.12 ] i fast twice in the week , i give tithes of all that i possess .
[ eng.13 ] and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , god be merciful to me a sinner .
[ eng.14 ] i tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
[ eng.15 ] and they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
[ eng.16 ] but jesus called them unto him , and said , suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
[ eng.17 ] verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
[ eng.18 ] and a certain ruler asked him , saying , good master , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
[ eng.19 ] and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , god .
[ eng.20 ] thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , honour thy father and thy mother .
[ eng.21 ] and he said , all these have i kept from my youth up .
[ eng.22 ] now when jesus heard these things , he said unto him , yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
[ eng.23 ] and when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
[ eng.24 ] and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
[ eng.25 ] for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
[ eng.26 ] and they that heard it said , who then can be saved ?
[ eng.27 ] and he said , the things which are impossible with men are possible with god .
[ eng.28 ] then peter said , lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
[ eng.29 ] and he said unto them , verily i say unto you , there is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of god 's sake ,
[ eng.30 ] who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
[ eng.31 ] then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , behold , we go up to jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished .
[ eng.32 ] for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
[ eng.33 ] and they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
[ eng.34 ] and they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
[ eng.35 ] and it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
[ eng.36 ] and hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
[ eng.37 ] and they told him , that jesus of nazareth passeth by .
[ eng.38 ] and he cried , saying , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
[ eng.39 ] and they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
[ eng.40 ] and jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
[ eng.41 ] saying , what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee ? and he said , lord , that i may receive my sight .
[ eng.42 ] and jesus said unto him , receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
[ eng.43 ] and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying god : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto god .
[ eng.1 ] and jesus entered and passed through jericho .
[ eng.2 ] and , behold , there was a man named zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
[ eng.3 ] and he sought to see jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
[ eng.4 ] and he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
[ eng.5 ] and when jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day i must abide at thy house .
[ eng.6 ] and he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
[ eng.7 ] and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
[ eng.8 ] and zacchaeus stood , and said unto the lord : behold , lord , the half of my goods i give to the poor ; and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , i restore him fourfold .
[ eng.9 ] and jesus said unto him , this day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham .
[ eng.10 ] for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
[ eng.11 ] and as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear .
[ eng.12 ] he said therefore , a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
[ eng.13 ] and he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , occupy till i come .
[ eng.14 ] but his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , we will not have this man to reign over us .
[ eng.15 ] and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
[ eng.16 ] then came the first , saying , lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
[ eng.17 ] and he said unto him , well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
[ eng.18 ] and the second came , saying , lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
[ eng.19 ] and he said likewise to him , be thou also over five cities .
[ eng.20 ] and another came , saying , lord , behold , here is thy pound , which i have kept laid up in a napkin :
[ eng.21 ] for i feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
[ eng.22 ] and he saith unto him , out of thine own mouth will i judge thee , thou wicked servant . thou knewest that i was an austere man , taking up that i laid not down , and reaping that i did not sow :
[ eng.23 ] wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury ?
[ eng.24 ] and he said unto them that stood by , take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
[ eng.25 ] ( and they said unto him , lord , he hath ten pounds . )
[ eng.26 ] for i say unto you , that unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
[ eng.27 ] but those mine enemies , which would not that i should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
[ eng.28 ] and when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to jerusalem .
[ eng.29 ] and it came to pass , when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany , at the mount called the mount of olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
[ eng.30 ] saying , go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
[ eng.31 ] and if any man ask you , why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , because the lord hath need of him .
[ eng.32 ] and they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
[ eng.33 ] and as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , why loose ye the colt ?
[ eng.34 ] and they said , the lord hath need of him .
[ eng.35 ] and they brought him to jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set jesus thereon .
[ eng.36 ] and as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
[ eng.37 ] and when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
[ eng.38 ] saying , blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
[ eng.39 ] and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , master , rebuke thy disciples .
[ eng.40 ] and he answered and said unto them , i tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
[ eng.41 ] and when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
[ eng.42 ] saying , if thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
[ eng.43 ] for the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
[ eng.44 ] and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
[ eng.45 ] and he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
[ eng.46 ] saying unto them , it is written , my house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
[ eng.47 ] and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
[ eng.48 ] and could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
[ eng.2 ] and spake unto him , saying , tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
[ eng.3 ] and he answered and said unto them , i will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
[ eng.4 ] the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or of men ?
[ eng.5 ] and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then believed ye him not ?
[ eng.6 ] but and if we say , of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that john was a prophet .
[ eng.7 ] and they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
[ eng.8 ] and jesus said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
[ eng.9 ] then began he to speak to the people this parable ; a certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
[ eng.10 ] and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
[ eng.11 ] and again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
[ eng.12 ] and again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
[ eng.13 ] then said the lord of the vineyard , what shall i do ? i will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
[ eng.14 ] but when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , this is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
[ eng.15 ] so they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
[ eng.16 ] he shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . and when they heard it , they said , god forbid .
[ eng.17 ] and he beheld them , and said , what is this then that is written , the stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
[ eng.18 ] whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
[ eng.19 ] and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
[ eng.20 ] and they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
[ eng.21 ] and they asked him , saying , master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of god truly :
[ eng.22 ] is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar , or no ?
[ eng.23 ] but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , why tempt ye me ?
[ eng.24 ] shew me a penny . whose image and superscription hath it ? they answered and said , caesar 's .
[ eng.25 ] and he said unto them , render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar 's , and unto god the things which be god 's .
[ eng.26 ] and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
[ eng.27 ] then came to him certain of the sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
[ eng.28 ] saying , master , moses wrote unto us , if any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
[ eng.29 ] there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
[ eng.30 ] and the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
[ eng.31 ] and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
[ eng.32 ] last of all the woman died also .
[ eng.33 ] therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
[ eng.34 ] and jesus answering said unto them , the children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
[ eng.35 ] but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
[ eng.36 ] neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of god , being the children of the resurrection .
[ eng.37 ] now that the dead are raised , even moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the lord the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob .
[ eng.38 ] for he is not a god of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
[ eng.39 ] then certain of the scribes answering said , master , thou hast well said .
[ eng.40 ] and after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
[ eng.41 ] and he said unto them , how say they that christ is david 's son ?
[ eng.42 ] and david himself saith in the book of psalms , the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
[ eng.43 ] till i make thine enemies thy footstool .
[ eng.44 ] david therefore calleth him lord , how is he then his son ?
[ eng.45 ] then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
[ eng.46 ] beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
[ eng.47 ] which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
[ eng.1 ] and he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
[ eng.2 ] and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
[ eng.3 ] and he said , of a truth i say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
[ eng.4 ] for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
[ eng.5 ] and as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
[ eng.6 ] as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
[ eng.7 ] and they asked him , saying , master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
[ eng.8 ] and he said , take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
[ eng.9 ] but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
[ eng.10 ] then said he unto them , nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
[ eng.11 ] and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
[ eng.12 ] but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
[ eng.13 ] and it shall turn to you for a testimony .
[ eng.14 ] settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
[ eng.15 ] for i will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
[ eng.16 ] and ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
[ eng.17 ] and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
[ eng.18 ] but there shall not an hair of your head perish .
[ eng.19 ] in your patience possess ye your souls .
[ eng.20 ] and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
[ eng.21 ] then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
[ eng.22 ] for these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
[ eng.23 ] but woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
[ eng.24 ] and they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles , until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled .
[ eng.25 ] and there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
[ eng.26 ] men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
[ eng.27 ] and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
[ eng.28 ] and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
[ eng.29 ] and he spake to them a parable ; behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
[ eng.30 ] when they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
[ eng.31 ] so likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand .
[ eng.32 ] verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
[ eng.33 ] heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
[ eng.34 ] and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
[ eng.35 ] for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
[ eng.36 ] watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the son of man .
[ eng.37 ] and in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives .
[ eng.38 ] and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
[ eng.1 ] now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the passover .
[ eng.2 ] and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
[ eng.3 ] then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
[ eng.4 ] and he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
[ eng.5 ] and they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
[ eng.6 ] and he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
[ eng.7 ] then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
[ eng.8 ] and he sent peter and john , saying , go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
[ eng.9 ] and they said unto him , where wilt thou that we prepare ?
[ eng.10 ] and he said unto them , behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
[ eng.11 ] and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , the master saith unto thee , where is the guestchamber , where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
[ eng.12 ] and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
[ eng.13 ] and they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
[ eng.14 ] and when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
[ eng.15 ] and he said unto them , with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer :
[ eng.16 ] for i say unto you , i will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god .
[ eng.17 ] and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , take this , and divide it among yourselves :
[ eng.18 ] for i say unto you , i will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of god shall come .
[ eng.19 ] and he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , this is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
[ eng.20 ] likewise also the cup after supper , saying , this cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
[ eng.21 ] but , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
[ eng.22 ] and truly the son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
[ eng.23 ] and they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
[ eng.24 ] and there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
[ eng.25 ] and he said unto them , the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
[ eng.26 ] but ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
[ eng.27 ] for whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but i am among you as he that serveth .
[ eng.28 ] ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
[ eng.29 ] and i appoint unto you a kingdom , as my father hath appointed unto me ;
[ eng.30 ] that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel .
[ eng.31 ] and the lord said , simon , simon , behold , satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
[ eng.32 ] but i have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
[ eng.33 ] and he said unto him , lord , i am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
[ eng.34 ] and he said , i tell thee , peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
[ eng.35 ] and he said unto them , when i sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? and they said , nothing .
[ eng.36 ] then said he unto them , but now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
[ eng.37 ] for i say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , and he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
[ eng.38 ] and they said , lord , behold , here are two swords . and he said unto them , it is enough .
[ eng.39 ] and he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
[ eng.40 ] and when he was at the place , he said unto them , pray that ye enter not into temptation .
[ eng.41 ] and he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
[ eng.42 ] saying , father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
[ eng.43 ] and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
[ eng.44 ] and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
[ eng.45 ] and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
[ eng.46 ] and said unto them , why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
[ eng.47 ] and while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto jesus to kiss him .
[ eng.48 ] but jesus said unto him , judas , betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss ?
[ eng.49 ] when they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
[ eng.50 ] and one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
[ eng.51 ] and jesus answered and said , suffer ye thus far . and he touched his ear , and healed him .
[ eng.52 ] then jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
[ eng.53 ] when i was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
[ eng.54 ] then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . and peter followed afar off .
[ eng.55 ] and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , peter sat down among them .
[ eng.56 ] but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , this man was also with him .
[ eng.57 ] and he denied him , saying , woman , i know him not .
[ eng.58 ] and after a little while another saw him , and said , thou art also of them . and peter said , man , i am not .
[ eng.59 ] and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a galilaean .
[ eng.60 ] and peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest . and immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
[ eng.61 ] and the lord turned , and looked upon peter . and peter remembered the word of the lord , how he had said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
[ eng.62 ] and peter went out , and wept bitterly .
[ eng.63 ] and the men that held jesus mocked him , and smote him .
[ eng.64 ] and when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
[ eng.65 ] and many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
[ eng.66 ] and as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
[ eng.67 ] art thou the christ ? tell us . and he said unto them , if i tell you , ye will not believe :
[ eng.68 ] and if i also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
[ eng.69 ] hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god .
[ eng.70 ] then said they all , art thou then the son of god ? and he said unto them , ye say that i am .
[ eng.71 ] and they said , what need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
[ eng.1 ] and the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto pilate .
[ eng.2 ] and they began to accuse him , saying , we found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to caesar , saying that he himself is christ a king .
[ eng.3 ] and pilate asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answered him and said , thou sayest it .
[ eng.4 ] then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people , i find no fault in this man .
[ eng.5 ] and they were the more fierce , saying , he stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all jewry , beginning from galilee to this place .
[ eng.6 ] when pilate heard of galilee , he asked whether the man were a galilaean .
[ eng.7 ] and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to herod , who himself also was at jerusalem at that time .
[ eng.8 ] and when herod saw jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
[ eng.9 ] then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
[ eng.10 ] and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
[ eng.11 ] and herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to pilate .
[ eng.12 ] and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
[ eng.13 ] and pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
[ eng.14 ] said unto them , ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , i , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
[ eng.15 ] no , nor yet herod : for i sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
[ eng.16 ] i will therefore chastise him , and release him .
[ eng.17 ] ( for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
[ eng.18 ] and they cried out all at once , saying , away with this man , and release unto us barabbas :
[ eng.19 ] ( who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
[ eng.20 ] pilate therefore , willing to release jesus , spake again to them .
[ eng.21 ] but they cried , saying , crucify him , crucify him .
[ eng.22 ] and he said unto them the third time , why , what evil hath he done ? i have found no cause of death in him : i will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
[ eng.23 ] and they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
[ eng.24 ] and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
[ eng.25 ] and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered jesus to their will .
[ eng.26 ] and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one simon , a cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after jesus .
[ eng.27 ] and there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
[ eng.28 ] but jesus turning unto them said , daughters of jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
[ eng.29 ] for , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
[ eng.30 ] then shall they begin to say to the mountains , fall on us ; and to the hills , cover us .
[ eng.31 ] for if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
[ eng.32 ] and there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
[ eng.33 ] and when they were come to the place , which is called calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
[ eng.34 ] then said jesus , father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . and they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
[ eng.35 ] and the people stood beholding . and the rulers also with them derided him , saying , he saved others ; let him save himself , if he be christ , the chosen of god .
[ eng.36 ] and the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
[ eng.37 ] and saying , if thou be the king of the jews , save thyself .
[ eng.38 ] and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek , and latin , and hebrew , this is the king of the jews .
[ eng.39 ] and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , if thou be christ , save thyself and us .
[ eng.40 ] but the other answering rebuked him , saying , dost not thou fear god , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
[ eng.41 ] and we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
[ eng.42 ] and he said unto jesus , lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom .
[ eng.43 ] and jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , to day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
[ eng.44 ] and it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
[ eng.45 ] and the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
[ eng.46 ] and when jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , father , into thy hands i commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
[ eng.47 ] now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified god , saying , certainly this was a righteous man .
[ eng.48 ] and all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
[ eng.49 ] and all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
[ eng.50 ] and , behold , there was a man named joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just :
[ eng.51 ] ( the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of arimathaea , a city of the jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of god .
[ eng.52 ] this man went unto pilate , and begged the body of jesus .
[ eng.53 ] and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
[ eng.54 ] and that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
[ eng.55 ] and the women also , which came with him from galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
[ eng.56 ] and they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment .
[ eng.1 ] now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
[ eng.2 ] and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
[ eng.3 ] and they entered in , and found not the body of the lord jesus .
[ eng.4 ] and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
[ eng.5 ] and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , why seek ye the living among the dead ?
[ eng.6 ] he is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
[ eng.7 ] saying , the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
[ eng.8 ] and they remembered his words ,
[ eng.9 ] and returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
[ eng.10 ] it was mary magdalene and joanna , and mary the mother of james , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
[ eng.11 ] and their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
[ eng.12 ] then arose peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
[ eng.13 ] and , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus , which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
[ eng.14 ] and they talked together of all these things which had happened .
[ eng.15 ] and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
[ eng.16 ] but their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
[ eng.17 ] and he said unto them , what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
[ eng.18 ] and the one of them , whose name was cleopas , answering said unto him , art thou only a stranger in jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
[ eng.19 ] and he said unto them , what things ? and they said unto him , concerning jesus of nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people :
[ eng.20 ] and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
[ eng.21 ] but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
[ eng.22 ] yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
[ eng.23 ] and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive .
[ eng.24 ] and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
[ eng.25 ] then he said unto them , o fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
[ eng.26 ] ought not christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
[ eng.27 ] and beginning at moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
[ eng.28 ] and they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
[ eng.29 ] but they constrained him , saying , abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . and he went in to tarry with them .
[ eng.30 ] and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
[ eng.31 ] and their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
[ eng.32 ] and they said one to another , did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
[ eng.33 ] and they rose up the same hour , and returned to jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
[ eng.34 ] saying , the lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to simon .
[ eng.35 ] and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
[ eng.36 ] and as they thus spake , jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
[ eng.37 ] but they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
[ eng.38 ] and he said unto them , why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
[ eng.39 ] behold my hands and my feet , that it is i myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
[ eng.40 ] and when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
[ eng.41 ] and while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , have ye here any meat ?
[ eng.42 ] and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
[ eng.43 ] and he took it , and did eat before them .
[ eng.44 ] and he said unto them , these are the words which i spake unto you , while i was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
[ eng.45 ] then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
[ eng.46 ] and said unto them , thus it is written , and thus it behoved christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
[ eng.47 ] and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at jerusalem .
[ eng.48 ] and ye are witnesses of these things .
[ eng.49 ] and , behold , i send the promise of my father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
[ eng.50 ] and he led them out as far as to bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
[ eng.51 ] and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
[ eng.52 ] and they worshipped him , and returned to jerusalem with great joy :
[ eng.53 ] and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing god . amen
[ eng.1 ] the former treatise have i made , o theophilus , of all that jesus began both to do and teach ,
[ eng.2 ] until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
[ eng.3 ] to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god :
[ eng.4 ] and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
[ eng.5 ] for john truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence .
[ eng.6 ] when they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel ?
[ eng.7 ] and he said unto them , it is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the father hath put in his own power .
[ eng.8 ] but ye shall receive power , after that the holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem , and in all judaea , and in samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
[ eng.9 ] and when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
[ eng.10 ] and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ;
[ eng.11 ] which also said , ye men of galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
[ eng.12 ] then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet , which is from jerusalem a sabbath day 's journey .
[ eng.13 ] and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both peter , and james , and john , and andrew , philip , and thomas , bartholomew , and matthew , james the son of alphaeus , and simon zelotes , and judas the brother of james .
[ eng.14 ] these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and mary the mother of jesus , and with his brethren .
[ eng.15 ] and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples , and said , ( the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty , )
[ eng.16 ] men and brethren , this scripture must needs have been fulfilled , which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas , which was guide to them that took jesus .
[ eng.17 ] for he was numbered with us , and had obtained part of this ministry .
[ eng.18 ] now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
[ eng.19 ] and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , aceldama , that is to say , the field of blood .
[ eng.20 ] for it is written in the book of psalms , let his habitation be desolate , and let no man dwell therein : and his bishoprick let another take .
[ eng.21 ] wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us ,
[ eng.22 ] beginning from the baptism of john , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
[ eng.23 ] and they appointed two , joseph called barsabas , who was surnamed justus , and matthias .
[ eng.24 ] and they prayed , and said , thou , lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
[ eng.25 ] that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
[ eng.26 ] and they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
[ eng.1 ] and when the day of pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
[ eng.2 ] and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
[ eng.3 ] and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
[ eng.4 ] and they were all filled with the holy ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the spirit gave them utterance .
[ eng.5 ] and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews , devout men , out of every nation under heaven .
[ eng.6 ] now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
[ eng.7 ] and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , behold , are not all these which speak galilaeans ?
[ eng.8 ] and how hear we every man in our own tongue , wherein we were born ?
[ eng.9 ] parthians , and medes , and elamites , and the dwellers in mesopotamia , and in judaea , and cappadocia , in pontus , and asia ,
[ eng.10 ] phrygia , and pamphylia , in egypt , and in the parts of libya about cyrene , and strangers of rome , jews and proselytes ,
[ eng.11 ] cretes and arabians , we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god .
[ eng.12 ] and they were all amazed , and were in doubt , saying one to another , what meaneth this ?
[ eng.13 ] others mocking said , these men are full of new wine .
[ eng.14 ] but peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , ye men of judaea , and all ye that dwell at jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
[ eng.15 ] for these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
[ eng.16 ] but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel ;
[ eng.17 ] and it shall come to pass in the last days , saith god , i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
[ eng.18 ] and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
[ eng.19 ] and i will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
[ eng.20 ] the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and notable day of the lord come :
[ eng.21 ] and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
[ eng.22 ] ye men of israel , hear these words ; jesus of nazareth , a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which god did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
[ eng.23 ] him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
[ eng.24 ] whom god hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
[ eng.25 ] for david speaketh concerning him , i foresaw the lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that i should not be moved :
[ eng.26 ] therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
[ eng.27 ] because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
[ eng.28 ] thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
[ eng.29 ] men and brethren , let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david , that he is both dead and buried , and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
[ eng.30 ] therefore being a prophet , and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up christ to sit on his throne ;
[ eng.31 ] he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
[ eng.32 ] this jesus hath god raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
[ eng.33 ] therefore being by the right hand of god exalted , and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
[ eng.34 ] for david is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
[ eng.35 ] until i make thy foes thy footstool .
[ eng.36 ] therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly , that god hath made the same jesus , whom ye have crucified , both lord and christ .
[ eng.37 ] now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles , men and brethren , what shall we do ?
[ eng.38 ] then peter said unto them , repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost .
[ eng.39 ] for the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the lord our god shall call .
[ eng.40 ] and with many other words did he testify and exhort , saying , save yourselves from this untoward generation .
[ eng.41 ] then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
[ eng.42 ] and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
[ eng.43 ] and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
[ eng.44 ] and all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
[ eng.45 ] and sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
[ eng.46 ] and they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
[ eng.47 ] praising god , and having favour with all the people . and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
[ eng.1 ] now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
[ eng.2 ] and a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
[ eng.3 ] who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms .
[ eng.4 ] and peter , fastening his eyes upon him with john , said , look on us .
[ eng.5 ] and he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something of them .
[ eng.6 ] then peter said , silver and gold have i none ; but such as i have give i thee : in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk .
[ eng.7 ] and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength .
[ eng.8 ] and he leaping up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising god .
[ eng.9 ] and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
[ eng.10 ] and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
[ eng.11 ] and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon 's , greatly wondering .
[ eng.12 ] and when peter saw it , he answered unto the people , ye men of israel , why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ?
[ eng.13 ] the god of abraham , and of isaac , and of jacob , the god of our fathers , hath glorified his son jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
[ eng.14 ] but ye denied the holy one and the just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
[ eng.15 ] and killed the prince of life , whom god hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
[ eng.16 ] and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
[ eng.17 ] and now , brethren , i wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
[ eng.18 ] but those things , which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled .
[ eng.19 ] repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord .
[ eng.20 ] and he shall send jesus christ , which before was preached unto you :
[ eng.21 ] whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
[ eng.22 ] for moses truly said unto the fathers , a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
[ eng.23 ] and it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
[ eng.24 ] yea , and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
[ eng.25 ] ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which god made with our fathers , saying unto abraham , and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
[ eng.26 ] unto you first god , having raised up his son jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
[ eng.1 ] and as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the sadducees , came upon them ,
[ eng.2 ] being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead .
[ eng.3 ] and they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
[ eng.4 ] howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
[ eng.5 ] and it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
[ eng.6 ] and annas the high priest , and caiaphas , and john , and alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at jerusalem .
[ eng.7 ] and when they had set them in the midst , they asked , by what power , or by what name , have ye done this ?
[ eng.8 ] then peter , filled with the holy ghost , said unto them , ye rulers of the people , and elders of israel ,
[ eng.9 ] if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
[ eng.10 ] be it known unto you all , and to all the people of israel , that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom god raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
[ eng.11 ] this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is become the head of the corner .
[ eng.12 ] neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
[ eng.13 ] now when they saw the boldness of peter and john , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with jesus .
[ eng.14 ] and beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
[ eng.15 ] but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
[ eng.16 ] saying , what shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
[ eng.17 ] but that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
[ eng.18 ] and they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
[ eng.19 ] but peter and john answered and said unto them , whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god , judge ye .
[ eng.20 ] for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
[ eng.21 ] so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified god for that which was done .
[ eng.22 ] for the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
[ eng.23 ] and being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
[ eng.24 ] and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to god with one accord , and said , lord , thou art god , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
[ eng.25 ] who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said , why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
[ eng.26 ] the kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against the lord , and against his christ .
[ eng.27 ] for of a truth against thy holy child jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both herod , and pontius pilate , with the gentiles , and the people of israel , were gathered together ,
[ eng.28 ] for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
[ eng.29 ] and now , lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
[ eng.30 ] by stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus .
[ eng.31 ] and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the holy ghost , and they spake the word of god with boldness .
[ eng.32 ] and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
[ eng.33 ] and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
[ eng.34 ] neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
[ eng.35 ] and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
[ eng.36 ] and joses , who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas , ( which is , being interpreted , the son of consolation , ) a levite , and of the country of cyprus ,
[ eng.37 ] having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
[ eng.1 ] but a certain man named ananias , with sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
[ eng.2 ] and kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
[ eng.3 ] but peter said , ananias , why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
[ eng.4 ] whiles it remained , was it not thine own ? and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not lied unto men , but unto god .
[ eng.5 ] and ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
[ eng.6 ] and the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
[ eng.7 ] and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
[ eng.8 ] and peter answered unto her , tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ? and she said , yea , for so much .
[ eng.9 ] then peter said unto her , how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord ? behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door , and shall carry thee out .
[ eng.10 ] then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
[ eng.11 ] and great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
[ eng.12 ] and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in solomon 's porch .
[ eng.13 ] and of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
[ eng.14 ] and believers were the more added to the lord , multitudes both of men and women . )
[ eng.15 ] insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
[ eng.16 ] there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
[ eng.17 ] then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the sadducees , ) and were filled with indignation ,
[ eng.18 ] and laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison .
[ eng.19 ] but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
[ eng.20 ] go , stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
[ eng.21 ] and when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . but the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of israel , and sent to the prison to have them brought .
[ eng.22 ] but when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned and told ,
[ eng.23 ] saying , the prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
[ eng.24 ] now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
[ eng.25 ] then came one and told them , saying , behold , the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple , and teaching the people .
[ eng.26 ] then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
[ eng.27 ] and when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
[ eng.28 ] saying , did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
[ eng.29 ] then peter and the other apostles answered and said , we ought to obey god rather than men .
[ eng.30 ] the god of our fathers raised up jesus , whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
[ eng.31 ] him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour , for to give repentance to israel , and forgiveness of sins .
[ eng.32 ] and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the holy ghost , whom god hath given to them that obey him .
[ eng.33 ] when they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
[ eng.34 ] then stood there up one in the council , a pharisee , named gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;
[ eng.35 ] and said unto them , ye men of israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
[ eng.36 ] for before these days rose up theudas , boasting himself to be somebody ; to whom a number of men , about four hundred , joined themselves : who was slain ; and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered , and brought to nought .
[ eng.37 ] after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
[ eng.38 ] and now i say unto you , refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought :
[ eng.39 ] but if it be of god , ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found even to fight against god .
[ eng.40 ] and to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus , and let them go .
[ eng.41 ] and they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
[ eng.42 ] and daily in the temple , and in every house , they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ .
[ eng.1 ] and in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
[ eng.2 ] then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , it is not reason that we should leave the word of god , and serve tables .
[ eng.3 ] wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the holy ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
[ eng.4 ] but we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
[ eng.5 ] and the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose stephen , a man full of faith and of the holy ghost , and philip , and prochorus , and nicanor , and timon , and parmenas , and nicolas a proselyte of antioch :
[ eng.6 ] whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
[ eng.7 ] and the word of god increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
[ eng.8 ] and stephen , full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
[ eng.9 ] then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the libertines , and cyrenians , and alexandrians , and of them of cilicia and of asia , disputing with stephen .
[ eng.10 ] and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
[ eng.11 ] then they suborned men , which said , we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses , and against god .
[ eng.12 ] and they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
[ eng.13 ] and set up false witnesses , which said , this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law :
[ eng.14 ] for we have heard him say , that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which moses delivered us .
[ eng.15 ] and all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
[ eng.1 ] then said the high priest , are these things so ?
[ eng.2 ] and he said , men , brethren , and fathers , hearken ; the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham , when he was in mesopotamia , before he dwelt in charran ,
[ eng.3 ] and said unto him , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which i shall shew thee .
[ eng.4 ] then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans , and dwelt in charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
[ eng.5 ] and he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
[ eng.6 ] and god spake on this wise , that his seed should sojourn in a strange land ; and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them evil four hundred years .
[ eng.7 ] and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge , said god : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
[ eng.8 ] and he gave him the covenant of circumcision : and so abraham begat isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs .
[ eng.9 ] and the patriarchs , moved with envy , sold joseph into egypt : but god was with him ,
[ eng.10 ] and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt ; and he made him governor over egypt and all his house .
[ eng.11 ] now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
[ eng.12 ] but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
[ eng.13 ] and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren ; and joseph 's kindred was made known unto pharaoh .
[ eng.14 ] then sent joseph , and called his father jacob to him , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
[ eng.15 ] so jacob went down into egypt , and died , he , and our fathers ,
[ eng.16 ] and were carried over into sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem .
[ eng.17 ] but when the time of the promise drew nigh , which god had sworn to abraham , the people grew and multiplied in egypt ,
[ eng.18 ] till another king arose , which knew not joseph .
[ eng.19 ] the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
[ eng.20 ] in which time moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father 's house three months :
[ eng.21 ] and when he was cast out , pharaoh 's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
[ eng.22 ] and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
[ eng.23 ] and when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel .
[ eng.24 ] and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the egyptian :
[ eng.25 ] for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
[ eng.26 ] and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
[ eng.27 ] but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
[ eng.28 ] wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday ?
[ eng.29 ] then fled moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of madian , where he begat two sons .
[ eng.30 ] and when forty years were expired , there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
[ eng.31 ] when moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it , the voice of the lord came unto him ,
[ eng.32 ] saying , i am the god of thy fathers , the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob . then moses trembled , and durst not behold .
[ eng.33 ] then said the lord to him , put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
[ eng.34 ] i have seen , i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt , and i have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , i will send thee into egypt .
[ eng.35 ] this moses whom they refused , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
[ eng.36 ] he brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt , and in the red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
[ eng.37 ] this is that moses , which said unto the children of israel , a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
[ eng.38 ] this is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
[ eng.39 ] to whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into egypt ,
[ eng.40 ] saying unto aaron , make us gods to go before us : for as for this moses , which brought us out of the land of egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
[ eng.41 ] and they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
[ eng.42 ] then god turned , and gave them up to worship the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets , o ye house of israel , have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
[ eng.43 ] yea , ye took up the tabernacle of moloch , and the star of your god remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and i will carry you away beyond babylon .
[ eng.44 ] our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking unto moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
[ eng.45 ] which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles , whom god drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of david ;
[ eng.46 ] who found favour before god , and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob .
[ eng.47 ] but solomon built him an house .
[ eng.48 ] howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
[ eng.49 ] heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
[ eng.50 ] hath not my hand made all these things ?
[ eng.51 ] ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the holy ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
[ eng.52 ] which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
[ eng.53 ] who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
[ eng.54 ] when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
[ eng.55 ] but he , being full of the holy ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of god , and jesus standing on the right hand of god ,
[ eng.56 ] and said , behold , i see the heavens opened , and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
[ eng.57 ] then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
[ eng.58 ] and cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was saul .
[ eng.59 ] and they stoned stephen , calling upon god , and saying , lord jesus , receive my spirit .
[ eng.60 ] and he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , lord , lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this , he fell asleep .
[ eng.1 ] and saul was consenting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria , except the apostles .
[ eng.2 ] and devout men carried stephen to his burial , and made great lamentation over him .
[ eng.3 ] as for saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
[ eng.4 ] therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
[ eng.5 ] then philip went down to the city of samaria , and preached christ unto them .
[ eng.6 ] and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
[ eng.7 ] for unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
[ eng.8 ] and there was great joy in that city .
[ eng.9 ] but there was a certain man , called simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
[ eng.10 ] to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , this man is the great power of god .
[ eng.11 ] and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
[ eng.12 ] but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god , and the name of jesus christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
[ eng.13 ] then simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
[ eng.14 ] now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god , they sent unto them peter and john :
[ eng.15 ] who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the holy ghost :
[ eng.16 ] ( for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus . )
[ eng.17 ] then laid they their hands on them , and they received the holy ghost .
[ eng.18 ] and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the holy ghost was given , he offered them money ,
[ eng.19 ] saying , give me also this power , that on whomsoever i lay hands , he may receive the holy ghost .
[ eng.20 ] but peter said unto him , thy money perish with thee , because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money .
[ eng.21 ] thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of god .
[ eng.22 ] repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray god , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
[ eng.23 ] for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
[ eng.24 ] then answered simon , and said , pray ye to the lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
[ eng.25 ] and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the lord , returned to jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans .
[ eng.26 ] and the angel of the lord spake unto philip , saying , arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza , which is desert .
[ eng.27 ] and he arose and went : and , behold , a man of ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to jerusalem for to worship ,
[ eng.28 ] was returning , and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet .
[ eng.29 ] then the spirit said unto philip , go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
[ eng.30 ] and philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet esaias , and said , understandest thou what thou readest ?
[ eng.31 ] and he said , how can i , except some man should guide me ? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him .
[ eng.32 ] the place of the scripture which he read was this , he was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
[ eng.33 ] in his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
[ eng.34 ] and the eunuch answered philip , and said , i pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
[ eng.35 ] then philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him jesus .
[ eng.36 ] and as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , see , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
[ eng.37 ] and philip said , if thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest . and he answered and said , i believe that jesus christ is the son of god .
[ eng.38 ] and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
[ eng.39 ] and when they were come up out of the water , the spirit of the lord caught away philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
[ eng.40 ] but philip was found at azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to caesarea .
[ eng.1 ] and saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord , went unto the high priest ,
[ eng.2 ] and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto jerusalem .
[ eng.3 ] and as he journeyed , he came near damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
[ eng.4 ] and he fell to the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
[ eng.5 ] and he said , who art thou , lord ? and the lord said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
[ eng.6 ] and he trembling and astonished said , lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the lord said unto him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
[ eng.7 ] and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
[ eng.8 ] and saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into damascus .
[ eng.9 ] and he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink .
[ eng.10 ] and there was a certain disciple at damascus , named ananias ; and to him said the lord in a vision , ananias . and he said , behold , i am here , lord .
[ eng.11 ] and the lord said unto him , arise , and go into the street which is called straight , and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul , of tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth ,
[ eng.12 ] and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
[ eng.13 ] then ananias answered , lord , i have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem :
[ eng.14 ] and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
[ eng.15 ] but the lord said unto him , go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the gentiles , and kings , and the children of israel :
[ eng.16 ] for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name 's sake .
[ eng.17 ] and ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , brother saul , the lord , even jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the holy ghost .
[ eng.18 ] and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
[ eng.19 ] and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus .
[ eng.20 ] and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues , that he is the son of god .
[ eng.21 ] but all that heard him were amazed , and said ; is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
[ eng.22 ] but saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus , proving that this is very christ .
[ eng.23 ] and after that many days were fulfilled , the jews took counsel to kill him :
[ eng.24 ] but their laying await was known of saul . and they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
[ eng.25 ] then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
[ eng.26 ] and when saul was come to jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
[ eng.27 ] but barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus .
[ eng.28 ] and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem .
[ eng.29 ] and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus , and disputed against the grecians : but they went about to slay him .
[ eng.30 ] which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to caesarea , and sent him forth to tarsus .
[ eng.31 ] then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the lord , and in the comfort of the holy ghost , were multiplied .
[ eng.32 ] and it came to pass , as peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda .
[ eng.33 ] and there he found a certain man named aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
[ eng.34 ] and peter said unto him , aeneas , jesus christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . and he arose immediately .
[ eng.35 ] and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him , and turned to the lord .
[ eng.36 ] now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha , which by interpretation is called dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
[ eng.37 ] and it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
[ eng.38 ] and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa , and the disciples had heard that peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
[ eng.39 ] then peter arose and went with them . when he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made , while she was with them .
[ eng.40 ] but peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , tabitha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw peter , she sat up .
[ eng.41 ] and he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
[ eng.42 ] and it was known throughout all joppa ; and many believed in the lord .
[ eng.43 ] and it came to pass , that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner .
[ eng.1 ] there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius , a centurion of the band called the italian band ,
[ eng.2 ] a devout man , and one that feared god with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to god alway .
[ eng.3 ] he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him , and saying unto him , cornelius .
[ eng.4 ] and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , what is it , lord ? and he said unto him , thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god .
[ eng.5 ] and now send men to joppa , and call for one simon , whose surname is peter :
[ eng.6 ] he lodgeth with one simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do .
[ eng.7 ] and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
[ eng.8 ] and when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to joppa .
[ eng.9 ] on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
[ eng.10 ] and he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
[ eng.11 ] and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending upon him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
[ eng.12 ] wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
[ eng.13 ] and there came a voice to him , rise , peter ; kill , and eat .
[ eng.14 ] but peter said , not so , lord ; for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
[ eng.15 ] and the voice spake unto him again the second time , what god hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
[ eng.16 ] this was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
[ eng.17 ] now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
[ eng.18 ] and called , and asked whether simon , which was surnamed peter , were lodged there .
[ eng.19 ] while peter thought on the vision , the spirit said unto him , behold , three men seek thee .
[ eng.20 ] arise therefore , and get thee down , and go with them , doubting nothing : for i have sent them .
[ eng.21 ] then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius ; and said , behold , i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
[ eng.22 ] and they said , cornelius the centurion , a just man , and one that feareth god , and of good report among all the nation of the jews , was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house , and to hear words of thee .
[ eng.23 ] then called he them in , and lodged them . and on the morrow peter went away with them , and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him .
[ eng.24 ] and the morrow after they entered into caesarea . and cornelius waited for them , and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
[ eng.25 ] and as peter was coming in , cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
[ eng.26 ] but peter took him up , saying , stand up ; i myself also am a man .
[ eng.27 ] and as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
[ eng.28 ] and he said unto them , ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company , or come unto one of another nation ; but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean .
[ eng.29 ] therefore came i unto you without gainsaying , as soon as i was sent for : i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
[ eng.30 ] and cornelius said , four days ago i was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
[ eng.31 ] and said , cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god .
[ eng.32 ] send therefore to joppa , and call hither simon , whose surname is peter ; he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
[ eng.33 ] immediately therefore i sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before god , to hear all things that are commanded thee of god .
[ eng.34 ] then peter opened his mouth , and said , of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons :
[ eng.35 ] but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him .
[ eng.36 ] the word which god sent unto the children of israel , preaching peace by jesus christ : ( he is lord of all : )
[ eng.37 ] that word , i say , ye know , which was published throughout all judaea , and began from galilee , after the baptism which john preached ;
[ eng.38 ] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for god was with him .
[ eng.39 ] and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews , and in jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
[ eng.40 ] him god raised up the third day , and shewed him openly ;
[ eng.41 ] not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before god , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
[ eng.42 ] and he commanded us to preach unto the people , and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead .
[ eng.43 ] to him give all the prophets witness , that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins .
[ eng.44 ] while peter yet spake these words , the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
[ eng.45 ] and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with peter , because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost .
[ eng.46 ] for they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify god . then answered peter ,
[ eng.47 ] can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the holy ghost as well as we ?
[ eng.48 ] and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
[ eng.1 ] and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god .
[ eng.2 ] and when peter was come up to jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
[ eng.3 ] saying , thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
[ eng.4 ] but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying ,
[ eng.5 ] i was in the city of joppa praying : and in a trance i saw a vision , a certain vessel descend , as it had been a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me :
[ eng.6 ] upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes , i considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
[ eng.7 ] and i heard a voice saying unto me , arise , peter ; slay and eat .
[ eng.8 ] but i said , not so , lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
[ eng.9 ] but the voice answered me again from heaven , what god hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
[ eng.10 ] and this was done three times : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
[ eng.11 ] and , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was , sent from caesarea unto me .
[ eng.12 ] and the spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting . moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house :
[ eng.13 ] and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , send men to joppa , and call for simon , whose surname is peter ;
[ eng.14 ] who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
[ eng.15 ] and as i began to speak , the holy ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
[ eng.16 ] then remembered i the word of the lord , how that he said , john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost .
[ eng.17 ] forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the lord jesus christ ; what was i , that i could withstand god ?
[ eng.18 ] when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified god , saying , then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life .
[ eng.19 ] now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice , and cyprus , and antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the jews only .
[ eng.20 ] and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene , which , when they were come to antioch , spake unto the grecians , preaching the lord jesus .
[ eng.21 ] and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the lord .
[ eng.22 ] then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas , that he should go as far as antioch .
[ eng.23 ] who , when he came , and had seen the grace of god , was glad , and exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord .
[ eng.24 ] for he was a good man , and full of the holy ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
[ eng.25 ] then departed barnabas to tarsus , for to seek saul :
[ eng.26 ] and when he had found him , he brought him unto antioch . and it came to pass , that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church , and taught much people . and the disciples were called christians first in antioch .
[ eng.27 ] and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
[ eng.28 ] and there stood up one of them named agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar .
[ eng.29 ] then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea :
[ eng.30 ] which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul .
[ eng.1 ] now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
[ eng.2 ] and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
[ eng.3 ] and because he saw it pleased the jews , he proceeded further to take peter also . ( then were the days of unleavened bread . )
[ eng.4 ] and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after easter to bring him forth to the people .
[ eng.5 ] peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him .
[ eng.6 ] and when herod would have brought him forth , the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
[ eng.7 ] and , behold , the angel of the lord came upon him , and a light shined in the prison : and he smote peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , arise up quickly . and his chains fell off from his hands .
[ eng.8 ] and the angel said unto him , gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals . and so he did . and he saith unto him , cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
[ eng.9 ] and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
[ eng.10 ] when they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out , and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
[ eng.11 ] and when peter was come to himself , he said , now i know of a surety , that the lord hath sent his angel , and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the jews .
[ eng.12 ] and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of mary the mother of john , whose surname was mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
[ eng.13 ] and as peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named rhoda .
[ eng.14 ] and when she knew peter 's voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how peter stood before the gate .
[ eng.15 ] and they said unto her , thou art mad . but she constantly affirmed that it was even so . then said they , it is his angel .
[ eng.16 ] but peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
[ eng.17 ] but he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said , go shew these things unto james , and to the brethren . and he departed , and went into another place .
[ eng.18 ] now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of peter .
[ eng.19 ] and when herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from judaea to caesarea , and there abode .
[ eng.20 ] and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and , having made blastus the king 's chamberlain their friend , desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king 's country .
[ eng.21 ] and upon a set day herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
[ eng.22 ] and the people gave a shout , saying , it is the voice of a god , and not of a man .
[ eng.23 ] and immediately the angel of the lord smote him , because he gave not god the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
[ eng.24 ] but the word of god grew and multiplied .
[ eng.25 ] and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them john , whose surname was mark .
[ eng.1 ] now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as barnabas , and simeon that was called niger , and lucius of cyrene , and manaen , which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch , and saul .
[ eng.2 ] as they ministered to the lord , and fasted , the holy ghost said , separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
[ eng.3 ] and when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
[ eng.4 ] so they , being sent forth by the holy ghost , departed unto seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to cyprus .
[ eng.5 ] and when they were at salamis , they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john to their minister .
[ eng.6 ] and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a jew , whose name was barjesus :
[ eng.7 ] which was with the deputy of the country , sergius paulus , a prudent man ; who called for barnabas and saul , and desired to hear the word of god .
[ eng.8 ] but elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
[ eng.9 ] then saul , ( who also is called paul , ) filled with the holy ghost , set his eyes on him .
[ eng.10 ] and said , o full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord ?
[ eng.11 ] and now , behold , the hand of the lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
[ eng.12 ] then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the lord .
[ eng.13 ] now when paul and his company loosed from paphos , they came to perga in pamphylia : and john departing from them returned to jerusalem .
[ eng.14 ] but when they departed from perga , they came to antioch in pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
[ eng.15 ] and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
[ eng.16 ] then paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , men of israel , and ye that fear god , give audience .
[ eng.17 ] the god of this people of israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
[ eng.18 ] and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
[ eng.19 ] and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
[ eng.20 ] and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until samuel the prophet .
[ eng.21 ] and afterward they desired a king : and god gave unto them saul the son of cis , a man of the tribe of benjamin , by the space of forty years .
[ eng.22 ] and when he had removed him , he raised up unto them david to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimony , and said , i have found david the son of jesse , a man after mine own heart , which shall fulfil all my will .
[ eng.23 ] of this man 's seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour , jesus :
[ eng.24 ] when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
[ eng.25 ] and as john fulfilled his course , he said , whom think ye that i am ? i am not he . but , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose .
[ eng.26 ] men and brethren , children of the stock of abraham , and whosoever among you feareth god , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
[ eng.27 ] for they that dwell at jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
[ eng.28 ] and though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they pilate that he should be slain .
[ eng.29 ] and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
[ eng.30 ] but god raised him from the dead :
[ eng.31 ] and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
[ eng.32 ] and we declare unto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
[ eng.33 ] god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children , in that he hath raised up jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , thou art my son , this day have i begotten thee .
[ eng.34 ] and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , i will give you the sure mercies of david .
[ eng.35 ] wherefore he saith also in another psalm , thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
[ eng.36 ] for david , after he had served his own generation by the will of god , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
[ eng.37 ] but he , whom god raised again , saw no corruption .
[ eng.38 ] be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
[ eng.39 ] and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
[ eng.40 ] beware therefore , lest that come upon you , which is spoken of in the prophets ;
[ eng.41 ] behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for i work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
[ eng.42 ] and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue , the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
[ eng.43 ] now when the congregation was broken up , many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of god .
[ eng.44 ] and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god .
[ eng.45 ] but when the jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
[ eng.46 ] then paul and barnabas waxed bold , and said , it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the gentiles .
[ eng.47 ] for so hath the lord commanded us , saying , i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
[ eng.48 ] and when the gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
[ eng.49 ] and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region .
[ eng.50 ] but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against paul and barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
[ eng.51 ] but they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto iconium .
[ eng.52 ] and the disciples were filled with joy , and with the holy ghost .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass in iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed .
[ eng.2 ] but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
[ eng.3 ] long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
[ eng.4 ] but the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the jews , and part with the apostles .
[ eng.5 ] and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles , and also of the jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
[ eng.6 ] they were ware of it , and fled unto lystra and derbe , cities of lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
[ eng.7 ] and there they preached the gospel .
[ eng.8 ] and there sat a certain man at lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked :
[ eng.9 ] the same heard paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiving that he had faith to be healed ,
[ eng.10 ] said with a loud voice , stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped and walked .
[ eng.11 ] and when the people saw what paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of lycaonia , the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
[ eng.12 ] and they called barnabas , jupiter ; and paul , mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
[ eng.13 ] then the priest of jupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
[ eng.14 ] which when the apostles , barnabas and paul , heard of , they rent their clothes , and ran in among the people , crying out ,
[ eng.15 ] and saying , sirs , why do ye these things ? we also are men of like passions with you , and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god , which made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all things that are therein :
[ eng.16 ] who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
[ eng.17 ] nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
[ eng.18 ] and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
[ eng.19 ] and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium , who persuaded the people , and having stoned paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
[ eng.20 ] howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe .
[ eng.21 ] and when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned again to lystra , and to iconium , and antioch ,
[ eng.22 ] confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god .
[ eng.23 ] and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the lord , on whom they believed .
[ eng.24 ] and after they had passed throughout pisidia , they came to pamphylia .
[ eng.25 ] and when they had preached the word in perga , they went down into attalia :
[ eng.26 ] and thence sailed to antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled .
[ eng.27 ] and when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they rehearsed all that god had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles .
[ eng.28 ] and there they abode long time with the disciples .
[ eng.1 ] and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren , and said , except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses , ye cannot be saved .
[ eng.2 ] when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that paul and barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
[ eng.3 ] and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through phenice and samaria , declaring the conversion of the gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
[ eng.4 ] and when they were come to jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that god had done with them .
[ eng.5 ] but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed , saying , that it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of moses .
[ eng.6 ] and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
[ eng.7 ] and when there had been much disputing , peter rose up , and said unto them , men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us , that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
[ eng.8 ] and god , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the holy ghost , even as he did unto us ;
[ eng.9 ] and put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
[ eng.10 ] now therefore why tempt ye god , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
[ eng.11 ] but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved , even as they .
[ eng.12 ] then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to barnabas and paul , declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them .
[ eng.13 ] and after they had held their peace , james answered , saying , men and brethren , hearken unto me :
[ eng.14 ] simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
[ eng.15 ] and to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
[ eng.16 ] after this i will return , and will build again the tabernacle of david , which is fallen down ; and i will build again the ruins thereof , and i will set it up :
[ eng.17 ] that the residue of men might seek after the lord , and all the gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the lord , who doeth all these things .
[ eng.18 ] known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world .
[ eng.19 ] wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the gentiles are turned to god :
[ eng.20 ] but that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
[ eng.21 ] for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
[ eng.22 ] then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas ; namely , judas surnamed barsabas and silas , chief men among the brethren :
[ eng.23 ] and they wrote letters by them after this manner ; the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia .
[ eng.24 ] forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
[ eng.25 ] it seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
[ eng.26 ] men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ .
[ eng.27 ] we have sent therefore judas and silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
[ eng.28 ] for it seemed good to the holy ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
[ eng.29 ] that ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . fare ye well .
[ eng.30 ] so when they were dismissed , they came to antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
[ eng.31 ] which when they had read , they rejoiced for the consolation .
[ eng.32 ] and judas and silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
[ eng.33 ] and after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
[ eng.34 ] notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still .
[ eng.35 ] paul also and barnabas continued in antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the lord , with many others also .
[ eng.36 ] and some days after paul said unto barnabas , let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord , and see how they do .
[ eng.37 ] and barnabas determined to take with them john , whose surname was mark .
[ eng.38 ] but paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
[ eng.39 ] and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so barnabas took mark , and sailed unto cyprus ;
[ eng.40 ] and paul chose silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god .
[ eng.41 ] and he went through syria and cilicia , confirming the churches .
[ eng.1 ] then came he to derbe and lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a jewess , and believed ; but his father was a greek :
[ eng.2 ] which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium .
[ eng.3 ] him would paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a greek .
[ eng.4 ] and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem .
[ eng.5 ] and so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
[ eng.6 ] now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia , and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia ,
[ eng.7 ] after they were come to mysia , they assayed to go into bithynia : but the spirit suffered them not .
[ eng.8 ] and they passing by mysia came down to troas .
[ eng.9 ] and a vision appeared to paul in the night ; there stood a man of macedonia , and prayed him , saying , come over into macedonia , and help us .
[ eng.10 ] and after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia , assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
[ eng.11 ] therefore loosing from troas , we came with a straight course to samothracia , and the next day to neapolis ;
[ eng.12 ] and from thence to philippi , which is the chief city of that part of macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
[ eng.13 ] and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
[ eng.14 ] and a certain woman named lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of thyatira , which worshipped god , heard us : whose heart the lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul .
[ eng.15 ] and when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying , if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord , come into my house , and abide there . and she constrained us .
[ eng.16 ] and it came to pass , as we went to prayer , a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us , which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying :
[ eng.17 ] the same followed paul and us , and cried , saying , these men are the servants of the most high god , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
[ eng.18 ] and this did she many days . but paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
[ eng.19 ] and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught paul and silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
[ eng.20 ] and brought them to the magistrates , saying , these men , being jews , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
[ eng.21 ] and teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being romans .
[ eng.22 ] and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
[ eng.23 ] and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
[ eng.24 ] who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
[ eng.25 ] and at midnight paul and silas prayed , and sang praises unto god : and the prisoners heard them .
[ eng.26 ] and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were loosed .
[ eng.27 ] and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
[ eng.28 ] but paul cried with a loud voice , saying , do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
[ eng.29 ] then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before paul and silas ,
[ eng.30 ] and brought them out , and said , sirs , what must i do to be saved ?
[ eng.31 ] and they said , believe on the lord jesus christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house .
[ eng.32 ] and they spake unto him the word of the lord , and to all that were in his house .
[ eng.33 ] and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
[ eng.34 ] and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in god with all his house .
[ eng.35 ] and when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , let those men go .
[ eng.36 ] and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul , the magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore depart , and go in peace .
[ eng.37 ] but paul said unto them , they have beaten us openly uncondemned , being romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out privily ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
[ eng.38 ] and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were romans .
[ eng.39 ] and they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
[ eng.40 ] and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of lydia : and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
[ eng.1 ] now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia , they came to thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the jews :
[ eng.2 ] and paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
[ eng.3 ] opening and alleging , that christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this jesus , whom i preach unto you , is christ .
[ eng.4 ] and some of them believed , and consorted with paul and silas ; and of the devout greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
[ eng.5 ] but the jews which believed not , moved with envy , took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the city on an uproar , and assaulted the house of jason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
[ eng.6 ] and when they found them not , they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city , crying , these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ;
[ eng.7 ] whom jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar , saying that there is another king , one jesus .
[ eng.8 ] and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
[ eng.9 ] and when they had taken security of jason , and of the other , they let them go .
[ eng.10 ] and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews .
[ eng.11 ] these were more noble than those in thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so .
[ eng.12 ] therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were greeks , and of men , not a few .
[ eng.13 ] but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
[ eng.14 ] and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea : but silas and timotheus abode there still .
[ eng.15 ] and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens : and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
[ eng.16 ] now while paul waited for them at athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
[ eng.17 ] therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
[ eng.18 ] then certain philosophers of the epicureans , and of the stoicks , encountered him . and some said , what will this babbler say ? other some , he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached unto them jesus , and the resurrection .
[ eng.19 ] and they took him , and brought him unto areopagus , saying , may we know what this new doctrine , whereof thou speakest , is ?
[ eng.20 ] for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .
[ eng.21 ] ( for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
[ eng.22 ] then paul stood in the midst of mars ' hill , and said , ye men of athens , i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
[ eng.23 ] for as i passed by , and beheld your devotions , i found an altar with this inscription , to the unknown god . whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare i unto you .
[ eng.24 ] god that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
[ eng.25 ] neither is worshipped with men 's hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
[ eng.26 ] and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
[ eng.27 ] that they should seek the lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
[ eng.28 ] for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , for we are also his offspring .
[ eng.29 ] forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god , we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man 's device .
[ eng.30 ] and the times of this ignorance god winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
[ eng.31 ] because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
[ eng.32 ] and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , we will hear thee again of this matter .
[ eng.33 ] so paul departed from among them .
[ eng.34 ] howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was dionysius the areopagite , and a woman named damaris , and others with them .
[ eng.1 ] after these things paul departed from athens , and came to corinth ;
[ eng.2 ] and found a certain jew named aquila , born in pontus , lately come from italy , with his wife priscilla ; ( because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome : ) and came unto them .
[ eng.3 ] and because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
[ eng.4 ] and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the jews and the greeks .
[ eng.5 ] and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia , paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the jews that jesus was christ .
[ eng.6 ] and when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , your blood be upon your own heads ; i am clean ; from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles .
[ eng.7 ] and he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named justus , one that worshipped god , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
[ eng.8 ] and crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the lord with all his house ; and many of the corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
[ eng.9 ] then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision , be not afraid , but speak , and hold not thy peace :
[ eng.10 ] for i am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for i have much people in this city .
[ eng.11 ] and he continued there a year and six months , teaching the word of god among them .
[ eng.12 ] and when gallio was the deputy of achaia , the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
[ eng.13 ] saying , this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law .
[ eng.14 ] and when paul was now about to open his mouth , gallio said unto the jews , if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , o ye jews , reason would that i should bear with you :
[ eng.15 ] but if it be a question of words and names , and of your law , look ye to it ; for i will be no judge of such matters .
[ eng.16 ] and he drave them from the judgment seat .
[ eng.17 ] then all the greeks took sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and gallio cared for none of those things .
[ eng.18 ] and paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into syria , and with him priscilla and aquila ; having shorn his head in cenchrea : for he had a vow .
[ eng.19 ] and he came to ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the jews .
[ eng.20 ] when they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ;
[ eng.21 ] but bade them farewell , saying , i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem : but i will return again unto you , if god will . and he sailed from ephesus .
[ eng.22 ] and when he had landed at caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to antioch .
[ eng.23 ] and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
[ eng.24 ] and a certain jew named apollos , born at alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to ephesus .
[ eng.25 ] this man was instructed in the way of the lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord , knowing only the baptism of john .
[ eng.26 ] and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when aquila and priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly .
[ eng.27 ] and when he was disposed to pass into achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
[ eng.28 ] for he mightily convinced the jews , and that publickly , shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that , while apollos was at corinth , paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
[ eng.2 ] he said unto them , have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him , we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost .
[ eng.3 ] and he said unto them , unto what then were ye baptized ? and they said , unto john 's baptism .
[ eng.4 ] then said paul , john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on christ jesus .
[ eng.5 ] when they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
[ eng.6 ] and when paul had laid his hands upon them , the holy ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
[ eng.7 ] and all the men were about twelve .
[ eng.8 ] and he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god .
[ eng.9 ] but when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus .
[ eng.10 ] and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus , both jews and greeks .
[ eng.11 ] and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul :
[ eng.12 ] so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
[ eng.13 ] then certain of the vagabond jews , exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus , saying , we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth .
[ eng.14 ] and there were seven sons of one sceva , a jew , and chief of the priests , which did so .
[ eng.15 ] and the evil spirit answered and said , jesus i know , and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
[ eng.16 ] and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overcame them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
[ eng.17 ] and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the lord jesus was magnified .
[ eng.18 ] and many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .
[ eng.19 ] many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
[ eng.20 ] so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed .
[ eng.21 ] after these things were ended , paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through macedonia and achaia , to go to jerusalem , saying , after i have been there , i must also see rome .
[ eng.22 ] so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , timotheus and erastus ; but he himself stayed in asia for a season .
[ eng.23 ] and the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
[ eng.24 ] for a certain man named demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
[ eng.25 ] whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation , and said , sirs , ye know that by this craft we have our wealth .
[ eng.26 ] moreover ye see and hear , that not alone at ephesus , but almost throughout all asia , this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people , saying that they be no gods , which are made with hands :
[ eng.27 ] so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought ; but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised , and her magnificence should be destroyed , whom all asia and the world worshippeth .
[ eng.28 ] and when they heard these sayings , they were full of wrath , and cried out , saying , great is diana of the ephesians .
[ eng.29 ] and the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught gaius and aristarchus , men of macedonia , paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
[ eng.30 ] and when paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
[ eng.31 ] and certain of the chief of asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
[ eng.32 ] some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused : and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
[ eng.33 ] and they drew alexander out of the multitude , the jews putting him forward . and alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
[ eng.34 ] but when they knew that he was a jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , great is diana of the ephesians .
[ eng.35 ] and when the townclerk had appeased the people , he said , ye men of ephesus , what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana , and of the image which fell down from jupiter ?
[ eng.36 ] seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rashly .
[ eng.37 ] for ye have brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddess .
[ eng.38 ] wherefore if demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
[ eng.39 ] but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
[ eng.40 ] for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
[ eng.41 ] and when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
[ eng.1 ] and after the uproar was ceased , paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into macedonia .
[ eng.2 ] and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into greece ,
[ eng.3 ] and there abode three months . and when the jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into syria , he purposed to return through macedonia .
[ eng.4 ] and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea ; and of the thessalonians , aristarchus and secundus ; and gaius of derbe , and timotheus ; and of asia , tychicus and trophimus .
[ eng.5 ] these going before tarried for us at troas .
[ eng.6 ] and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
[ eng.7 ] and upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
[ eng.8 ] and there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
[ eng.9 ] and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
[ eng.10 ] and paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
[ eng.11 ] when he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
[ eng.12 ] and they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
[ eng.13 ] and we went before to ship , and sailed unto assos , there intending to take in paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
[ eng.14 ] and when he met with us at assos , we took him in , and came to mitylene .
[ eng.15 ] and we sailed thence , and came the next day over against chios ; and the next day we arrived at samos , and tarried at trogyllium ; and the next day we came to miletus .
[ eng.16 ] for paul had determined to sail by ephesus , because he would not spend the time in asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost .
[ eng.17 ] and from miletus he sent to ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
[ eng.18 ] and when they were come to him , he said unto them , ye know , from the first day that i came into asia , after what manner i have been with you at all seasons ,
[ eng.19 ] serving the lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews :
[ eng.20 ] and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
[ eng.21 ] testifying both to the jews , and also to the greeks , repentance toward god , and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
[ eng.22 ] and now , behold , i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
[ eng.23 ] save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
[ eng.24 ] but none of these things move me , neither count i my life dear unto myself , so that i might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which i have received of the lord jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of god .
[ eng.25 ] and now , behold , i know that ye all , among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god , shall see my face no more .
[ eng.26 ] wherefore i take you to record this day , that i am pure from the blood of all men .
[ eng.27 ] for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god .
[ eng.28 ] take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of god , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
[ eng.29 ] for i know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
[ eng.30 ] also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
[ eng.31 ] therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
[ eng.32 ] and now , brethren , i commend you to god , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up , and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified .
[ eng.33 ] i have coveted no man 's silver , or gold , or apparel .
[ eng.34 ] yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
[ eng.35 ] i have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the lord jesus , how he said , it is more blessed to give than to receive .
[ eng.36 ] and when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
[ eng.37 ] and they all wept sore , and fell on paul 's neck , and kissed him ,
[ eng.38 ] sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him unto the ship .
[ eng.1 ] and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto coos , and the day following unto rhodes , and from thence unto patara :
[ eng.2 ] and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
[ eng.3 ] now when we had discovered cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into syria , and landed at tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
[ eng.4 ] and finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to paul through the spirit , that he should not go up to jerusalem .
[ eng.5 ] and when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
[ eng.6 ] and when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
[ eng.7 ] and when we had finished our course from tyre , we came to ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
[ eng.8 ] and the next day we that were of paul 's company departed , and came unto caesarea : and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
[ eng.9 ] and the same man had four daughters , virgins , which did prophesy .
[ eng.10 ] and as we tarried there many days , there came down from judaea a certain prophet , named agabus .
[ eng.11 ] and when he was come unto us , he took paul 's girdle , and bound his own hands and feet , and said , thus saith the holy ghost , so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle , and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles .
[ eng.12 ] and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
[ eng.13 ] then paul answered , what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart ? for i am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus .
[ eng.14 ] and when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , the will of the lord be done .
[ eng.15 ] and after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to jerusalem .
[ eng.16 ] there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea , and brought with them one mnason of cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
[ eng.17 ] and when we were come to jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
[ eng.18 ] and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
[ eng.19 ] and when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry .
[ eng.20 ] and when they heard it , they glorified the lord , and said unto him , thou seest , brother , how many thousands of jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
[ eng.21 ] and they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
[ eng.22 ] what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
[ eng.23 ] do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vow on them ;
[ eng.24 ] them take , and purify thyself with them , and be at charges with them , that they may shave their heads : and all may know that those things , whereof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law .
[ eng.25 ] as touching the gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
[ eng.26 ] then paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
[ eng.27 ] and when the seven days were almost ended , the jews which were of asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
[ eng.28 ] crying out , men of israel , help : this is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
[ eng.29 ] ( for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian , whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple . )
[ eng.30 ] and all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
[ eng.31 ] and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all jerusalem was in an uproar .
[ eng.32 ] who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of paul .
[ eng.33 ] then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
[ eng.34 ] and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
[ eng.35 ] and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
[ eng.36 ] for the multitude of the people followed after , crying , away with him .
[ eng.37 ] and as paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , may i speak unto thee ? who said , canst thou speak greek ?
[ eng.38 ] art not thou that egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
[ eng.39 ] but paul said , i am a man which am a jew of tarsus , a city in cilicia , a citizen of no mean city : and , i beseech thee , suffer me to speak unto the people .
[ eng.40 ] and when he had given him licence , paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue , saying ,
[ eng.1 ] men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which i make now unto you .
[ eng.2 ] ( and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
[ eng.3 ] i am verily a man which am a jew , born in tarsus , a city in cilicia , yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous toward god , as ye all are this day .
[ eng.4 ] and i persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
[ eng.5 ] as also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also i received letters unto the brethren , and went to damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem , for to be punished .
[ eng.6 ] and it came to pass , that , as i made my journey , and was come nigh unto damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
[ eng.7 ] and i fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
[ eng.8 ] and i answered , who art thou , lord ? and he said unto me , i am jesus of nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
[ eng.9 ] and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
[ eng.10 ] and i said , what shall i do , lord ? and the lord said unto me , arise , and go into damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
[ eng.11 ] and when i could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , i came into damascus .
[ eng.12 ] and one ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there ,
[ eng.13 ] came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , brother saul , receive thy sight . and the same hour i looked up upon him .
[ eng.14 ] and he said , the god of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that just one , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
[ eng.15 ] for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
[ eng.16 ] and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the lord .
[ eng.17 ] and it came to pass , that , when i was come again to jerusalem , even while i prayed in the temple , i was in a trance ;
[ eng.18 ] and saw him saying unto me , make haste , and get thee quickly out of jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
[ eng.19 ] and i said , lord , they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
[ eng.20 ] and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed , i also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
[ eng.21 ] and he said unto me , depart : for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles .
[ eng.22 ] and they gave him audience unto this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live .
[ eng.23 ] and as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
[ eng.24 ] the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
[ eng.25 ] and as they bound him with thongs , paul said unto the centurion that stood by , is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman , and uncondemned ?
[ eng.26 ] when the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , take heed what thou doest : for this man is a roman .
[ eng.27 ] then the chief captain came , and said unto him , tell me , art thou a roman ? he said , yea .
[ eng.28 ] and the chief captain answered , with a great sum obtained i this freedom . and paul said , but i was free born .
[ eng.29 ] then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a roman , and because he had bound him .
[ eng.30 ] on the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought paul down , and set him before them .
[ eng.1 ] and paul , earnestly beholding the council , said , men and brethren , i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day .
[ eng.2 ] and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
[ eng.3 ] then said paul unto him , god shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
[ eng.4 ] and they that stood by said , revilest thou god 's high priest ?
[ eng.5 ] then said paul , i wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
[ eng.6 ] but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees , and the other pharisees , he cried out in the council , men and brethren , i am a pharisee , the son of a pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question .
[ eng.7 ] and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
[ eng.8 ] for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit : but the pharisees confess both .
[ eng.9 ] and there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the pharisees ' part arose , and strove , saying , we find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against god .
[ eng.10 ] and when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
[ eng.11 ] and the night following the lord stood by him , and said , be of good cheer , paul : for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at rome .
[ eng.12 ] and when it was day , certain of the jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul .
[ eng.13 ] and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
[ eng.14 ] and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , we have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul .
[ eng.15 ] now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow , as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or ever he come near , are ready to kill him .
[ eng.16 ] and when paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told paul .
[ eng.17 ] then paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
[ eng.18 ] so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
[ eng.19 ] then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , what is that thou hast to tell me ?
[ eng.20 ] and he said , the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council , as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
[ eng.21 ] but do not thou yield unto them : for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men , which have bound themselves with an oath , that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready , looking for a promise from thee .
[ eng.22 ] so the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
[ eng.23 ] and he called unto him two centurions , saying , make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearmen two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
[ eng.24 ] and provide them beasts , that they may set paul on , and bring him safe unto felix the governor .
[ eng.25 ] and he wrote a letter after this manner :
[ eng.26 ] claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting .
[ eng.27 ] this man was taken of the jews , and should have been killed of them : then came i with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a roman .
[ eng.28 ] and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , i brought him forth into their council :
[ eng.29 ] whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
[ eng.30 ] and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man , i sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
[ eng.31 ] then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took paul , and brought him by night to antipatris .
[ eng.32 ] on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
[ eng.33 ] who , when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented paul also before him .
[ eng.34 ] and when the governor had read the letter , he asked of what province he was . and when he understood that he was of cilicia ;
[ eng.35 ] i will hear thee , said he , when thine accusers are also come . and he commanded him to be kept in herod 's judgment hall .
[ eng.1 ] and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named tertullus , who informed the governor against paul .
[ eng.2 ] and when he was called forth , tertullus began to accuse him , saying , seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness , and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence ,
[ eng.3 ] we accept it always , and in all places , most noble felix , with all thankfulness .
[ eng.4 ] notwithstanding , that i be not further tedious unto thee , i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
[ eng.5 ] for we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes :
[ eng.6 ] who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
[ eng.7 ] but the chief captain lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands ,
[ eng.8 ] commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
[ eng.9 ] and the jews also assented , saying that these things were so .
[ eng.10 ] then paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , i do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
[ eng.11 ] because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship .
[ eng.12 ] and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
[ eng.13 ] neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
[ eng.14 ] but this i confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship i the god of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
[ eng.15 ] and have hope toward god , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
[ eng.16 ] and herein do i exercise myself , to have always a conscience void to offence toward god , and toward men .
[ eng.17 ] now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
[ eng.18 ] whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
[ eng.19 ] who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
[ eng.20 ] or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while i stood before the council ,
[ eng.21 ] except it be for this one voice , that i cried standing among them , touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day .
[ eng.22 ] and when felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , when lysias the chief captain shall come down , i will know the uttermost of your matter .
[ eng.23 ] and he commanded a centurion to keep paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
[ eng.24 ] and after certain days , when felix came with his wife drusilla , which was a jewess , he sent for paul , and heard him concerning the faith in christ .
[ eng.25 ] and as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , felix trembled , and answered , go thy way for this time ; when i have a convenient season , i will call for thee .
[ eng.26 ] he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
[ eng.27 ] but after two years porcius festus came into felix ' room : and felix , willing to shew the jews a pleasure , left paul bound .
[ eng.1 ] now when festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem .
[ eng.2 ] then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul , and besought him ,
[ eng.3 ] and desired favour against him , that he would send for him to jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
[ eng.4 ] but festus answered , that paul should be kept at caesarea , and that he himself would depart shortly thither .
[ eng.5 ] let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him .
[ eng.6 ] and when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought .
[ eng.7 ] and when he was come , the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against paul , which they could not prove .
[ eng.8 ] while he answered for himself , neither against the law of the jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against caesar , have i offended any thing at all .
[ eng.9 ] but festus , willing to do the jews a pleasure , answered paul , and said , wilt thou go up to jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
[ eng.10 ] then said paul , i stand at caesar 's judgment seat , where i ought to be judged : to the jews have i done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
[ eng.11 ] for if i be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , i refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . i appeal unto caesar .
[ eng.12 ] then festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , hast thou appealed unto caesar ? unto caesar shalt thou go .
[ eng.13 ] and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus .
[ eng.14 ] and when they had been there many days , festus declared paul 's cause unto the king , saying , there is a certain man left in bonds by felix :
[ eng.15 ] about whom , when i was at jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
[ eng.16 ] to whom i answered , it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die , before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face , and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him .
[ eng.17 ] therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
[ eng.18 ] against whom when the accusers stood up , they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed :
[ eng.19 ] but had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one jesus , which was dead , whom paul affirmed to be alive .
[ eng.20 ] and because i doubted of such manner of questions , i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
[ eng.21 ] but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus , i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar .
[ eng.22 ] then agrippa said unto festus , i would also hear the man myself . to morrow , said he , thou shalt hear him .
[ eng.23 ] and on the morrow , when agrippa was come , and bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at festus ' commandment paul was brought forth .
[ eng.24 ] and festus said , king agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me , both at jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
[ eng.25 ] but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to augustus , i have determined to send him .
[ eng.26 ] of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord . wherefore i have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , o king agrippa , that , after examination had , i might have somewhat to write .
[ eng.27 ] for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
[ eng.1 ] then agrippa said unto paul , thou art permitted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
[ eng.2 ] i think myself happy , king agrippa , because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews :
[ eng.3 ] especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews : wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently .
[ eng.4 ] my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem , know all the jews ;
[ eng.5 ] which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee .
[ eng.6 ] and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god , unto our fathers :
[ eng.7 ] unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving god day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king agrippa , i am accused of the jews .
[ eng.8 ] why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that god should raise the dead ?
[ eng.9 ] i verily thought with myself , that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
[ eng.10 ] which thing i also did in jerusalem : and many of the saints did i shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , i gave my voice against them .
[ eng.11 ] and i punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , i persecuted them even unto strange cities .
[ eng.12 ] whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
[ eng.13 ] at midday , o king , i saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
[ eng.14 ] and when we were all fallen to the earth , i heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the hebrew tongue , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
[ eng.15 ] and i said , who art thou , lord ? and he said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
[ eng.16 ] but rise , and stand upon thy feet : for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee ;
[ eng.17 ] delivering thee from the people , and from the gentiles , unto whom now i send thee ,
[ eng.18 ] to open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of satan unto god , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
[ eng.19 ] whereupon , o king agrippa , i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
[ eng.20 ] but shewed first unto them of damascus , and at jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of judaea , and then to the gentiles , that they should repent and turn to god , and do works meet for repentance .
[ eng.21 ] for these causes the jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
[ eng.22 ] having therefore obtained help of god , i continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come :
[ eng.23 ] that christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the gentiles .
[ eng.24 ] and as he thus spake for himself , festus said with a loud voice , paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
[ eng.25 ] but he said , i am not mad , most noble festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
[ eng.26 ] for the king knoweth of these things , before whom also i speak freely : for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
[ eng.27 ] king agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? i know that thou believest .
[ eng.28 ] then agrippa said unto paul , almost thou persuadest me to be a christian .
[ eng.29 ] and paul said , i would to god , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as i am , except these bonds .
[ eng.30 ] and when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and bernice , and they that sat with them :
[ eng.31 ] and when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
[ eng.32 ] then said agrippa unto festus , this man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto caesar .
[ eng.1 ] and when it was determined that we should sail into italy , they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius , a centurion of augustus ' band .
[ eng.2 ] and entering into a ship of adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of asia ; one aristarchus , a macedonian of thessalonica , being with us .
[ eng.3 ] and the next day we touched at sidon . and julius courteously entreated paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
[ eng.4 ] and when we had launched from thence , we sailed under cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
[ eng.5 ] and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia , we came to myra , a city of lycia .
[ eng.6 ] and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy ; and he put us therein .
[ eng.7 ] and when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under crete , over against salmone ;
[ eng.8 ] and , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called the fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of lasea .
[ eng.9 ] now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the fast was now already past , paul admonished them ,
[ eng.10 ] and said unto them , sirs , i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage , not only of the lading and ship , but also of our lives .
[ eng.11 ] nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by paul .
[ eng.12 ] and because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
[ eng.13 ] and when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by crete .
[ eng.14 ] but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called euroclydon .
[ eng.15 ] and when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
[ eng.16 ] and running under a certain island which is called clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
[ eng.17 ] which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
[ eng.18 ] and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest , the next day they lightened the ship ;
[ eng.19 ] and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
[ eng.20 ] and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
[ eng.21 ] but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
[ eng.22 ] and now i exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
[ eng.23 ] for there stood by me this night the angel of god , whose i am , and whom i serve ,
[ eng.24 ] saying , fear not , paul ; thou must be brought before caesar : and , lo , god hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
[ eng.25 ] wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for i believe god , that it shall be even as it was told me .
[ eng.26 ] howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island .
[ eng.27 ] but when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
[ eng.28 ] and sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
[ eng.29 ] then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
[ eng.30 ] and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
[ eng.31 ] paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saved .
[ eng.32 ] then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
[ eng.33 ] and while the day was coming on , paul besought them all to take meat , saying , this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
[ eng.34 ] wherefore i pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
[ eng.35 ] and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to god in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
[ eng.36 ] then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
[ eng.37 ] and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
[ eng.38 ] and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
[ eng.39 ] and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
[ eng.40 ] and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
[ eng.41 ] and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
[ eng.42 ] and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
[ eng.43 ] but the centurion , willing to save paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
[ eng.44 ] and the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
[ eng.1 ] and when they were escaped , then they knew that the island was called melita .
[ eng.2 ] and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
[ eng.3 ] and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
[ eng.4 ] and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , no doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
[ eng.5 ] and he shook off the beast into the fire , and felt no harm .
[ eng.6 ] howbeit they looked when he should have swollen , or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while , and saw no harm come to him , they changed their minds , and said that he was a god .
[ eng.7 ] in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
[ eng.8 ] and it came to pass , that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
[ eng.9 ] so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
[ eng.10 ] who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed , they laded us with such things as were necessary .
[ eng.11 ] and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria , which had wintered in the isle , whose sign was castor and pollux .
[ eng.12 ] and landing at syracuse , we tarried there three days .
[ eng.13 ] and from thence we fetched a compass , and came to rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to puteoli :
[ eng.14 ] where we found brethren , and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward rome .
[ eng.15 ] and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as appii forum , and the three taverns : whom when paul saw , he thanked god , and took courage .
[ eng.16 ] and when we came to rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
[ eng.17 ] and it came to pass , that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together : and when they were come together , he said unto them , men and brethren , though i have committed nothing against the people , or customs of our fathers , yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans .
[ eng.18 ] who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
[ eng.19 ] but when the jews spake against it , i was constrained to appeal unto caesar ; not that i had ought to accuse my nation of .
[ eng.20 ] for this cause therefore have i called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain .
[ eng.21 ] and they said unto him , we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee , neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee .
[ eng.22 ] but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , we know that every where it is spoken against .
[ eng.23 ] and when they had appointed him a day , there came many to him into his lodging ; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god , persuading them concerning jesus , both out of the law of moses , and out of the prophets , from morning till evening .
[ eng.24 ] and some believed the things which were spoken , and some believed not .
[ eng.25 ] and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that paul had spoken one word , well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
[ eng.26 ] saying , go unto this people , and say , hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and not perceive :
[ eng.27 ] for the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and i should heal them .
[ eng.28 ] be it known therefore unto you , that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles , and that they will hear it .
[ eng.29 ] and when he had said these words , the jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
[ eng.30 ] and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house , and received all that came in unto him ,
[ eng.31 ] preaching the kingdom of god , and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ , with all confidence , no man forbidding him .
