and they returned, and prepared spi@@ ces and oint@@ ments ; and re@@ sted the sabbath day according to the commandment .
now upon the first day of the week, very early in the mor@@ ning, they came unto the sepulchre, bring@@ ing the spi@@ ces which they had prepa@@ red, and certain others with them .
and they found the stone ro@@ lled away from the sepulchre .
and they entered in, and found not the body of the lord jesus .
and it came to pass, as they were much per@@ ple@@ xed there@@ about, behold, two men stood by them in shi@@ ning garments :
and as they were afrai@@ d, and bo@@ wed down their fa@@ ces to the earth, they said unto them, why seek ye the living among the dead ?
he is not here, but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
saying, the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sin@@ ful men, and be cruci@@ fied, and the third day rise again .
and they remembered his words ,
and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the ele@@ ven, and to all the rest .
it was mary magdalene and jo@@ an@@ na, and mary the mother of james, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles .
and their words seemed to them as i@@ dle tal@@ es, and they believed them not .
then arose peter, and ran unto the sepulchre ; and sto@@ op@@ ing down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wond@@ ering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called e@@ m@@ ma@@ us, which was from jerusalem about thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e fur@@ lon@@ gs .
and they talked together of all these things which had ha@@ pp@@ ened .
and it came to pass, that, while they comm@@ un@@ ed together and reas@@ on@@ ed, jesus himself drew near, and went with them .
but their eyes were ho@@ l@@ den that they should not know him .
and he said unto them, what manner of comm@@ un@@ i@@ ca@@ tions are these that ye have one to another, as ye wal@@ k, and are sa@@ d ?
and the one of them, whose name was cle@@ o@@ pa@@ s, answering said unto him, art thou only a str@@ anger in jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
and he said unto them, what things ? and they said unto him, concerning jesus of nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in de@@ ed and word before god and all the people :
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him .
but we tru@@ sted that it had been he which should have re@@ dee@@ med israel : and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done .
yea, and certain women also of our company made us astoni@@ shed, which were early at the sepulchre ;
and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of ange@@ ls, which said that he was a@@ live .
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
then he said unto them, o foo@@ ls, and s@@ low of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
ought not christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory ?
and beginning at moses and all the prophets, he ex@@ p@@ ounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
and they drew nigh unto the villa@@ ge, whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
but they con@@ strained him, saying, abide with us : for it is toward even@@ ing, and the day is far sp@@ ent . and he went in to tarry with them .
and it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and bra@@ ke, and gave to them .
and their eyes were opened, and they knew him ; and he van@@ ished out of their sight .
and they said one to another, did not our heart bur@@ n within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
and they rose up the same hour, and returned to jerusalem, and found the ele@@ ven gathered together, and them that were with them ,
saying, the lord is risen inde@@ ed, and hath appeared to simon .
and they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in brea@@ king of bread .
and as they thus spake, jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, peace be unto you .
but they were ter@@ ri@@ fied and af@@ fri@@ gh@@ ted, and suppo@@ sed that they had seen a spirit .
and he said unto them, why are ye troubled ? and why do though@@ ts arise in your hearts ?
behold my hands and my feet, that it is i myself : han@@ dle me, and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bon@@ es, as ye see me have .
and when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet .
and while they yet believed not for jo@@ y, and won@@ de@@ red, he said unto them, have ye here any meat ?
and they gave him a piece of a bro@@ i@@ led fi@@ s@@ h, and of an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
and he took it, and did eat before them .
and he said unto them, these are the words which i spake unto you, while i was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of moses, and in the prophets, and in the p@@ sal@@ ms, concerning me .
then opened he their under@@ standing, that they might understand the scriptures ,
and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it beho@@ ved christ to suf@@ f@@ er, and to rise from the dead the third day :
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all na@@ tions, beginning at jerusalem .
and ye are witnesses of these things .
and, behold, i send the promise of my father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem, until ye be en@@ du@@ ed with power from on high .
and he led them out as far as to bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them .
and it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven .
and they worshipped him, and returned to jerusalem with great joy :
and were continu@@ al@@ ly in the temple, praising and bles@@ sing god . a@@ men
the for@@ me@@ r trea@@ ti@@ se have i ma@@ de, o the@@ op@@ hi@@ l@@ us, of all that jesus began both to do and teach ,
until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he shewed himself a@@ live after his pas@@ sion by many in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble pro@@ of@@ s, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things per@@ tain@@ ing to the kingdom of god :
and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me .
for john truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence .
when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, lord, wilt thou at this time re@@ stor@@ e again the kingdom to israel ?
and he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seas@@ ons, which the father hath put in his own power .
but ye shall receive power, after that the holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem, and in all judaea, and in samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
and when he had spoken these things, while they be@@ he@@ ld, he was taken up ; and a c@@ loud received him out of their sight .
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white ap@@ pa@@ re@@ l ;
which also said, ye men of galilee, why stand ye ga@@ z@@ ing up into heaven ? this same jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called oli@@ ve@@ t, which is from jerusalem a sabbath day 's journe@@ y .
and when they were come in, they went up into an upper roo@@ m, where abode both peter, and james, and john, and and@@ re@@ w, philip, and thomas, bar@@ tho@@ lo@@ me@@ w, and mat@@ the@@ w, james the son of al@@ pha@@ eus, and simon ze@@ lo@@ tes, and judas the brother of james .
these all continued with one accord in prayer and sup@@ pli@@ ca@@ tion, with the women, and mary the mother of jesus, and with his brethren .
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said,
men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas, which was gu@@ ide to them that took jesus .
for he was nu@@ mbered with us, and had ob@@ ta@@ ined part of this mini@@ st@@ ry .
now this man pur@@ cha@@ sed a field with the reward of iniquity ; and fal@@ ling hea@@ d@@ lon@@ g, he bur@@ st as@@ under in the midst, and all his bo@@ we@@ ls gu@@ shed out .
and it was known unto all the dwel@@ l@@ ers at jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their pro@@ per tongu@@ e, a@@ ce@@ l@@ da@@ ma@@ , that is to say, the field of blood .
for it is written in the book of p@@ sal@@ ms, let his ha@@ bi@@ tation be deso@@ la@@ te, and let no man dwell therein : and his b@@ is@@ ho@@ pri@@ ck let another take .
wherefore of these men which have comp@@ ani@@ ed with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us ,
beginning from the baptism of john, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and they appointed t@@ wo@@ , joseph called bar@@ sa@@ bas, who was surnamed ju@@ st@@ us, and mat@@ thi@@ as .
and they prayed, and said, thou, lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
that he may take part of this mini@@ st@@ ry and apost@@ les@@ hi@@ p, from which judas by transgre@@ s@@ sion fe@@ ll, that he might go to his own place .
and they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon mat@@ thi@@ as ; and he was nu@@ mbered with the ele@@ ven apostles .
and when the day of p@@ ente@@ co@@ st was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place .
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a ru@@ shi@@ ng mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared unto them clo@@ ven tongu@@ es like as of fire, and it sat upon ea@@ ch of them .
and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongu@@ es, as the spirit gave them utter@@ ance .
and there were dwel@@ ling at jerusalem jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven .
now when this was no@@ ised abro@@ a@@ d, the multitude came together, and were con@@ foun@@ ded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and they were all amaz@@ ed and marvelled, saying one to another, behold, are not all these which speak galilae@@ ans ?
and how hear we every man in our own tongu@@ e, wherein we were born ?
par@@ thi@@ ans, and me@@ des, and e@@ la@@ mi@@ tes, and the dwel@@ l@@ ers in mes@@ o@@ po@@ ta@@ mi@@ a, and in judaea, and cap@@ pa@@ do@@ ci@@ a, in pon@@ tus, and asia ,
ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ a, and pa@@ mp@@ hy@@ li@@ a, in egypt, and in the par@@ ts of li@@ b@@ y@@ a about cy@@ ren@@ e, and strangers of ro@@ me, jews and pro@@ sel@@ y@@ tes ,
cre@@ tes and ar@@ abi@@ ans, we do hear them speak in our tongu@@ es the wond@@ er@@ ful works of god .
and they were all amazed, and were in doub@@ t, saying one to another, what me@@ an@@ eth this ?
others mo@@ c@@ king said, these men are full of new wine .
but peter, standing up with the ele@@ ven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, ye men of judaea, and all ye that dwell at jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words :
for these are not drun@@ ken, as ye suppo@@ se, seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet jo@@ el ;
and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith god, i will p@@ our out of my spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daugh@@ ters shall prophe@@ sy, and your young men shall see visi@@ ons, and your old men shall drea@@ m drea@@ ms :
and on my servants and on my han@@ d@@ mai@@ den@@ s i will p@@ our out in those days of my spirit ; and they shall prophe@@ sy :
and i will shew wonders in heaven abo@@ ve, and signs in the earth b@@ ene@@ a@@ th ; blood, and fire, and v@@ ap@@ our of s@@ mo@@ ke :
the sun shall be turned into dark@@ ness, and the mo@@ on into blood, before the great and no@@ table day of the lord come :
and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
ye men of israel, hear these words ; jesus of nazareth, a man ap@@ pro@@ ved of god among you by miracles and wonders and sig@@ ns, which god did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know :
him, being delivered by the deter@@ min@@ a@@ te counsel and fore@@ knowledge of god, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
whom god hath raised up, having loosed the pa@@ ins of death : because it was not possible that he should be ho@@ l@@ den of it .
for david speaketh concerning him, i fore@@ saw the lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that i should not be moved :
therefore did my heart rejoi@@ ce, and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
because thou wilt not leave my soul in he@@ ll, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corrup@@ tion .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy coun@@ ten@@ ance .
men and brethren, let me fre@@ e@@ ly speak unto you of the pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch david, that he is both dead and bu@@ ri@@ ed, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
therefore being a prophet, and knowing that god had s@@ wor@@ n with an oa@@ th to him, that of the fruit of his lo@@ in@@ s, according to the flesh, he would raise up christ to sit on his throne ;
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ, that his soul was not left in he@@ ll, neither his flesh did see corrup@@ tion .
this jesus hath god raised up, whereof we all are witnesses .
therefore being by the right hand of god exal@@ ted, and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear .
for david is not as@@ cen@@ ded into the heavens : but he saith himself, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand ,
until i make thy fo@@ es thy foo@@ tstool .
therefore let all the house of israel know as@@ sure@@ d@@ ly, that god hath made the same jesus, whom ye have cruci@@ fied, both lord and christ .
now when they heard this, they were pri@@ cked in their heart, and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do ?
then peter said unto them, repen@@ t, and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost .
for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the lord our god shall call .
and with many other words did he testify and exhor@@ t, saying, save yourselves from this un@@ toward generation .
then they that gla@@ dly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellow@@ ship, and in brea@@ king of bread, and in pray@@ ers .
and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
and all that believed were together, and had all things common ;
and sold their posses@@ sions and goo@@ ds, and parted them to all men, as every man had need .
and they, continu@@ ing daily with one accord in the temple, and brea@@ king bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gla@@ dness and s@@ ing@@ len@@ ess of heart ,
praising god, and having fav@@ our with all the people . and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of pray@@ er, being the ninth hour .
and a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was car@@ ri@@ ed, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms .
and peter, fast@@ en@@ ing his eyes upon him with john, said, look on us .
and he gave heed unto them, expe@@ c@@ ting to receive something of them .
then peter said, silver and go@@ ld have i none ; but such as i have give i thee : in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk .
and he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and an@@ k@@ le b@@ ones received streng@@ th .
and he lea@@ p@@ ing up stoo@@ d, and wal@@ ked, and entered with them into the temple, wal@@ king, and lea@@ p@@ ing, and praising god .
and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful gate of the temple : and they were filled with won@@ der and ama@@ ze@@ ment at that which had ha@@ pp@@ ened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john, all the people ran together unto them in the por@@ ch that is called solomon 's, greatly wond@@ ering .
and when peter saw it, he answered unto the people, ye men of israel, why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so ear@@ nes@@ tly on us, as though by our own power or ho@@ lin@@ ess we had made this man to walk ?
the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jaco@@ b, the god of our fathers, hath glorified his son jesus ; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of pilate, when he was determined to let him go .
but ye denied the holy one and the ju@@ st, and desired a murde@@ re@@ r to be gran@@ ted unto you ;
and killed the prince of life, whom god hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man str@@ on@@ g, whom ye see and know : yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect s@@ oun@@ dness in the presence of you all .
and now, brethren, i wo@@ t that through i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ye did it, as did also your rulers .
but those things, which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that christ should suf@@ f@@ er, he hath so fulfilled .
repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be b@@ lo@@ tted out, when the times of re@@ fre@@ shi@@ ng shall come from the presence of the lord .
and he shall send jesus christ, which before was preached unto you :
whom the heaven must receive until the times of re@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion of all things, which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for moses truly said unto the fathers, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
and it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destro@@ yed from among the people .
yea, and all the prophets from sa@@ mu@@ el and those that follow af@@ ter, as many as have spoken, have likewise fore@@ told of these days .
ye are the children of the prophets, and of the co@@ ven@@ ant which god made with our fathers, saying unto abraham, and in thy seed shall all the kind@@ re@@ ds of the earth be blessed .
unto you first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him to bles@@ s you, in tur@@ ning away every one of you from his iniqui@@ ties .
and as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadduce@@ es, came upon them ,
being grie@@ ved that they taught the people, and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead .
and they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now even@@ ti@@ de .
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
and it came to pass on the morrow, that their rul@@ ers, and elders, and scribes ,
and an@@ n@@ as the high priest, and caiapha@@ s, and john, and alex@@ and@@ er, and as many as were of the kind@@ red of the high priest, were gathered together at jerusalem .
and when they had set them in the midst, they aske@@ d, by what power, or by what name, have ye done this ?
then peter, filled with the holy ghost, said unto them, ye rulers of the people, and elders of israel ,
if we this day be exa@@ mined of the good de@@ ed done to the im@@ po@@ t@@ ent man, by what means he is made whole ;
be it known unto you all, and to all the people of israel, that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth, whom ye cruci@@ fied, whom god raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
this is the stone which was set at n@@ ought of you build@@ ers, which is become the head of the cor@@ ner .
neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men, where@@ by we must be saved .
now when they saw the bold@@ ness of peter and john, and perceived that they were un@@ lear@@ ned and i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant men, they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with jesus .
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they con@@ fer@@ red among themselves ,
saying, what shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a no@@ table miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
but that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly th@@ rea@@ ten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
but peter and john answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god, judge ye .
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
so when they had further th@@ rea@@ t@@ ened them, they let them go, fin@@ ding nothing how they might p@@ un@@ ish them, because of the people : for all men glorified god for that which was done .
for the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
and being let go, they went to their own comp@@ an@@ y, and re@@ por@@ ted all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
and when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to god with one accor@@ d, and said, lord, thou art god, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is :
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said, why did the hea@@ then ra@@ ge, and the people i@@ mag@@ ine va@@ in things ?
the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the lord, and against his christ .
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus, whom thou hast anoin@@ ted, both herod, and pon@@ ti@@ us pilate, with the gentiles, and the people of israel, were gathered together ,
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
and now, lord, behold their th@@ rea@@ ten@@ ings : and gran@@ t unto thy servants, that with all bold@@ ness they may speak thy word ,
by stret@@ ching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus .
and when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and they spake the word of god with bold@@ ness .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
neither was there any among them that la@@ cked : for as many as were posses@@ sor@@ s of lan@@ ds or hou@@ ses sold them, and brought the pri@@ ces of the things that were sold ,
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion was made unto every man according as he had need .
and jo@@ ses, who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas, a le@@ vi@@ te, and of the country of cyp@@ r@@ us ,
having land, sold it, and brought the mone@@ y, and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
but a certain man named anani@@ as, with sa@@ pp@@ hi@@ r@@ a his wife, sold a posses@@ sion ,
and kept back part of the pri@@ ce, his wife also being priv@@ y to it, and brought a certain par@@ t, and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
but peter said, anani@@ as, why hath satan filled thine heart to li@@ e to the holy ghost, and to keep back part of the pri@@ ce of the land ?
whi@@ les it rema@@ in@@ ed, was it not thine own ? and after it was so@@ ld, was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou con@@ cei@@ ved this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not li@@ ed unto men, but unto god .
and ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
and the young men arose, w@@ ound him up, and carried him out, and bu@@ ried him .
and it was about the space of three hou@@ rs af@@ ter, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in .
and peter answered unto her, tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ? and she said, yea, for so much .
then peter said unto her, how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord ? behold, the feet of them which have bu@@ ried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out .
then fell she down straightway at his feet, and y@@ i@@ eld@@ ed up the ghost : and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, car@@ rying her forth, bu@@ ried her by her husband .
and great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things .
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in solomon 's por@@ ch .
and of the rest du@@ rst no man jo@@ in himself to them : but the people mag@@ ni@@ fied them .
and belie@@ vers were the more added to the lord, multitudes both of men and women . )
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the stree@@ ts, and laid them on be@@ ds and c@@ ou@@ che@@ s, that at the least the shadow of peter pas@@ sing by might over@@ shadow some of them .
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem, bring@@ ing sick fol@@ ks, and them which were ve@@ xed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, and were filled with indi@@ g@@ nation ,
and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison .
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison do@@ or@@ s, and brought them forth, and said ,
go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
and when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the mor@@ ning, and taught . but the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the sen@@ a@@ te of the children of israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought .
but when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told ,
saying, the prison truly found we shut with all sa@@ fe@@ ty, and the kee@@ pers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened, we found no man within .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doub@@ ted of them whereunto this would g@@ row .
then came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people .
then went the captain with the officer@@ s, and brought them without viol@@ ence : for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned .
and when they had brought them, they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
saying, did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and, behold, ye have filled jerusalem with your doctr@@ in@@ e, and int@@ end to bring this man 's blood upon us .
then peter and the other apostles answered and said, we ought to obey god rather than men .
the god of our fathers raised up jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a sa@@ vi@@ our, for to give repentance to israel, and forgi@@ ven@@ ess of sins .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the holy ghost, whom god hath given to them that obey him .
when they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them .
then stood there up one in the council, a pharise@@ e, named ga@@ ma@@ lie@@ l, a doc@@ t@@ or of the law, had in re@@ pu@@ tation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;
and said unto them, ye men of israel, take heed to yourselves what ye int@@ end to do as touching these men .
for before these days rose up the@@ u@@ da@@ s, bo@@ ast@@ ing himself to be some@@ body ; to whom a number of men, about four hund@@ red, jo@@ ined themselves : who was slain ; and all, as many as obe@@ yed him, were scatte@@ red, and brought to n@@ ought .
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the ta@@ x@@ ing, and drew away much people after him : he also per@@ ished ; and all, even as many as obe@@ yed him, were disp@@ er@@ sed .
and now i say unto you, re@@ fra@@ in from these men, and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to n@@ ought :
but if it be of god, ye cannot over@@ th@@ row it ; lest ha@@ ply ye be found even to fi@@ ght against god .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles, and be@@ ate@@ n them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus, and let them go .
and they departed from the presence of the council, rejoi@@ c@@ ing that they were counted worthy to suffer sha@@ me for his name .
and daily in the temple, and in every house, they ce@@ ased not to teach and preach jesus christ .
and in those days, when the number of the disciples was multi@@ p@@ lie@@ d, there arose a mur@@ mur@@ ing of the gre@@ ci@@ ans against the hebre@@ w@@ s, because their widows were ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted in the daily mini@@ stra@@ tion .
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of god, and serve ta@@ b@@ les .
where@@ fore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of hon@@ est re@@ por@@ t, full of the holy ghost and wis@@ dom, whom we may appoin@@ t over this bu@@ sin@@ ess .
but we will give our@@ sel@@ ves continu@@ al@@ ly to pray@@ er, and to the mini@@ st@@ ry of the word .
and the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they cho@@ se stephe@@ n, a man full of faith and of the holy ghost, and philip, and pro@@ ch@@ or@@ us, and ni@@ can@@ or, and ti@@ mon, and par@@ men@@ as, and nico@@ l@@ as a pro@@ sel@@ y@@ te of antioch :
whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them .
and the word of god incre@@ ased ; and the number of the disciples multi@@ pli@@ ed in jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obe@@ di@@ ent to the faith .
and stephe@@ n, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people .
then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the liber@@ t@@ in@@ es, and cy@@ re@@ ni@@ ans, and alex@@ and@@ ri@@ ans, and of them of cilici@@ a and of asi@@ a, dispu@@ ting with stephe@@ n .
and they were not able to resi@@ st the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
then they su@@ bor@@ ned men, which said, we have heard him speak blasphe@@ m@@ ous words against moses, and against god .
and they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council ,
and set up false witnes@@ ses, which said, this man cea@@ seth not to speak blasphe@@ m@@ ous words against this holy place, and the law :
for we have heard him say, that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall chan@@ ge the custo@@ ms which moses delivered us .
and all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
then said the high priest, are these things so ?
and he said, men, brethren, and fathers, hearken ; the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham, when he was in mes@@ o@@ po@@ ta@@ mi@@ a, before he dwelt in char@@ ran ,
and said unto him, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kind@@ red, and come into the land which i shall shew thee .
then came he out of the land of the cha@@ l@@ da@@ e@@ ans, and dwelt in char@@ ran : and from thence, when his father was dead, he re@@ moved him into this land, wherein ye now dwell .
and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promi@@ sed that he would give it to him for a posses@@ sion, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child .
and god spake on this wise, that his seed should so@@ jour@@ n in a stran@@ ge land ; and that they should bring them into bon@@ da@@ ge, and en@@ tre@@ at them evil four hundred years .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bon@@ da@@ ge will i judge, said god : and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place .
and he gave him the co@@ ven@@ ant of circumci@@ sion : and so abraham begat isaac, and circumci@@ sed him the e@@ igh@@ th day ; and isa@@ a@@ c begat jacob ; and jacob begat the twelve pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch@@ s .
and the pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch@@ s, moved with en@@ v@@ y, sold joseph into egypt : but god was with him ,
and delivered him out of all his affli@@ c@@ tions, and gave him fav@@ our and wisdom in the sight of pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h king of egypt ; and he made him governor over egypt and all his house .
now there came a de@@ ar@@ th over all the land of egypt and chan@@ a@@ an, and great affli@@ ction : and our fathers found no su@@ st@@ en@@ ance .
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt, he sent out our fathers first .
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren ; and joseph 's kind@@ red was made known unto pha@@ ra@@ o@@ h .
then sent joseph, and called his father jacob to him, and all his kind@@ red, thre@@ es@@ cor@@ e and fif@@ teen souls .
so jacob went down into egypt, and di@@ ed, he, and our fathers ,
and were carried over into sy@@ che@@ m, and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a su@@ m of money of the sons of e@@ m@@ m@@ or the father of sy@@ che@@ m .
but when the time of the promise drew nigh@@ , which god had s@@ wor@@ n to abraham, the people gre@@ w and multi@@ pli@@ ed in egypt ,
