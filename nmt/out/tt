you know , one of the big <unk> during travel and one of the joy of the <unk> research is , in common with people who can remember the old days . that their past are still feeling on the old stones .
just knowing that <unk> still travel beyond the milky way or the meaning of the elders of the inuit , which is the idea that the world is the world , which is the world that the world is , in which the world is , in which the world is the world , in which , that the world is , in which the world is the world that the world , in which is the way that the world is , as a consequence of a group of certain ways that our ancestors , even successful , many generations ago .
and of course we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to get to the <unk> separation by the death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and that doesn &apos;t matter that it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , this is a <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara . or even a <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there &apos;s another <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of changing on earth .
and this is an idea that when you think about it , one can be able to meet hope with hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that are going to be more important and for that &apos;s the way the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> can imagine as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths and intuitions that were driven by the human imagination since the early minds of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
she &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are able to do as amazing species .
and as the same as the biosphere was strong eroding , this was starting with the <unk> -- only with even greater speed .
no a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are short before extinction , because it just doesn &apos;t be true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- corresponds to what &apos;s known as <unk> <unk> on the field of cultural diversity .
and the crucial indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when each of them was born in this room , were spoken on the world 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the totality of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
she &apos;s a means of the soul with the soul of a certain culture of the material world .
any language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , a idea , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages , today , today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half of the ears <unk> .
they didn &apos;t teach infants anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely as a silence to be <unk> , one of the last of your people who talk to your language is not a possibility of your language , or to expect the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors ?
and yet , this horrible fate actually is actually somewhere on the earth , about all two weeks , because of all two weeks , dies an elderly man and takes the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of you , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we &apos;re all talking about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be that language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let them be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take you in a sense of a journey through the <unk> , a quick trip through the <unk> , to try to make them understand what &apos;s actually gone .
now there are some of us out of us that i say , when i say &quot; different ways of his life , &quot; really different ways of his own .
take the example of this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east by sacred snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t be cognitively growing between the colors between the colors and green , because the <unk> is the forest , which people depend upon .
they have a strange language and a <unk> that will be called linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who talks a different language .
all of this roots in the <unk> past . the strange to these big houses , in which because of the <unk> six or seven languages be talked that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just hear up and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating strains that i &apos;ve ever lived in , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was contacted peaceful .
in 1957 , five <unk> contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they took shiny photographs of himself from the air , which we would pay as a friendly gesture . they forgot that these people out of the rainforest has never seen something more <unk> .
they lifted these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find nothing and <unk> that this business business of cancer are killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t have killing the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death and when we had the people to <unk> something that was so old , they gave him that one of the people died that he died , and we killed him .
but at the same time , she had a clear idea of forests that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine from 40 steps , smell and determine what animal species of this owned .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job when i was talking about haiti and the secret societies , which was the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> , which were the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> and the poison that was used for that to make <unk> .
to give this <unk> one sense , i had to give course something about this remarkable faith and <unk> is no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s about a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them to read the big world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism or whatever .
a continent continues to leave out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith . of course , there was a religious belief . of course , it &apos;s just the remnant of these very profound religious thoughts that was during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what <unk> is so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living lead to the spirits .
the ghosts can be <unk> from below the big water , answers to the rhythm of the living being temporarily temporarily being temporary to <unk> , so that the <unk> for a brief <unk> moment to god .
<unk> say , &quot; your white goes into the church and say about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind . how can you do damage to you ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without burning , an amazing visualization of the spirit of the mind the body is so to affect the body that it &apos;s going to affect the way that it is <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people who i met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada <unk> de <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , which is the heart <unk> of colombia , and in a result of the conquest of the conquest , moved to this people in a <unk> <unk> , which is rising over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were never conquered by the <unk> .
until the day today , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood . the training for priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world , in the base of the glacier for 18 years . two periods of times nine years of pregnancy , they spend now <unk> in the lap of pregnancy , spend now <unk> in the lap of great mother .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re introduced culturally into the values of their society . values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic court -- or we could tell the environmental -- equilibrium .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , they will suddenly take out one day , and for the first time in your life , you see everything you have learned at the abstract beautiful landscape , when the sun begins to see , and in this <unk> moment , when the sun begins to look at in abstract , and says , &quot; do you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of war and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old rumor of the fancy wild , which is a <unk> thought , or saying , these people are more associated with nature than we do .
so , aboriginal are neither <unk> , nor will be from the <unk> weakened .
it doesn &apos;t stop much space in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , they &apos;re shaped by the idea of the earth that &apos;s not shaped to be aware of the idea , but on a very close intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because they &apos;re <unk> into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes that will be in the andes that will be a <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and a different relationship of montana , and a different relationship in montana , that a mountain is a bunch of stones , which is a pile of stones that can be eroding .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature is defined by nature and nature .
i grew up in the woods of <unk> colombia on and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
that made me to another person as my friends as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits , who are at the <unk> of the world , minds that they were involved in their <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from the many of you have heard of the most powerful preparation of the repertoire .
what <unk> is so fascinating is not just the most fascinating thing , is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but on the one hand , there &apos;s been this wooden <unk> , which puts a series of <unk> , and on the one side , there &apos;s something like a series of <unk> , but on the petals with the petals of a <unk> of the family with the name of the <unk> with the name of the <unk> with the name of the <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that they create from different species also contains <unk> .
this powder is to <unk> is kind of like a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it becomes no distortion of reality , but resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the <unk> mushrooms , and i argued that you could feel this <unk> as <unk> , because in the moment you can feel the impact of the impact , you can &apos;t feel more there to experience a <unk> .
but the thing with <unk> is that they can &apos;t take <unk> , because they can &apos;t <unk> by one in the human gut with names , with names , <unk> .
they can only be taken into connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating is that the <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> from exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people made out of a flora of 80,000 species of reducing these two <unk> plants , which , if in this way , they &apos;re combining , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole larger version of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistakes , which turns out as meaningless .
but you wonder the indians say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which they &apos;re all in very distance in the forest that can see for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they found your <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take any of the 17 variants at <unk> and they sing to one in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than <unk> .
now , the <unk> is the problem is that even those among us , the sympathy of us have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the sympathy of native americans , they look at the past , whereas the real world , that means our world , progresses .
so , fact , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to look at the 20th century , in 300 years , in 300 years , but rather than an era of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active and passive diversity on earth either active and passive diversity . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have always involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> listened to sioux , when they were bow and arrow of tasks , as the americans stopped americans , when they stopped americans and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you &apos;ve always <unk> in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not going to be <unk> by the fall of raw forces , which is going to be rejected with raw forces , which is going to be rejected with raw forces , which was willing to see their <unk> with raw <unk> , who was willing to see their <unk> with raw <unk> . or as in the case of the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> in the forest . or as in the case of the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , which were <unk> during the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i have <unk> a lot , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people will be convicted of , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives is not just not just convicted , but <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you don &apos;t have experienced it at <unk> level .
i was once with a young colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you &apos;ve heard on the statistics and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug bug , with their holiness the people in nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for the crime .
he was placed in the age of two years into prison to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that this brave did <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day , they came out of an tags on a <unk> and for this <unk> , she had to work for seven years camp .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really have a choice before . would we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she said that it was their greatest fear , we would change the whole range of human imagination , we wouldn &apos;t just see the entire range of human imagination , but that we would see the entire range of human imagination , but that we would have to see that there was ever other other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us the agriculture , and we put us in this moment of cult <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood &apos;s <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of the priesthood &apos;s <unk> and hierarchy , specialization was just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all respond to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
when we ask these myriad <unk> after the importance of human beings , answers with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;ll be able to <unk> the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness is that all people are aware that all people and gardens is to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went with <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit and during the <unk> years of the <unk> of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather man refused .
the family , the fear of his life had taken him all the weapons and all tools .
now you have to know that the inuit weren &apos;t afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of her sledge were originally from fish who was made in <unk> in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid before the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out to outside , his pants made out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces started , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the pages of the <unk> and as it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and playing a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and hacking a sled , <unk> a different dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
so you can do nothing like anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all the native parts on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit , in april 1999 , the complete control over an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that <unk> <unk> with their people and achieve .
and finally , i believe , it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who are to the distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times . and for all of us , are going to become the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children part of the geography of the hope .
what we ended up at national geographic is trying to believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling . our website receives 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we corporation a series of trips into the <unk> where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonders , that this world has made it in a really multicultural world , that this world has made it in a truly multicultural world , that this world has made it in a really multicultural world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do you first , as fast as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year , which is <unk> . and it &apos;s an environment where they either get local or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you can seamlessly create and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big those collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can be the performance of a system like this is the number of a system like this , is the numbers on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper to read , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also made something at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really rampant this ideas to stop this limits for the screen on the screen .
we hope that this is no <unk> and other nonsense more -- that should not need to be necessary .
of course , this is mapping one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re also contributing to this domain .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take something else out .
this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project with the name that really connects two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which of noah <unk> , a <unk> of the university of washington , under the counseling of steve <unk> at the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that , if we can create this kind of views where we can penetrate pictures and have this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation structure is here in fact in fact .
the <unk> have held these images together with the real space , in which these recordings that were made out near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , correspond to the elements of <unk> , or <unk> and these things were put in relation to each other in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got to show you other environments .
there &apos;s what that &apos;s much more <unk> .
i &apos;d like to go straight straight to the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from an early prototype of <unk> that we first worked on the punchline of this technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you look at the environments that we look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a <unk> executive of the cathedral notre dame , which did only in the computer with images on the computer . give me pictures of men on flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in flickr and on the <unk> and forth , each of this orange <unk> represents a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know . you know , i never believed that i will actually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception desk here .
i guess you can see , you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them that were all <unk> in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange strange .
many of them are from their faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame that was right right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of it , how to look at visual -- and everything becomes connected to each other .
all these photographs will get together and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the labor of the labor of stephen <unk> at virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , grows and its use for the user with the application .
their own photos are <unk> with metadata that has a different person took a different person .
if somebody had the effort and all of these saints labeled , and tells you who they &apos;re all , then my photo of the notre <unk> would <unk> with all this data , and i can use them as a start to go into this room , and i can use them as a point of <unk> <unk> of other people and make a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> of other people .
and of course , <unk> all of that are the extremely rich virtual models of the earth that doesn &apos;t only get through <unk> or satellite imagery and so forth , but by collective memory .
thank you .
. do i understand you right ? your software is that at a certain point , in the next time , all the images that are used by someone in the world are common to each other ?
yes . she does nothing else to discover .
if you want them to create <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the amount of <unk> information that are many of these pictures .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures , where they put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information , which is the picture that is .
but how would it be when the picture you connected with all their pictures ?
then the scope of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that comes out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things out of my book , as i hope , in unison with other things you &apos;ve already heard . and i &apos;m going to try to create a few connections , if you didn &apos;t notice this .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
that official <unk> works so : if our goal is maximizing the common good our citizens , this is largely by the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , a <unk> premise for human .
if people have freedom , each of us , each of us is to do the things that make our good and nobody has to decide for us .
the way of freedom is maximizing choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have . and the more freedom you have , the more freedom you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply , that it wouldn &apos;t come to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enables us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say just something about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if they don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that could buy a large number of own lettuce in their lettuce , in the unlikely case that none of the car for you right .
so this is , like the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in that one of the electronics , there is so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together <unk> million different assets from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy , you could have every phone waiting for as long until he came from ma bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and you should not have that until now in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people to walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more likely than to buy objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you : we could do b or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you &apos;d be , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not she . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of someone who knows something of someone who knows something of someone who knows , and therefore , not in the best constitution , and therefore , not in the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like them and me , that , if you think about it , at all , if you don &apos;t buy them , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why don &apos;t you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to call us the doctor at the next morning and to ask a change of the prescription .
something so <unk> as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we <unk> no identity , we invent them .
and we are also reinventing ourselves so often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , they need to decide what a kind of person wants to be you .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , in which <unk> was that almost everybody had one had one , and that they could get as fast as they could , and then kids were able to get as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who &quot; don &apos;t , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i used to do earlier .
and that not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i just have kids , or just a career ? &quot;
those are all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means to make all the tasks that i do and don &apos;t get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to be blessed with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every time on the planet -- until on the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i don &apos;t get to tell you that <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make in terms of work , again and again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can see our kids in playing football play , and we have our mobile phone on the rest of the hip and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our laps .
and even if they &apos;re off all , every minute in which we <unk> our child <unk> , we also ask us , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also when the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;ll be about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , <unk> ways is that it &apos;s <unk> instead .
with so many options you can choose , it falls very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of that , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> from <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> who took the employers who took the participation .
you offer 50 <unk> to -- 10 percent less employees , as if you only offer 5 . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> , which are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to pick it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow is never coming .
you know , you know that that &apos;s not just that people need to eat food when they go into retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to travel , it means that they have a lot of decisions that they miss great <unk> their employers .
by not participating , they give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world that looks like this .
they want to make the decision really really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment back , or even the wrong <unk> .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice as if we had the opportunity to choose between less ways .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is one of them , requires the big choice of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what happens is that you have a more decision , and what happens is that you have a more decision , and what happens is that you have a more decision , and what happens is that you have a better decision , and this regret works on the happiness that they had been made by their mind , even if it was a good decision .
the more opportunities there is , the easier , it &apos;s nothing to regret at all this is <unk> for the choice .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by he told how much the way that we would rate in the way we think about what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to think of this , it &apos;s just attractive qualities of thinking of alternatives that makes you less content with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they would have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for itself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility , day , a great parking lot about day .
<unk> reduce the happiness that we get through our choices , also when that what we &apos;ve selected is fantastic .
and the more ways it gives you more attractive qualities , the more attractive qualities of these choices are going to account into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it in now and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he does is : always who they decide for a thing , they don &apos;t decide other things .
and these other things may have many attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this was struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans in which , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they &apos;ve bought them , they were incredibly <unk> and when she carried them long enough , they were starting to have , &quot; okay . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want <unk> , lightly <unk> or big ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on he told him .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour with all this bloody jeans , and i &apos;ll tell the business -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all this selection allowed me to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason for the reason that i was worse , with all this available possibilities , my expectations for doing what a good couple of jeans is high .
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations when it just gave them in a way .
when they came in 100 species , damn one of you should have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i had expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected .
the adding of opportunities in the lives of people &apos;s lives will inevitably increase people as good as good as well .
and this leads to the same satisfaction with the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows this . because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it &apos;s going on here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than everything was worse than anything worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for people who were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can hope is things as well as you expect it .
they will never be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;re all coming -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i could not make it better . i don &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always as a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the <unk> one is a bad standing jeans if it &apos;s just a way to buy , and you ask why , who is responsible . the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : they .
they would have better do better .
with 100 different types of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and also when the results of decisions are good , feel more disappointed , they blame themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also , that people have been so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences . and then if you have to explain these experiences , think of it .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s generally better to be objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think of is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is something more more than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that that &apos;s more choice better than a little selection .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve lost this point long at the time that we &apos;ve improved our greater greater good .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule question , the thing about thinking about this . that &apos;s what all of these selection enables in the industrialized societies , is the material of wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is that is so frustrating : steve <unk> has told you about how this more expensive and hard to <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry that we &apos;re worse there .
if something of what the people of our society enables us to make decisions to the societies in which people would have changed , not only the life of people would be improved , but our dignity will also improve .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great selection selection .
finally , read this cartoon , please read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s not possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if they break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , lower the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to narrow with perfect security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> being being <unk> is a recipe for misery and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects already before , about the human genome and what that means , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized the biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new lives .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists are trying to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the shift from the direct world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we try to ask if we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab . and we &apos;ve tried to achieve that with a smaller genome .
we managed to prevent it on to about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic card , which is very simple , in comparison to us . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we can eliminate all these genes that we can eliminate one after the others , it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to make that the only way to synthesize the individual components and so some of those fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecules ever before ?
and if we can do that , we can launch the chromosome ?
a chromosome is so by just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the digitize of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has increased very slowly yet . and our last point would have now put on a exponential curve .
we started about 15 years ago .
it actually took some years starting with a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and <unk> the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria kills .
we built little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and came back and killing e. coli .
recently , i talked about the oil industry and they said that they could understand this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually , in a biological system , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters in the size of the virus , so we thought we could vary it in tapes .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in computer , these digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome first in 1995 was the <unk> at a mistake .
we found at <unk> 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been <unk> .
a part of the design is to create pieces of 50 letters long and who have to overlay with other <unk> pieces , to build smaller <unk> .
we have built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in <unk> .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we just signed up .
some people were saying it was no poetry .
we have the pieces so that we could just divide them with enzymes with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair these fixing and forth .
and we &apos;ve started to create pieces , starting with the pieces of five to <unk> letters in these together , added these together in order to put these back to <unk> .
in each step , we have these pieces in surplus as we could sequence them because we tried a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right work -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then these are not just going to grow in e. coli . it goes beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew by a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to repair dna to fix these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field , that chromosome is simple apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything went together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space exist and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made that by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve just used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we put them off . yeast puts them together automatically .
this is not <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we actually can see it with the <unk> .
that &apos;s footage over a long amount of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over <unk> letters on <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would contain <unk> pages , just around this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , that it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simple when you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this cloning .
at <unk> is the chromosome into the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to others and activate these .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly said , are these two more removed as humans and mice . and it was very amazing than we had to destroy it in a cell -- and it was very amazing than we gave it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very <unk> .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we tried to take the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all species of species here , or a third of <unk> , every time of thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species .
so people that imagine evolution as a gene that has changed at a moment that has changed much of biology .
there is enzymes the <unk> is called the <unk> that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we put down .
it was <unk> in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes we &apos;ve added in .
and after a very short time , it had all characteristics of the species of the species and <unk> completely into a new species on the new software that we gave in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve pulled back .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things change things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution
and i have argued that we could possibly create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be created a new form of the cambrian explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re doing this six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people have existed on this planet for each of the year in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for eight billion people .
it will give a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion drums of oil . that &apos;s hundreds of millions of drums on the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material landing in the atmosphere .
we now have now , from our discoveries , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of this .
we poke here in the limits of biological reality and that of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this fast <unk> to do that what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot of the millions of chromosomes on the day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or making these processes to create <unk> or medication new vaccines , we can change with a little team of molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of actually <unk> at the one we &apos;re working with that you actually sit down and make new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fossil generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn , recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation that are going to be coming out of much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different species of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only kind of biology is a huge impact without more increase in food or the limitation of their availability , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with <unk> of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , with almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane to use hydrogen as energy source .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be <unk> to <unk> , <unk> the co2 in fuel to power that process .
within a short period , we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the whole <unk> industry . right . if you don &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a <unk> of the energy .
but likewise , we &apos;re working on doing the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back and have a dollar too little when it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , as the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we are light years away from people . our goal is it only is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s far as far . and for all those who were not there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment which ever became -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a <unk> second of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just amazing ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter of the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in construction so they see the scale .
at the last september last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> which the entire route to the lhc <unk> to <unk> to a part of the lhc to <unk> an rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine is going to work , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> , or this , when someone went to google side and the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here here .
these wires lead <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no that doesn &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because when you get them very far down , they become called <unk> .
so at negative degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand that tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets , there was a <unk> .
by making heat heat slightly and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , that &apos;s all wonderful than you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and shifted about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re now all over your way back .
at the end of march will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect first data in june or july , and put our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a way , these accidents are taking the conversation again to the value of science and <unk> on such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it is so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our borders , forms the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to one of a english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who defended the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his training was so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , as to assume that our scientific notions of the human mind is that our <unk> are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
however , recent is recent life in my life and my career , which has happened to me , which has been me to rethink my work completely .
this strange event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , decided differently in the world , and a big <unk> , international <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t mean , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;d be the demise of extinction .
seriously -- the reduction <unk> !
for example , they come up with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that they never will be <unk> ?
do you have no fear before that they <unk> their entire life and never create a book that you care in the world ? never again ?
okay , that makes really courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i would remember about 20 years ago when i first told you about 20 years ago , that i wanted to be writer , with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> have no fear , never succeed ?
don &apos;t you feel frightened that the humiliation of an <unk> kills ?
don &apos;t you feel fear that you &apos;ve never got this craft your life , and you never get something that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ash of the failure ?
so about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all this questions is : <unk> yes .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and that &apos;s always me .
and i &apos;ve still scared a lot more things that no one would show up .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i think , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that of someone should be expected to do that he was afraid to do the work ?
and what exactly is with the creative company is that they &apos;re doing insecure about the reciprocal quality -- in a way , how other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , he was asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair to be fair -- the group of chemists have not receiving the reputation of <unk> people .
we were writers , but not only the writers , but not only the writers of all the <unk> , seem to be able to be mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at bitter <unk> of really great minds alone , the young and often of their own hand died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , were really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books had killed me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even twitch when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of tells you as a long time . somehow , we &apos;ve seen the notion that creativity and <unk> , of course , <unk> and that art -- always <unk> -- always to <unk> .
the question that i want to ask today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel about that ? because with only one centimeter distance , i feel at all of this notion at all .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s taken over to the next century .
i find it better when we encourage our big creative encourage life .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start with this dark path of the conjecture -- especially in the fact , in the fact i &apos;m in my career .
that means -- look : i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work is being judged after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s most likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that can get someone to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and that doesn &apos;t want to drink that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to me that i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological construction building .
somehow i have to find from now to a way , writing a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i looked for models to models for models to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to see other societies to see whether they might have better or <unk> ideas about how to help , with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity .
this was looking at me in old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in old greece and rome have not believed the people that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
from socrates known that he believed that he would have a <unk> that <unk> him out of the distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> genius <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly smart individual individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical thing , from that believed that it was literally living in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist in the work of the work was kind of invisible and the result of the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work is brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not perfect , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people in the west really have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came up and all changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the universe -- over all of the gods , and there &apos;s no room more for mystic creatures to take orders from divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started to believe that creativity was completely from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people this or those artists call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to say , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a naked person that he thinks he or the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence of all , human psychology <unk> .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the cancer and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations to success .
i think that this <unk> has destroyed our artists of the last 500 years .
and when that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t get the <unk> from 500 years of rational humanism not just zap a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would register <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> that people <unk> and <unk> on their projects etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes it as much sense like everything else i &apos;ve heard , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that goes -- like everybody knows it has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , he can feel really <unk> .
i had another encounter when i met the encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which was now over the fields , but she told me that she was working on the fields . she told me that she was working on the fields . she told me that she would feel and listen like a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a <unk> train out of air .
that &apos;s about the country on them .
she felt , when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could do in a moment such a moment . and that was -- in their words -- <unk> run like the devil <unk> .
she ran as the devil to the house while she was haunted by this poem . it was only about that she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen had to get it through a piece of paper and a pen could capture and capture on the sheet .
at other painting , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran up and ran it . she didn &apos;t missed it and ran it . she didn &apos;t missed it on land and -- as she said , <unk> after another poet looking for another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said there were more moments in which she was almost missed .
so , she &apos;s running up to the house and looking for the paper and the poem drive through them , and she grabs a pen just as it was going through their other hand and then -- said it was like to grab with her other hand and put it .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem was fine and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought <unk> this is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work i have to work every day at the same time and sweating , and really awkward <unk> .
but even i have in my <unk> , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had to work or ideas , which is from a source through me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we start to lose that in relation to our minds , but we even lose ourselves in the contrary to intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musicians tom <unk> . i had to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what &apos;s the most time of his life , who was trying to beat these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him to dominate and deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he had one day on a freeway , and since there &apos;s all changed for him .
he went at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which , as it &apos;s a lot of a melody , and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . and he wants them . she &apos;s <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he has no <unk> .
so he begins , these old <unk> into him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t create it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just listened to .
he stopped the whole thought and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , <unk> excuse me , can you not see that i drive car ?
<unk> , i look like this as could i just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on to a <unk> moment , when i can care about you .
if not , <unk> is somebody else today .
go and <unk> leonard .
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still as dark as ever used .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , was salvaged than he was taking the genius out of itself , where he was doing nothing as trouble and him , where he came from . he had been able to have a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising collaboration , weird collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , internal thing that was not quite a tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and it even saved me .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love . i fell in one of these regions of the <unk> , when we &apos;re all going to work , and it doesn &apos;t work .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript and talked my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i talked loudly : <unk> listen , you and i know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not quite my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to put up here and push your budget .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to go further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask to the record that i was today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows as follows in the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and music , who were gathered for hours to stopped -- until at dawn .
these fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , and again , very rare , happened something special . one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that they &apos;ve all seen in your life before .
it was as a time <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> . he did nothing different than he did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything made together .
and suddenly he appeared he didn &apos;t seem more human .
he was getting up from the inside of the inside and from below below the bottom , through a <unk> fire .
when so something happened at the time , people knew what was that . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came to the <unk> , they brought these practice . the pronunciation changed in the course of the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still have at <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer in spain has done something magical : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there is : a <unk> view on god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky thing follows the next morning when the dancers themselves wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he no longer was a <unk> of god in themselves .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never get back to that altitude .
and maybe someone will never call god names when he turns . but what should he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they haven &apos;t believed in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a loaner -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of their life that &apos;s passed on to somebody else when they &apos;re ready with it .
if we start thinking about this , that &apos;s all changes .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book that will appear soon -- as dangerous , very expected , very expected to success .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;ll be crazy about this , is no fear .
not <unk> .
make your job .
be still for your contribution there , whatever he will be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine divine divine divine is calling you to the side , decides for a brief moment of miracle through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance still your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that and i feel that , we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , that you just love the mere human love and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , who had shrunk for nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states to be shrunk by 40 percent .
but this is not strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it shows not the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , this is the annual ice in winter ; and it shrinks <unk> in the summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood that comes out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be coming from here .
this is a problem , there &apos;s the warming of the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , in which there is large amounts of carbon dioxide , which if he <unk> <unk> , from microbes , which is being done by methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could double if we cross this critical point .
today , <unk> <unk> in some flat lakes in alaska .
professor <unk> , walter <unk> in alaska is with another prosthetic seas in alaska .
wow !
she &apos;s good . the question is , how will it <unk> us .
and one reason is , that huge heat warms up from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up by <unk> , they <unk> into the sea .
these rivers are taking very fast .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , the entire continent volunteered that the entire continent has now <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> , is particularly strong at the melting .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top new lakes that were crossing a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have expanded .
but if you <unk> , also most drinking water &apos;s <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of oil was seen of sierra intelligence .
this affects the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this <unk> in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have increased in a really <unk> and previously , an unprecedented extent .
so many times in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 by carbon -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific exactly , from the american continent and <unk> of the indian <unk> of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest individual factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the exact biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminate the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is there a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
around christmas , at christmas , at home in tennessee , one billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this happened about christmas .
one of the commercials of <unk> around christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy kid .
there &apos;s it in shell and abundance in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> becomes every day clean .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell a very clear one . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they talk about .
so the alliance has called two campaigns for protection .
this is one , a part of her .
at the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it up to the top <unk> , a sizable <unk> on the way to bring the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and smells of good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that that quiet us .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkable <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work to make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america &apos;s new . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways of the fastest ways of the old , dirty fuels , which <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good jobs .
<unk> america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask you at the time of your childhood , when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to overcome the hands out of it and <unk> , the <unk> , and moves , they actually learned to understand and changing problems through the understanding and changing information .
the spatial space is very closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , which would be when we could use computers , which would be when we could take computers and take data , and they could take the data and distribute data , how we want to do it ?
this question was so profound that we decided to study the answer and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with the hand , they can perceive each other , they can see their movements and they have a screen and a <unk> .
much more importantly , are physically , why you only move them through the reach of your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of <unk> data .
and if these tools are a tool , and an awareness for their movements , they can recognize each other and see the intricacies of our <unk> with you , then we can start with exploration and more entertaining <unk> .
i start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and when i put it into a direction , the video &apos;s going to play forward ; if i go into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , you make it interest .
if they &apos;re <unk> around , you notice that and can be nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling also their movements and bend .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like , how to push this with fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they will be blended together .
if we overdo it , we can make a little bit of <unk> .
there &apos;s also some nice ways in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and we want to see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m using with a simple <unk> model .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of round letters , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , these things are tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , and you have a new <unk> and try to try a new <unk> .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a media lab . i could move them to try it and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact at this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; forms &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest <unk> at the bottom right .
it turns out that he just wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by making the <unk> from the table , which shows this character .
here he leaves the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he picks a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by making the <unk> shaking and they put the characters side-by-side ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story open and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example , for that i have time today to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , as <unk> , <unk> and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes in the sequence that you can organize in any patterns .
and you <unk> them by just by just holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect him with a certain clay and tends to be hiring .
and then even larger effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start , in which we <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and put these into a row , they expand and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something even drums on .
and now i &apos;ll hook the filters with the drums so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by getting the pace in one or other direction .
and now i hook the filters with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as she &apos;s going on .
so , i don &apos;t have to make them in advance , but i can improvise ; they &apos;re expanding in reducing the time .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by looking out to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is , my desire to develop new <unk> , the better way to fit our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the thought that i want to give you on the way is that we want to give you the door to this new generation of <unk> to the world with digital media , the information to bring information into our world that makes our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at the conversations with you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yes , so , what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back to a little back , and it &apos;s <unk> at the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular and research now now for a few years with the <unk> , and that &apos;s what i started to know because i just wanted to know , and it wanted to make everything i &apos;ve learned in college studying .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think the biology of biology now , so quite generally talking biotechnology , which you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is very important , now extremely important , is going to be much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like these whole genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
under then , there &apos;s also things that are going to come completely in everyday life , which is what most people are not aware of , for example , that allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue endlessly .
and so from the interest in this technology , in this technology , i &apos;m just moving on .
so what &apos;s hacking now ?
most people know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers <unk> , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hacker break up somewhere and claws and so on .
this is kind of a lot for the <unk> very sad , because that doesn &apos;t hit what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually started behind it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> , and this is also the internet came out .
and it &apos;s about that with a playful , creative , original original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> what makes things like things like things like things like things like things like things , and how can you make that better .
and it was just going to be kind of software , but there &apos;s also it in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that makes all kinds of <unk> things .
and now still hold in towards biology , and there i want to take this metaphor , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s real matter because it &apos;s real matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and look at it also , and so i find it incredibly fascinating , and there i just wanted to find a lot deeper with her .
this actually has just been <unk> eight , these these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , which is now members or active people everywhere around the world .
that &apos;s this has a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and companies and in collaboration with scientists and asking questions and ask questions and ask questions and ask questions and say , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about how to find a <unk> access , so a playful deal with that .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> , <unk> .
this is out of the <unk> a network , which is actually more like a forum where you look true and discussed online .
these are a little technical aligned and also a little bit of <unk> on the way , then also , so , yes , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , has changed so a scene that i &apos;d like to <unk> .
here in the image on the upper left , you see <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> , so in principle , a kind of school , non-profit , a foreign school , where everybody can be .
kids , old , all kinds of people go to all kinds of people , and they &apos;ve made a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> .
here &apos;s a group at the bottom there is a group in indonesia , <unk> means that there &apos;s it pretty long .
more longer than those other countries .
they also tend to deal in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and combine this in quite a kind of <unk> way .
a group from ankara , which i met a while ago , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is what they &apos;d like to teach the public , which is what they &apos;re learning in college , and they were trying to explain to people who &apos;s <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got up on the other picture , a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of a exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing what what &apos;s actually united of the things , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with that and also , in fact , in terms of the society that <unk> and ask , okay , so , okay , what do you want to join , do your interest in this , do you have to bring up with that ?
so , <unk> , to hacking biology now , you need kind of material .
you need of course need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
or , what you normally understand under a lab , these are so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , just for <unk> , trained academic , trained and so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that actually doesn &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every single <unk> has actually developed higher technology than most <unk> , that &apos;s really like this .
and all of these premise with that premise then , for example , brian <unk> in england is trying to have a <unk> <unk> , and then , yes , so <unk> , and has been grown up with bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s already a soup is <unk> that he has left too long , too .
i &apos;m trying to try this in my lab home , trying to take a little bit , and then put me down as <unk> on ebay and a little <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so as so / <unk> .
that should actually be no joke now , but .
here in the picture , you see the laboratory , you see the lab , so , in <unk> , which has been in college , which has been in college , a group in paris , which has a lot of <unk> in paris , which has been doing , and also really interesting things , and also , i want to make a project just a project just <unk> .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s there , there &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s there to big organizations that are going to make that home to big organizations , which is more <unk> in <unk> form .
but always always the approach that it &apos;s going to be easy and to be accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve made as international group , when we were kind of aware of our selves , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re up online , and we &apos;re all familiar with people who always chat there and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founders of the founders , and he said , even real meeting , and has a real meeting , and then have two events , and then , in the <unk> , <unk> 10 , and shortly on the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , there &apos;s also , there was also <unk> , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our purpose , our positions ?
and there we then have a <unk> shot .
that was pretty intuitive , so everybody has just got so his wishes , his and what it is moving .
there came up , i think , a very good code done .
and then we &apos;ve got that that is not compulsory , but that &apos;s actually , i think , has pretty well taken quite well , people are quite convinced from this .
and we actually tried to do that in the world &apos;s academic world , but there &apos;s not kind of gone along .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in the way , even one step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects do we actually do so ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we wanted to make a so-called optical engineer or optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air or then in the ground , and then move into this focus , so , that &apos;s actually captured there , so like such as a <unk> in principle .
this really works , that &apos;s going to work in the academic <unk> , and we think <unk> , we took a webcam , the lens <unk> , the lens <unk> , the lens <unk> , then you have a microscope , that increases a microscope .
that &apos;s where you see this .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> the laser <unk> and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we still learned a lot of this .
so another project that &apos;s from the french group , which has worked out of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he has so a look like this , such as a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he has been engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this this helmet in there , and in cooperation with the museum , that walked .
then the visitors in the room could go in the room , put on this chair in the helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or as you thought , is then different lights in the room .
was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is that the <unk> , this is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying , to copy genes , to reproduce , <unk> , fragments that you can make them visible .
so , if i do that the <unk> at the scene of the crime , then then go out there , collect any <unk> , and then they can say , <unk> , this hair , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair , this room , like this .
and the machines that make something like this , which are pretty expensive as that you buy commercially , the cheapest will go at <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
and they have there , there have so two two builders <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s going to be easier and cheaper hardware , <unk> , and then made that out of open source , and then they &apos;ve got the cheapest source of that , and now are that the cheapest vendor of these devices worldwide .
i think , sort of as six dollars or something .
but on any case , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s on any case in a frame where it &apos;s clearly being available .
so it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i had started to build was a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two centimeters or so .
you invites <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> then in these <unk> , and then i &apos;ve taken that on <unk> and then put it up to light .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but this is so my prototype , which but pretty wild looked like this , so on so a branch of electronics on this , that thing was on electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , the thing is broken .
and then i took a <unk> and that was plugged in .
a <unk> , if you get the full power with water , which is enough pressure , so i think so 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and so you can get the particles strong enough and then go into the onion in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros up or something , <unk> so about 50 .
so that it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially feasible .
so this is also also that that is the <unk> of the scene at the moment , this availability of technology , and also increase the information and the <unk> that more people can get together there .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also no chance to form there .
because , if you just read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it even again or seen .
and i think technology is increasingly more important in our modern societies .
and if you &apos;re also able to make meaningful citizens in society , you can make meaningful decisions in society and join the access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it also and understand it to make it and understand it .
and the <unk> then under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so that just you &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get through these scientific technologies .
and this is that the <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that they are also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that &apos;s there , there are less people registered as in fact .
so i know of some that didn &apos;t put themselves out .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
partly with this <unk> , so these places together .
and that &apos;s quite in the beginning .
as said , <unk> has just started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , there was the <unk> in berlin , the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> has become represented everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to move into the same way , and then they &apos;re also similar to very well connected , so that hold more <unk> people involved .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even again .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
thanks very much for listening .
that was it .
yes , hello .
how do we work people actually ?
that &apos;s a question that &apos;s very moving me as a designer , but also in the area in the <unk> <unk> and before all of the things in the area of the world .
there &apos;s about how to look at people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media and so they create a more <unk> experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in us <unk> cognitive models , so paradigm that &apos;s <unk> in our biological memory , so that we &apos;ve been programmed in our biological memory .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this <unk> that you &apos;ve seen in the future , but actually it &apos;s so that the future is exactly at us , at our <unk> roots .
what are actually <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve written four <unk> home and i &apos;d like to explain that briefly .
to <unk> cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
to this <unk> models heard that we have a genetically natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go to the same time , and i &apos;m going to show you by trial that also you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve also been able to talk to these <unk> models , very , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains actually by itself .
we all know that the interactive media are <unk> by definition , which involves the denial of linearity , and what of course tells us that we feel the linearity today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
now , how about the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing of the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that .
how many doors has the house where you live ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and happens in the moment .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> the reality and it &apos;s completely without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we &apos;re trouble giving us to <unk> the virtual reality in our <unk> , we can actually show that all the time .
and this piece of this assets are going to <unk> the reality of reality , who have had people in the pre-industrial time , because they had nothing at all .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memories played off .
in this head , knowledge <unk> , and using this virtual images , the imagination , was passed on .
and therefore it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time of the person is <unk> and medium itself .
now , if you keep thinking a bit further .
what are today media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
but that &apos;s what i get to talk about .
significant tool of <unk> have been in <unk> since traditionally .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , were extra stopped to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still focused very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to <unk> , we still have <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child which is to reach it until to achieve the most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we were as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
this goes much further back to the cultures of the pre-industrial time .
but for me , but for me , in the field of interactive media as particularly impressive is that we have based on our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i brought you an example of the north north of the north of the <unk> tribe .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , from island , from island , to raise food .
and they &apos;ve made this with so-called <unk> .
that may be familiar with you , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they &apos;ve used the <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by songs .
where the language has been deciphered by the language of <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology that shows the topography of a region and that , of course , has enabled , of course , that you could <unk> these songs and look like that on the left , to the left , and again , back to <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing but not anymore to come from top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
it &apos;s happening is that this is that <unk> age machine .
we &apos;ve been moving before that &apos;s called <unk> .
happened is the age machine and happened is the book and happened is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve shifted the responsibility for our memories and that the own production of our individual memories have shifted external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve got god to <unk> a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> at the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , and so on what we call the book and so on what we think as mass media , and so on what we call mass mass media today , that these mass mass of our memories have <unk> and our ability to <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the age age .
what has damage to our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> influences the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be in the course of the centuries of the centuries and more <unk> by the influence of <unk> .
that means , instead of remembering ourselves , we &apos;ve been standardized , very common , distributed patterns of memories that we can depend our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing more in images that things don &apos;t have things in images , but we <unk> them to our language .
we &apos;ve got used to that things are linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still we are the <unk> as <unk> as <unk> very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s coming now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called <unk> .
that sounds very <unk> on and sounds very after fiction fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which will bring us those of these options back to discover our skills again .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain that briefly .
there are technical concepts like <unk> reality , which means the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then this is so a concept of what the virtual world allows us to combine to the virtual world , which means our <unk> to the virtual world , the virtual world will be addressed again .
another example is the so-called reality .
so , of course , that , of course , sound may sound , because we &apos;re moving to physically <unk> , virtual worlds , completely after the <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a people .
all that needs the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i have in the degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can just get up at a moment , so they can go in the break with the two about the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again to this <unk> , cognitive models will be addressed .
this whole is a game , i have to say to that .
what the <unk> of course extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , then you have very likely in front of eyes that any people of some <unk> <unk> or that they &apos;re playing with the with any <unk> in the hand .
on any case , that they do that in there .
this is a game for outside .
and this is specifically thinking that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects to the virtual world , so the data is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to me that i have to expand so strong .
you can get that much better better , there &apos;s more much more behind that .
and this is about that i discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative <unk> .
and this is how i get from the city a whole different sight , which is a whole different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting so on this way , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this is the virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clearly clear .
and with a way , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , i &apos;d like to summarize that my my talk and that was in the sense that the characteristics of the <unk> <unk> have acquired and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and the skills that we have acquired with the way of the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve actually had to be activated in the future , but actually to us back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be very much to you .
i &apos;ve just been asked by just if this bag is a <unk> bag , and my instead of talking .
that &apos;s not going to make it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve just what there is in there .
but so far i do it just just curious .
yes , kids are from nature from curious or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m looking at the subject of the curiosity , and how changes the curiosity , and why we might lose curiosity and why we might lose curiosity and so again and so forth and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you have to be concerned with the actual experience as a creator .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> in so n <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half a year .
a <unk> to the theme of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why catch all the creator of itself with so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interactions and so on .
and there i just hold one of these little devices high , because the things should be intuitive , and there are more natural , <unk> , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and before the background , i &apos;ve interface myself in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation of the human computer in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship with how our tools or how the computer <unk> on the digital assistant .
so i got myself busy , when is what of course or intuitive .
maybe even a look at it again .
why does that happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here shortly , we &apos;re moving from the third in the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern in the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through the language .
that means , you found , by making a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same cave , and in other areas , has created cities and has created so <unk> , and has created so <unk> .
the <unk> wasn &apos;t the language , but the language , something very natural , something very living .
in fact , you had to learn , so no toddler can talk about nature , but we learn it <unk> and diet .
this was then overtaken by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of script , which means what <unk> and alive , which is what <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to start it in stone and that also , i &apos;m <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a whole different narrative when if there &apos;s a alive of life .
but <unk> then moved to this script as <unk> , received .
then the next generation came in which we actually actually live primarily .
this is just that by pressure and <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time that was the same thing that was as a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , you know , if the people starts to read , and that is of course <unk> .
and now we come into the next generation and that exciting is so exciting , so a <unk> is only all of a hundred years and we &apos;re actually in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re involved in .
that of course , this is confused , because we see on the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with complete transparency , what the new thinking is , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking does , don &apos;t say that in the ancient <unk> , don &apos;t tell more , or other phenomena , which is , i want to just <unk> and want to <unk> that .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more on local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global code .
not when i think of locally and the neighbor thinks less green , that doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that means , from the local village , actually , is actually a global village with the same principles , so , of course , as intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village at the time , who has what to whom and when , this is what this expansion is about this expansion of our self through this mobile level .
be that we &apos;ve got to know global and over and always , and always , they have better .
so as it used to look at the early village .
in front of the background , i just looked at me just to look at what does it mean for us , which is , of course , what is , of course , what we might have , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what does for us , what makes the difference ?
because often people come , you can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with that , which means that , and not just just change it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when , of course , , of course , something is intuitive and how can i take influence , and just according to the things that they &apos;re a <unk> , so as intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun , because then they &apos;re easy to use .
you then keep busy thinking , also during the study of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what , of course , where you start and look at that and says , okay , now i just look at the inner self .
and how does it actually look out there ?
so how do we work if we <unk> there ?
and what does mean , of course , is , of course , intuitive and how do our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work <unk> ?
because steve jobs have said , you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at detail , if i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , what does that mean in the core .
and there you can see that you have a our seven sense , most of us , most of us are just seven , in fact , there &apos;s been seven , in fact , in the near future , the next time , and as extension , even in our self .
and to look , how process we process information , how do we take information ?
say alone , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use of the word , you don &apos;t know what it means to take into detail .
but i have to understand in the core , in the way , understand when information is going to information , when going to information information , and from information , knowing how i can also intuitive , or of course , to be intuitive or of course .
and of course , as design creates influence on perception .
we see this here when i made things , then i can make them confusing to the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make you kind of intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a vessel , but i can kind of see directly , where is salt and pepper in there .
and when i say someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to start thinking , where is what &apos;s inside .
and the left just access to the left and then hopefully , that no sugar is in there , the salt as well .
but also our perception itself itself , how makes it fool us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equally according to the size , and yet our perception , depending on what the context we <unk> things .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s no way to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle starts to relate or associate .
and if i still stop a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t just look at any more one , which is a unit , and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
something is called <unk> or just <unk> , which also influenced us in perception .
important for the creator for the creator , they have the mostly in the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the continuity , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
often at the third then , again .
but that &apos;s a essential component to , if you just want to design things very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting that &apos;s very interesting .
sound really sounds quite banal , is so exciting if you &apos;re closer to that .
so we have the front of the eyes and now think we &apos;re looking at the front of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back of the back .
because they <unk> an assumption that you can see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
this means , we &apos;re just <unk> to see our eyes before we see it back to the back in our <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s also there , this is also coming back .
then again , it goes back to the front , because that &apos;s the back of the front of the front , and says , well , well , well , i &apos;m going to see what you see , also , what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how certain things happening and in what to happen for <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s known from you this picture .
there is exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who what what &apos;s what you see .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , exactly .
if i saw this once that there is a <unk> in there , you know that .
they will never forget , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , now you always see him .
that means i &apos;ve actually spoiled them in fact that they don &apos;t recognize them , that they don &apos;t recognize them , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> within a very short picture of seeing this <unk> picture .
and this is these projection of vision , <unk> , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to give up to the front that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so all , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray is not actually , but here in this <unk> mass just happening .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i kind of kind of in the present in the present , and then i can also bridge very well <unk> in which i &apos;ve always been able to deal with three seconds .
this has to process it only process as present .
then it moves into the past and so i can bridge very elegant <unk> to the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a completely interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you love in love .
that means , warning , if you know that , you know , if you look at how long look at how long look at how long , because i don &apos;t conceive of the <unk> for what can happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a completely interesting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions of the sense we have .
this means , this first idea is happening in a rapid speed , how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re kind of <unk> ourselves against our environment , so we can look at that accordingly .
of course , the creator of course , not only with the theme of perceptions and neural <unk> or neural <unk> , but primarily with the theme of the <unk> .
so , like a person is a human with certain things .
there &apos;s once <unk> the practical functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> where i know exactly where i actually get to grab .
but there are also symbolic functions , why is someone for such a little <unk> , where hardly anything <unk> , so much of these <unk> money on money , even though it isn &apos;t so practical ?
there we are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , with which we have to deal with ourselves as a creator .
back to my actual subject of natural users and the topic , what of course <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> means always , how can i get to a certain goal or how to get a user in a particular <unk> solution , efficient and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s how it tells us the norm .
how can i make something more <unk> ?
i can use that right , or i need to do that right manual , or i need the right training for that .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i just make this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you also have to understand that .
and if you get to part of the software that we just saw , and look at that , you &apos;re going to understand why <unk> percent of our current software is little intuitive or not more intuitive , including <unk> , including <unk> , including it much more intuitive than a classic software .
this is intuitive <unk> not only since apple was an fundamental <unk> , <unk> primary <unk> , if i &apos;d like to harness technology devices of people available .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re using through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user is <unk> , for example five times in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that , if you do something of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new way of the natural software just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably can get four hours to go home , but your employers or someone &apos;s going to take them up with the four hours .
but i want to say that it is for us to be a corresponding <unk> , of course , to produce some things .
when we go back again in the realm of software , here &apos;s so the first <unk> line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing came up now , which has already been a <unk> neural model or mental model as the software is <unk> , which is a notion of something , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but just a metaphor .
that made the whole bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s also still much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so there i &apos;m designing as a lot more common , which looks like this .
this is also such a paradigm shift .
that i think that this is always <unk> for the success , just <unk> a app .
and if i then take a step back in this natural user interfaces , where i have a voice to voice , by language , by <unk> , by a language , by <unk> , by <unk> , by the time , and no longer have to control the things , then i &apos;m more faster and still on .
that &apos;s also going to lead me back to the point , when will the things become more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and look , what does that mean from the view of the <unk> , when is really something too intuitive ?
and this is for us people is always something intuitive when i just have to think about it .
so seemingly seemingly thinking , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s pretty simple .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means when we look at that we can use existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as a creator .
that means , i can just transfer an intuitive , human <unk> on a software and so that the software is substantially <unk> .
now , of course , the question , what is actually so the <unk> <unk> of us and now i &apos;ve been telling .
this is the so-called <unk> .
that &apos;s using each of us and <unk> is an acronym and is an acronym , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
that does all of you all the time , but he makes it <unk> and it &apos;s actually intuitive or partly instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world at the world and old , and is used by us all the time , without the whole time that most people knew this model is there .
<unk> <unk> on themselves , about 50 to <unk> times of us , so in their sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s then less often <unk> than a day .
i can now see this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar like with the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than that the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i put this up now , for example , i &apos;m orient to the orient , for example , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the case , i can look at it in detail , and yes , <unk> is , i can also send that somewhere or send someone to go somewhere or so on .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i try that again by a <unk> .
so everyone has already eaten pies .
here now , i interact with the object , can go back to the object , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of this , can now filter this and can say , show me all the thing with chocolate for chocolate .
and have a interface in once , which is much more intuitive and very much natural .
because that i can grab things like the pieces , <unk> , and they can come to me , is significantly more natural than if about <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms or other mechanisms or other mechanisms .
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i want to be able to be able to be able to get on new solutions , and in that sense , thanks to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to leverage you to a very certain aspect of curiosity .
the first thing , if you become a child as a child , as baby , is that they &apos;re going to take care of what you have , right ? and ever after , if their parents allow you to have to play , more or less , , the more , the more , they &apos;re going to go , of course , going to paint their curiosity .
and curiosity is not learning .
so , all of those who are here are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk to me now , basically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give , + give up two grams phosphorus , and every day you have to take two gram phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we can &apos;t take phosphorus phosphorus and make .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;ve got to engage here with something , which would actually be a <unk> , but not that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and now now , through the <unk> world , in the world , in the world , in the world , as in all <unk> .
alone in the last 20 years , <unk> tons are distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take all on .
it makes leukemia with children .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
that &apos;s not not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , it only takes three times more than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think of that from the <unk> to the <unk> , then our whole earth will be used to be in or later a cemetery .
therefore , from the <unk> to think of <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> saved .
in the moment , we &apos;re building corn and 30 kilograms 30 tons per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare , or <unk> <unk> .
that means we lose in the ground about five times more than new educated .
we can see , of course , look at the <unk> .
and everything is <unk> or content .
in <unk> , for example , at the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> by the <unk> now .
and because we &apos;re older , that &apos;s the diapers .
that &apos;s you all in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
we could reduce that to 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here one of the evidence that men are no pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted at the slow components of that .
people about the urine about the urine .
yes .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is shown with that , right ?
traditionally we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you get the people when you have the people to exist , if you say that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you will be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you tell you when you <unk> a lifetime , you <unk> the earth .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then , the ants are about four times more than we people .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody may like termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they work a lot harder than we and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , correspond to their weight in its weight , in the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to get out of what we really wanted to achieve and could , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re going to see on the earth at all , you can see that , for example , <unk> a program to be here , right ?
you can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we sit dumber than the trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully , yes , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still in the <unk> still six hundred billion trees .
you &apos;ve already heard something of <unk> from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we sit dumber than the trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , allow us to go back to our own <unk> .
every year , we lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really would go back into the loops .
and that &apos;s where we are too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> and as they &apos;re all called that our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to what <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes around the environment , that &apos;s the highest , not to be there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can just have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we do in brazil agriculture in where we get the nutrients back .
right , we can put nutrients on this way and way nutrients in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re going directly to take the waste directly .
in china , a <unk> today is still <unk> , like , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to <unk> our nutrients .
that means that the whole western <unk> draws by that the city always has taken , but the farmers never have been something back .
by using the cities , the cities had to grow more because the farmers were going into the cities and the cities had to bring their nutrients .
so all of the western rich are always expanding until they have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five years because you always were able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you invited to dinner in china , you expect to stay for the food that you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see in the internet how to regain the nutrients .
that actually &apos;s really beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture generates , on a hectare of land , with five thousand people in favelas , can be able to produce chickens and pig , and the facility are going to grow and pig and ducks and vegetables and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas to go back about ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people , as much bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is of course <unk> , but the facilities carry itself .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so through the design that can easily operate a farmer .
that means that &apos;s going to go back .
and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve been built now over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities ever got <unk> .
they could just easily <unk> a liter of <unk> and then the device would be ruined about years .
don &apos;t find instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , as much bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , they &apos;re writing on , in germany , in the best process plants that is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> .
because the <unk> facility could best regain the phosphorus back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s absolutely successful .
we &apos;ve been used in holland now over three years .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need that overall .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> worldwide .
there is opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace by other energy .
but the phosphorus will not replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s not about making existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mostly to ask , what is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in the netherlands , you understand that , of course , because in holland is the land on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad is sad if you &apos;re sad , and they come with 50 &apos;s roses .
totally inefficient .
but completely effective , yes , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six point of <unk> of their life .
this .
that &apos;s not exactly not exactly accurate because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> will .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but completely effective , yes ?
a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
therefore , not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not , the <unk> still is a little better to burn and put it up to <unk> the whole materials for cycles , but first to lose the whole materials for drugs , but first to ask , how do you make these cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i <unk> them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with <unk> and a glass of water to do that .
wonderful , &apos; right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
this means , everything , what counts in life is not going to prevent it to reduce .
the whole <unk> .
we say people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green green in the south .
no , this is exactly the right , right ?
at each place , where you &apos;re <unk> , from , yes , you create <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in how we think of the north .
there &apos;s everybody there is <unk> .
when they walk , everybody destroys the footprint the floor .
because just the floor is going to die from the mosses , and the wind and the water washing the ground away .
if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means that the water is that the water remains in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a marsh .
not <unk> .
we say in germany , in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how are you so about your wife ?
what do you tell ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not save , avoid , avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , as the people in the high bow of the car is that , right ?
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , for example , that &apos;s a liquid at temperature &apos;s a liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand up .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
and they contains seeds of rare plants , so that they contribute through the throw biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , there are two cycles .
not all of course will be <unk> .
a tv washing or a washing machine , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that must be so that they have to go in biological systems .
the things that only become used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
quite direct ads , and not for the company <unk> per se , but for that , that they &apos;re now helping this business to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t make the things more freely from it .
yes ?
so , if i put them down to food and say , that &apos;s free from <unk> , then you don &apos;t help you all .
no , we lay out what &apos;s in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
but everything in what &apos;s in there is useful .
these are the first shoes that they can <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> and the rubber band can go , right ?
everything is <unk> of it .
and if it works , of course , it &apos;s going to work for <unk> , for nike and <unk> and the whole textile industry with .
and this is the half of all the <unk> in the world that causes through the textile industry .
so that &apos;s why they help , questions at the people .
hey , <unk> , power are your really serious ?
because that has already changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not so sure if they really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit of it .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s what just been shown .
this goes .
we can do the things now that they do , if they <unk> , when they <unk> , they can use biological cycles .
technical cycles is just as well .
there &apos;s one direct <unk> .
this is the first environmental backpack , actually , that &apos;s done to go back into the circulation .
also that , so in every store you can <unk> things .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
when the waste is waste .
this <unk> rum , this <unk> rum , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there on the front of the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , you can move back to <unk> , then she can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia , <unk> trees .
yes ?
alone if they take these <unk> , they <unk> , sterile , and the powder to plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , already at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
that &apos;s what we can do .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started to set up an institute .
now , many people work there , and they &apos;re all engaged in them .
there is extra a club to get <unk> , where everybody is involved .
so no longer save , avoid , avoid , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description to my talk , that i wrote as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so in the english <unk> , understand .
<unk> are translator heard the written notes in <unk> music .
that you don &apos;t just communicate as a word for word the text into another language in a other language , but also to understand the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , so it has to understand a good translation , everybody who has to do it with <unk> .
to translate out of the germans into english , can require more knowledge , because it &apos;s when it &apos;s about poetry or even about poetry .
illegal is illegal to <unk> what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just got the written of the written notes .
you think , you know that the composer in the notes is exactly what he was thinking there .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about the same or <unk> , like a verbal , if there seems very seemingly <unk> accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> is the smell of flowers doesn &apos;t smell to smell , the degree of the <unk> only to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
this means , the interpreter of this <unk> use this <unk> data into another , which is <unk> , non-verbal <unk> .
today i want to translate you to do something else , so <unk> , even once in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me equivalent to the translation of translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be just able to read notes and make keys on the piano or the right hand on a <unk> .
namely , this is just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the letter of letters you can see , if you can do the language .
so , you need for the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively understands or you also can be active , to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> begins similar to like the one <unk> .
after you start to play a piece of a piece , because you &apos;ve chosen to play it , you &apos;re going to go out to backgrounds to backgrounds .
you accumulate information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers itself .
you studied the works that he created before and after later .
you put comparisons .
the <unk> to write it .
how and what does he feel ?
how were the circumstances of the society and politics and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at this time , looking at literature .
with the time , you &apos;ve also been a rich knowledge to know the composers that you play more often over , and it &apos;s always easier to be easier to <unk> and feel .
the composer will always get more to my friend that you live together .
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more and more to my personal cause to play it .
there &apos;s all other notes in the cause of the composers of composers , but just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make it again and meaning to <unk> .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these notes might have to mean .
now for me and for the composer , and what they could mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of making a sense , because i feel it himself because it comes from my now personally .
it has to be for me in here and now being <unk> , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed as long as new as new .
how to rethink a happy new day again , although always with the same rituals of life , up with the same rituals of life , stand up to work , so as well , i also go back to the same thing again .
i &apos;ve become a day older that seasons move seasons to evening , my pulse goes slower when the morning , takes it longer that the sound is coming back as to home .
i take the breath of the audience , aware or unconsciously .
all that influences me and all that influenced my experience with the composition of the composition .
absolutely wonderful is when i stand with a <unk> on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea in and immediately , this answers will with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and whatever you can &apos;t have samples .
it makes great fun to make music , and they were when the audience communicates , as the music communicates alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i will never play more , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as in 20 years .
there i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and therefore , on my palette of the <unk> of <unk> , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , also <unk> , but this is new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and long-term professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet him very early with 13 years , and so i was at my school classes on his classes .
i was 17 , when i took on one of his courses again , and played the last of the four movies by chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
that &apos;s so a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
there he <unk> and meant , so ?
that must be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you just have more dreams , but no significant memories .
i play this piece today , and i &apos;ve always gone back to me , and always changed for me , although no single grade .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
one example of it from a completely different area . monet &apos;s painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he was translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she looked at it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
now , i was also older as chopin with <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he was only lived by <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look at the notes , even when i mean , you memorize .
to hold <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially if he died already .
now , how do you start talking to speak the language of music ?
i said , yes , you need about just as long as the spoken language .
often the <unk> is that you just learn the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to read that before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right as it is going into the notes , then it comes out of the notes that sound together as music .
if that &apos;s ubiquitous , the students get the <unk> piece on .
interpretation of interpretation will barely talk in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s good , there &apos;s a fast piece .
<unk> , slowly .
according to and <unk> , f and b , et .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
but even when you put this data , it still remains something technical .
and yet it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you don &apos;t forget something completely <unk> .
which is that , to make music on the instrument that can do and feel available before .
that &apos;s where this is singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that didn &apos;t have learned because it doesn &apos;t be <unk> , it will not do by itself .
that &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have it over another way , so about an instrument that sound .
people who never sing out , have never felt immediately with the own body , as it is to form a note .
a phrase with his own breath .
the musical system is because that &apos;s the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm out of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do more yourself , if it gets an bored .
no longer required to whistle a <unk> or singing .
every own music will <unk> when you &apos;re constantly going from the outside with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if if i didn &apos;t sing , if i didn &apos;t sing ?
that &apos;s the question i can &apos;t sing , a , because they don &apos;t have to sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to figure out whether they can &apos;t yet , or learn how to do these little muscles that are <unk> the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s where you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> .
there i ask , how <unk> competently was this diagnosis ?
have you already put a <unk> or <unk> , how to say it today ?
or d , you may don &apos;t like music , and therefore , to do a failure .
but what i would actually do is regret because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , so you see , on all cases , no one must be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you also say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
there i say , but sure , you can say it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says someone , i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of no food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to prevent in classical music because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to consciously and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is about <unk> or too cute .
tell what you feel .
with the time , they also get claims and want to get something more spices , or taste even fine differences .
why do i challenge now from my audience that it also listening to ?
because the music is a language and a language is communicating .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the food that &apos;s going from a chef or a chef and a chef has to be eaten and not just looked at them or not just look at recipes .
so please listen to if a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in a environment , where the adults are actively doing music or at least active music , a child is going to be a child , then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , to ask what color is your flower ?
can you actually play them now in blue ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds quite different than before .
that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a piece of today that &apos;s originally a hundred , <unk> or before <unk> three years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have <unk> .
there was the instrument of the time bach didn &apos;t even have the piano .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had the <unk> possibilities of the modern <unk> .
i can see today the <unk> that bach had had to sound on the modern wing , which is not a <unk> <unk> .
also from beethoven knows that he heard more than he was already deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time as <unk> .
that &apos;s why the composers of us rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;ll become audible by what they just imagined in the mind .
and also what you would think of today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what they might have thought .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they jealous ?
and how did that feel about ?
suck .
i have a friend , which drives a <unk> .
if i come up , with my little v w , and i &apos;m wrong to ask , this feeling comes up .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do so n big car ?
that &apos;s already lost half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford so n little car ?
and then i immediately fall out , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward sense .
our organism has invented a great method to get the same uncomfortable emotion as envy just to disappear .
you can also try this also with words like revenge or <unk> .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or something that is what you &apos;re unconscious probably is familiar with .
the mechanism comes out of the lie .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard you might have heard when people say , nobody has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them the view .
in a lie , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to verify that he &apos;s completely different in mind .
he &apos;s just fooling you and not themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with that , that they deceive themselves .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a self-deception .
they can get them less easily , yes , <unk> or also get down .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> once a woman <unk> .
this woman has afterwards , the portrait would not look like her at all .
picasso says , wait just .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
on this point , and when you laugh , they realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artists show you something with , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see , if they just look at the mirror .
the artists share you in a such portrait of what they &apos;re just familiar with , if they &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork over again .
then this awkward sense disappears , it could not look very similar , and it &apos;s always more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to <unk> our <unk> .
and not just in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it appeared again .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful at the country ?
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true reasoning , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true language .
but we should just feel familiar with that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there is a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s it necessary , which we understand under <unk> <unk> , over again .
we need to have this point to this lie that <unk> us the deception , without which we can &apos;t live at all .
we don &apos;t just have just in art , in the <unk> , but also in the science of science .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of people .
that the man from the monkeys should <unk> and , yes , it &apos;s at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said that &apos;s not true what charles there writes .
the person is supposed to be from monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not going .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that the people know the most of it .
why do we need to prevent people from something when it is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we get these self-deception to be great , this feeling , from the highest being , not from one such <unk> , from such a organism , from such a organism , which exists to that , which is something like a organism , which is something like an organism , which is for us <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t have these things .
we need to prevent that people learn from things , especially when they are true .
so you can see how slow that mechanism out and like the traces , which is leaving on something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to see you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife has told her .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them by a student .
a 16-year-old student .
they love him special because he has a tendency to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen .
and because i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> on this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said my wife , always when a person in a moral factor is because use , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
that &apos;s the interest for <unk> .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
there he signed up .
and <unk> , you also say his teacher doesn &apos;t tell his teacher that you like to put fire somewhere , and i &apos;m glad when the fire is <unk> .
no , it just sees a lot better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge to eliminate the risks , the other thing if they just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> on that , that in the <unk> of the <unk> knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell that loud .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and consciousness , which is immediately <unk> , without what you can do about it , and the things that you know about , and the things you know is that they can be much better for you and others .
so just then , just like these words , that we &apos;re also using in the language of the politically correct feedback .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know when we tell that , the social narrative is very disturbed very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that works to work .
i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones we actually know in unconscious knowledge that they &apos;re valid to spread out .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example releases what many of you are familiar and some of them , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so something more intellectual , says about leibniz .
she &apos;s something that is not <unk> , physical physical physical physical physical physical .
and if you have people who have the solid conviction that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have a soul , or you can also say that the soul is such from meat to life , and you can also say that the soul is just from meat and blood , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead .
and from that soul , you &apos;re now thinking that they kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> is it in the latin , the <unk> , your mind .
and when this <unk> then <unk> over the people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is so the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as a little sense of what to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we experience this happiness , through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> you know still from school .
this is now a <unk> that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something , but also the willingness to lie .
which is so to lie that they simply can use this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i stuck here in particular .
a third sentence , which is immediately appearing at people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
who say , who has no soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say nothing .
and here you feel it already .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logical correct .
because i can claim everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any tells the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;re right , then the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but critically , if i have right , then it &apos;s just true .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness is immediately able to make it something .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences and doing that , as if that &apos;s the opposite of the first sentence already proved and assumed .
because actually , we have to prove , whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses it that two sentences is correctly , and a third <unk> that looks like this , so he can have something that looks like that , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do that as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things at different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example of that that keeps filling up the <unk> .
this is what you have to do , one more <unk> topic , a <unk> from philosophy , present .
this has to do that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was johannes <unk> and after that is the <unk> <unk> named <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which consists of pure nature .
that doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is so a <unk> .
and if you place exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack is going to go first .
so he says exactly in the middle .
that &apos;s how the <unk> introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately bring that a haystack bigger , then he doesn &apos;t need sense and all of it .
he automatically runs on the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven in nature , so , of the larger pile that put a immediately dressed in , then they also have a feeling like a free will have to give .
and if we &apos;ve also been here in <unk> on the <unk> , then i remember the <unk> for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars , the wolf <unk> , and by him , you sometimes say , wolf <unk> claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence and can say , if wolf <unk> is right , then he has no <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper that you find that in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , can &apos;t be able to be pulled for its actions and claims to responsibility and he &apos;s so <unk> .
also here you have it again .
actually , you &apos;d have to have to have to have to figure out whether it &apos;s like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it , so to do as the first sentence of the work is wrong , as you would have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just just do if you want to make ourselves anything , if you want to test themselves , and especially when they want people to make people happy to practice the lie .
practice that for example , if you look at one people that you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , that &apos;s called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little political <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one , for course , <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re engaged with that , they &apos;re not allowed to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man completely happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he led them to a <unk> , on which he doesn &apos;t get themselves .
because actually , this person is not interested in prove .
he &apos;s just interested in that , even <unk> in front of the need to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the way , in the way , you experience the magnificence of the lie of the lie .
and when you have a possibility again to feel this <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed me to have <unk> if i may mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event and has asked me whether i want to hold a talk here and my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it fell hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think maybe my <unk> that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s of course the sum of all , quite many ideas .
i probably &apos;m probably one of these are the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been made for this bad sensory image , because i &apos;ve already started studying robots in <unk> , technical school , today , she means i believe , kit .
and i got to berlin to berlin , because i wanted to make renewables , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were all <unk> , also the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot line today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but something like &quot; n <unk> , made out of which sort of a hundred watts from the square square , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m thankful to the <unk> that he had the word back again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad .
but that was not that in the <unk> years .
there was just that it was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you thought that evil suspects .
the place of the <unk> , but this was called <unk> and he made wind and the sun and there i started the middle of the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s told today , touches me very , because many , many beautiful statements were that i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one was no said , the <unk> , this was a completely <unk> . i &apos;ve got 10 years to get out of that , if i &apos;ve always got my great <unk> to a <unk> thing , because also , all the colleagues of my father would always <unk> him , you have the money to the window in your child .
it &apos;s preoccupied with insanity .
and that was really very , very , very <unk> and you also come into this same stage in such a period , a picture in <unk> , where i asked me after 10 years , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the collective of course , if that really should be that great .
and i &apos;ve got it up to <unk> , and then we went together with friends with friends , i &apos;ve become <unk> of the company that was taken together with the <unk> <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but also , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a small group , and that means that we &apos;re going to go back and go back and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to go back to the time that people &apos;s going to say , that &apos;s not about store .
and there i brought you a project that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewables .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where you could use a memory for a memory today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s so the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
that just is simply technologically technologically .
when they <unk> more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
this is also what i always tell you the politicians when she <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , but not , we have seven percent and our web is physically , the european one .
if we would have in europe in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , which was <unk> , got the first contacts with the island , calculate , simply by it .
how big would have to be a battery , so you have to be such a battery , so you &apos;re like an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewables .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred <unk> , about a hundred <unk> on <unk> <unk> on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear plants , because this is particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that occurs with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission to get permission .
this is fast .
you put such a box .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
in that always run three of the <unk> , two will always be waiting .
yes , this is where one that is down the burden .
we also get very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is a <unk> system or a system , which can just <unk> in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel will <unk> <unk> and the wind , sun controls the burden so that they can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables a year , so energy a year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn the diesel off the street .
that means , in the moment , you have to worry that the renewables can actually take the whole web .
that &apos;s obviously , of course , if you &apos;re going to have a staff system .
this has so none of the world .
that &apos;s in the small scale , so you can also use your <unk> over a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s already happening .
if you want to take several of these <unk> <unk> , and that should build a web , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was very , we wanted to go up on 70 to ninety percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another one , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable with that is going to be very , very expensive and that will not work that you &apos;re doing that from batteries .
that &apos;s going to be a energy fuel , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know or <unk> , that will be it .
you &apos;ve got to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going with a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there at all ?
and then have a whole lot of simulations .
and have wind and sun and the load of load and the burden of <unk> and came to the outcome , a very interesting result that you have a middle <unk> of about 50 cents a <unk> per <unk> per <unk> , about 50 cents out of <unk> cents .
this was the very first calculation of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> when the <unk> five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would to be done ?
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build one to rebuild society again .
and here again , the plot .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we have to make 20 percent with diesel and also <unk> a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the island , has meant that we find very great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build an hall in berlin , in which we kind of <unk> the electric narrative of the island in the scale of the area .
that means we &apos;ve got looking for first to find the biggest battery of the world .
here you is .
that comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is she in the &apos; 70s at the &apos; 70s at the &apos; 70s , today <unk> , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you &apos;re able to see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can make six hours long , and this is the battery that we have kind of <unk> <unk> .
and then they put up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he stands there to the hall of this web , so in the back , it looks like this whole dynamic behavior of this web , so in the back , this is the big amount of behavior , here &apos;s the big battery that we simulate the web .
here we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to represent the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we also can also <unk> kilowatts on the web .
here we see this again again , again , the diesel , here again , all the individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done since <unk> , the hall then finished , until today , <unk> basically , what here is between the individual system of electronics , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is only between the topic and the theme web and everything in between .
you have to go to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is about the theme that you &apos;re basically taking on this island , basically , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back at the moment and <unk> , <unk> , how to go to the island , we have <unk> the wind , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
<unk> then offers <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can already start to integrate <unk> in the island , <unk> , you can manage the burden .
that means when you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you will not make that without memory .
you can <unk> through &apos; n , you can pull nets by <unk> , yes , that should be doing in any case , but you will never get on memory completely .
and that &apos;s like the message .
so many people come and look at that , just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the diesel , you just have no longer this spinning mass that causes a certain inertia on the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just taken out of louder masses of large <unk> , wherever the wave is everywhere around europe .
we look at this web , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s <unk> point nine hertz , we start a couple of <unk> <unk> , we start a couple of <unk> <unk> , then again , we come up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly rough .
if you <unk> that somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve at least 10 seconds to hold the web stable .
and in the time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that more , this spinning mass , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can have two milliseconds of two milliseconds .
there &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see what enormous <unk> there is there .
and the message is now , we need to dispense on this rotating masses , if we &apos;re sort of with our goals 20 , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t want to , or <unk> , because that doesn &apos;t go .
and we &apos;re simply trying to try that you can break the capacity that can degrade the capacity , they can degrade by electrochemical memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to this purpose , the people are going to come and look at our <unk> on that , basically our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can <unk> a piece of a long future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
not , isn &apos;t rotten , <unk> , we have everything out , human beings never .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that , that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity at <unk> the same capacity on the world .
very simple , that &apos;s going to come .
there will be such a lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve kind of experienced in the last two years , that the scientists put on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> , also , at the german government now , now to <unk> .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so from that , you also realize that there is a change there , and only from this <unk> , to the notion , a hundred percent renewables is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in arguments , these <unk> , those <unk> , who are doing a own little net , which has a own little net , that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
that the question is the question is quite simply if they &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> anywhere on the world and <unk> , they &apos;re an island .
then you only use that , which is at the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is so a little bit of our vision from a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve said the power of energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that , that &apos;s what we do , and in that , also , the talk of <unk> <unk> that you can be a collective and use energy , here a little together .
and yeah , i &apos;m just going to encourage you to just encourage you a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , that &apos;s los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , who played on a violin who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles about it later a book , which was <unk> , which was <unk> , and jamie <unk> as steve anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and whose promising career was stopped by his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend to read you all , <unk> book to read or look at the film , so they &apos;ve been able to understand the wonderful connectedness , but also how the music helped be made between these two men , but as she was allowed to get the instrument , the <unk> is to get the <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo ma and hillary and about how the dodgers would never create it into the baseball world . and that everything because of the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to the subject of music . and a few days later , i got an email , in the state that nathaniel were interested in <unk> at me .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel <unk> a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric electric treatment and with <unk> , a trauma that has followed him his whole life .
as a consequence of this , he &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . who are sometimes so bad to these schizophrenics , and he disappears in the streets of <unk> row , always that horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in exactly so , in exactly so a <unk> was nathaniel , when we first was with our first class in walt disney <unk> hall , he had this insane <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted him to poison in sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that he could break him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him to the violin , and that i could destroy him to the violin and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i played , i noticed that in <unk> eyes were a complete change .
it was , as if he stood under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response to my game was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding into plain curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin and started to play some clips of <unk> to play and asked me to finish them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , started to talk about beethoven , starting <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it also connected to her a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and spoke about music , was out of this <unk> , confused man , who just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because music allows him to make it , his thoughts and delusions with its imagination and creativity into something real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
exactly this is the reason why we do music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression gets us all , and moves , inspired and united us .
what nathaniel models , so he brought him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and him <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to go back to nathaniel music , no matter whether in walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i become musicians .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll pardon me .
so i have a lot of fish known in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was bred to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be feeling to sell him .
i had with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and asked if i could give you to an event , about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs is . how do we keep fish on our cooks ?
in the last 50 years , we have stood the oceans like we have beaten the forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments about this . <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , take up . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
also doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to make it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
don &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t grow the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will not focus out of our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and at that evening , i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t do what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said , he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask an opinion .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me a decent answer . until i finally <unk> with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him as well .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what is a sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and eating food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish at fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is me even .
no , i have <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish would tasted fish after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i &apos;ve eaten him first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she has sort of <unk> us .
he came up on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let a fish taste so good after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can be it .
call him <unk> . actually he means <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way that you and i understand underneath .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by turning the country .
they built this complicated result of channels , and they 300,000 water out of the country and beyond the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around what &apos;s a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , 1982 , bought a spanish company .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water around .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of using the water <unk> , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and building <unk> and his company completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they rigid out on the horizon that is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels and these density , voluptuous march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time before with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands , and i did <unk> and <unk> , had <unk> until my knees , and <unk> keeps a <unk> .
here he lifts a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of concentrate that &apos;s remembered by the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and dropping into more <unk> birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it make your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s so a wonderful system that the fish are eating , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the plankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm who doesn &apos;t sustain their animals ?
later , i went on on this site with <unk> and i asked him , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like any of course , like any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was as if a director would have a <unk> demands .
and we bow around the corner and us offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , one literally enough of the eye .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on the birds .
now , last year , there were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private community in all of europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing that you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp are eating the phytoplankton .
so the knees the better the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that &apos;s their success at the health of its predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , she flies 240 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced me a kind of trip of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , do you fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it back to the night ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was just quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i don &apos;t cook almost that .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last resistance before something into the body .
she has developed in the course of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures their success at success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that has no <unk> , which has no <unk> , because the water is flowing through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things with itself , of the rivers that tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow from <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves the water clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that literally measures their success , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , but not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take him , and that &apos;s what romantic are always , as romantic also , is <unk> .
you could say that they &apos;re a recipe for the future for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , actually taste good .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that are the future of good food , someone somewhere on and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to get the world more than only feed .
one billion people will be starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years .
feed grain at herbivores , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken , and the whole time has just asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we &apos;re just going to feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was that thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that allows quickly <unk> capital .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile country , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through the <unk> , but through <unk> and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to feed itself ?
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it and it never produced something really good to food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the environmental model .
this is that that &apos;s on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that don &apos;t be worlds for themselves , businesses , the recover instead of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> , who are not just <unk> , farmers who are not only people , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i really be honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i ever &apos;ll be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;d like to <unk> you today is that the totality of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking of <unk> , i want to think of that things as we can use information as we can use information so we can see patterns that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes itself .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are the most active and they are over here on the <unk> .
we can take one step further out and line the data then , and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we go further , and after old , we say 40 years , we &apos;ll see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents should even worry about people .
and who <unk> can see that is true in men .
so you realize that this is going to look at information and data in this way in this way in a lively <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data why not even for content themselves ?
what we now have here is the <unk> of every single &quot; sport <unk> , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in their suite .
with <unk> , she can dive in a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to go over here so i &apos;ll mention all of lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> overview , i could think &quot; okay , what if i look at everything with the topic of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and <unk> the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of it that if you &apos;re looking at this kind of information , more information , wider , <unk> , <unk> , then you &apos;re not looking for or not just <unk> .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little differently .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to take this idea now a little bit on with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and it reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short picture and a symbol for the area that she comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are on wikipedia at the most popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i chose &quot; government &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that are most at the most time <unk> people of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to realize when you go back to one step back and the whole thing .
walk on a certain of these summaries , i can then <unk> in the subject of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
if i now look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of it are <unk> . some of come from the science . some , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump and a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the web the first time as whether it &apos;s also a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what other things might be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can take websites with this -- and we bring this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step back , and right to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why that &apos;s why , because you just look at the look of websites in this way that can look at the whole <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course , in a certain time time .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i kept up to here .
and i can tell everything i &apos;ve seen today , again , <unk> .
and , if i take a step back , and i can look at everything , i can rearrange my course of my <unk> . here , i &apos;ve been looking for the <unk> , and here , i &apos;ve looked after bing labs , or here after live labs .
and from here , i can get into the side and you call them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and each time it makes the picture larger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking from the oscar curse .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation around and the internet on the head , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , and by making patterns , which would be otherwise hidden hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know , then we can even pull out <unk> out of it .
so i hear on , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school to school , every day an hour of an hour .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds and on <unk> ways my deep <unk> in me , <unk> curiosity .
these curiosity also showed in that i always was when i was not in school , over the forests , walked through the forests , wandered through the forests , frogs and dogs and <unk> , everything went home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it always went to try to understand the world and explore the limits of the way .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our eyes with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of miracles we showed us before .
that &apos;s probably really good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games yet to film these <unk> with <unk> the whole imagery , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . if we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was the drawing and paint of aliens , aliens , <unk> and all this stuff .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught by the teachers , as i was hiding , hidden .
that creativity had to get out .
and that happened something interesting . which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows the thought of a totally unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly i would never get an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could enter , here on the earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic as all of the things i &apos;ve always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided to get 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
of that , i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york had done , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of buffalo , new york .
but the ocean but , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 12,000 hours under water . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , very contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean holds on , with the same intensity as ever .
when i put a profession when i <unk> a profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best opportunity , my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a kid i drew constantly comic books and so .
so movies were able to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i put up , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could connect my preference for the <unk> and the diving with the filmmaking .
so , sort of related to my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we had to create on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out of that was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t put any money out , he just played his production costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was just as <unk> by the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , <unk> technology , and magic not different from each other .
so you saw something magic .
and that was what i found really exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even much further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on how this effect would be going .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have a little bit more money .
from these two experience , from these two experiences , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend stan , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
the basic idea of this company was to be the phase analog processes with visual printers etc and go and start with digital <unk> .
that &apos;s what we then did and managed to have a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we found in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve actually created the company -- too slowly .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; writing the bar of visual effects and <unk> effects into a visual effects and <unk> effects in very new heights , with much human , expressive characters that were made by <unk> . and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar hit very nicely , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to create that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that will fall .
the <unk> , i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet . &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but secretly , i wanted to <unk> the real wreckage of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m convinced you , but i believe , &quot; we dip to the wreckage . we film the real wreckage .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that , that your own imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian <unk> , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlantic and looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
that was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really blew me out .
and the preparedness were enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and everything .
and i fell on how much these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning .
you get up into this capsule , then you put into this dark , <unk> environment down where no hope of saving , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as well as i would be in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was literally obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could introduce me a creature for that we could make a visual effect . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
at some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had seen before and for the science at the time , when we saw them , even no words .
so that &apos;s really really <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i told me , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and will put for a while <unk> . &quot;
and then we started , we came up to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and exploring them with <unk> .
we returned to wreckage the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and herself to look at the inner of the ship which was never been done before .
no one had ever explored the interior of the <unk> . you had no resources for that . so we developed the process .
well , there i &apos;m sitting now on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is pretty similar and from which i know that once the band is played there .
and i have to fly with a little <unk> through the nearest of the ship .
i actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;d be physically within the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i took a corner of the <unk> of the vehicle , i always knew what &apos;s going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going around <unk> when we were the film .
because the set of set was an accurate copy of the driver &apos;s blueprints .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made me aware of this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk> and so consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really profoundly profound profound profound profound .
and maybe a little lens on that , which might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine myself as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started this , what we &apos;ve seen in there , for example , that <unk> , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help from <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a <unk> system , as we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and who are sitting in the space and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> and sit down to russia , go back to russia , and it &apos;s going to go to russia , then flies to the international <unk> and take our <unk> with them .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went beyond that i took <unk> to the deep sea .
i took them with and <unk> them up to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations . i took them to the vents , so i took them to <unk> , so they could test them and so on .
we were turned together , but actually , science , actually , in fact , <unk> .
so , the circle between my existence as <unk> , at the time as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of discovery of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m now thinking , a director also needs to lead a leader , a leader .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the production cost . by fame none .
all of you think i &apos;ve been being between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; touch , &quot; and &quot; touch the nails and would have <unk> the nails on one towel .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it around the task , to the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there is the <unk> environment that there is . you &apos;re doing it for the <unk> , and because of the strange group of people that creates a team of people a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on years . sometimes we were two to three months in a row on lake .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have , because you overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain one other .
if you go back to land , and says , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the whole technique , and the difficulty that you can &apos;t explain , and the difficulty that you can &apos;t explain . this is like police officers have been through and you know that you never can explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to go back to my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you hold his team and make their respect in return .
that &apos;s what really changed the dynamic .
so there i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain . we <unk> &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that it didn &apos;t have before .
very exciting .
an awful lot of challenge .
and we were got to a half for a half four and a half years .
it changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who said , we would have really good <unk> and transported on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of that ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think at first point is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , a young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
that &apos;s another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in the art and the study must fail to be an alternative , because there will guarantee it a <unk> .
no important endeavor that asked innovation was ever without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks to take out .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you with on the way .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise may be surprising to something , because my <unk> at the foundation mainly about vaccines and seeds to spin the things that we invent and deliver to the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , right even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing over many years . it &apos;s too much or too little rain . the things will change how it can &apos;t be their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
also , the <unk> for them is very important .
the fact is that if you could just reduce the price of the price , the <unk> would be far to the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> and therefore we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things do .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s leave the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- we meet a new barrier and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> the <unk> carbon dioxide , which leads to the <unk> and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> result , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes and so collapse systems .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and that <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some cards , but not very many .
and there &apos;s sure ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we have to get down to near zero ?
not enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different as to say , we &apos;ve got a 12 feet high truck , which has to be under a three feet bridge .
this is just to go down to zero .
well , we poke a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for each on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that reduce that on zero .
it &apos;s very constant .
just different economic changes have changed at all , and we need to go from <unk> rise to reducing and a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- that &apos;s going to bring out of the number of people , from the amount of people , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is going to be <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at each factor individually and think of how we get that on zero .
probably one of those numbers have to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it looks at nine billion <unk> that are going to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are , we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor are the services we use .
that &apos;s all , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means that these services are almost available on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make <unk> and less use , but in average , this number will increase every year and more than double the number of services that are provided to the number of services the person per person .
here we see a very profound service . is there to light light , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through other ways , through new ways , there are many services whose energy are giving some individual benefits to 90 percent .
in other service , such as the manufacturing of <unk> , 105 : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> or <unk> , is the resources for improvements .
in all , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction three or maybe even a factor sixth .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now going to go from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons . and that &apos;s simply not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor in -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out the question if you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn gas , no .
almost any <unk> for electricity nowadays , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to make on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i use the term &quot; miracles &quot; , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
usually you &apos;re like just wrong and some coming , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and have a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i get this out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year , when i got mosquitoes and somehow the people that .
the idea became really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell this one .
i decided that the back of fireflies was my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . actually , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t bring all of them .
we need solutions , either one or several who have an incredible scale of scaling and unimaginable for it , and even though there are many directions that people look for , i really see five things that can afford these big demands .
i have tides , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
this may be a <unk> contribution and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my statement here is that we need to give up all those five work , and we can &apos;t give you all of them because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there seems maybe just seem simple , but that &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that came out after burning , which comes down to burn from the <unk> , forming , and then hope , and hope it stays there .
there are some <unk> that can create that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get on 100 percent , is a big challenge for the supply of co2 , is a big challenge here .
who will make it sure ?
who can guarantee something , what literally many billion times bigger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
that also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after safety , you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are potentially soluble , and that you should work on .
the last three of the five of the five of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and also they have -- although it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
to one is the density that creates dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more area than a normal power station .
moreover , these sources of interruptions .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , she doesn &apos;t seem any day and just blows the wind all the time .
so you have to think if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , a way , the energy is also in times if they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges on transmission . if we say that the source source outside of the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk of where the energy of where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension to the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , and that &apos;s what the world uses , and that &apos;s what the world uses , for everything . and that &apos;s what the world uses the world , which is the world that we &apos;re doing now , less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this happens when you &apos;re trying to do this <unk> sources about saying , 30 percent of the wind .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i believe here in the ted group there are a lot to get involved there .
bill big has several companies , including one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies that make great things and have interesting ways and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach is following .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry at some time , so there &apos;s no great surprise that some good concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had been thinking about that long , but you could never simulate reasonable whether it would work , but since since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , with the right <unk> , it looks like this , it looks like that .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the <unk> is very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today than <unk> .
instead of breaking your head , burn it , burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is incremental , a little like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; traveling reactor reactor reactor reactor reactor
that really solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
this <unk> u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to achieve and then let &apos;s talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully <unk> and cement is <unk> and cement .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note says if we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s super important .
that will be a key feature of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should that look testimony ?
it should have the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reducing on the way . the less we &apos;re going to get down , the smaller , and also the temperature also will be the temperature .
but actually , this note is to the things we are doing , which we don &apos;t lead to the big <unk> , just right , or even something less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to test these breakthroughs with <unk> and that we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
that al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> energy <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework in which this can be discussed , because we need for all sides .
there are a lot that has to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very productive wish that we invent this technology .
if you only take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that love i could choose , or i could pick this wish , and i could take this wish , and i could take this wish , i would take that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig in between the long-term and <unk> thinking people are awful , between the u.s. and china , between the united states and rich and rich and rich , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what things do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss these <unk> and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to take dialogue <unk> and lead full and the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand <unk> something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works sensible , you only have into the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> to find more billion to find more billion and the place of actually build the first of it .
as soon as the first finished , when he promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the profit , the density is so different as at <unk> as we know them .
to understand the right : this means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear <unk> and then the process begins the process and then works further down ?
<unk> : right . today , you have to rethink the reactor over , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go awry . this thing where you &apos;re opening and things <unk> . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think about a plank -- which they bury , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years long , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that offers itself a solution for garbage .
<unk> : yes . now , what happens with the garbage : you can sit there -- there &apos;s much less garbage with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste that has already exists in this <unk> or <unk> at the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so this is what &apos;s a problem for that reactors , which is what we fill in our own and that is going to dramatically reduce the <unk> during this process .
but while they talked about different people of this world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t put us on a place and there &apos;s a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s wearing the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve talked to the <unk> and talked about how this fits to <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , that &apos;s why everyone who built a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your notion , <unk> and probability and likelihood of being really into life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to make .
this is kind of the deadline that have demonstrated us the <unk> that we need to drive .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be that easy to hold it .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies that work , as if their approaches work for their pilots to work for their pilots to <unk> .
and it would be best if there would be multiple people , because then you could use a mixture .
on any case , we need a solution .
the big possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would also be without the <unk> , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems something difficult , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty of this is that a <unk> has a million times so much energy , as one , if you can deal with the problems , and so , if they can deal with the problems and the cost , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league , almost in a league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and shortly before a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or similar .
there &apos;s a <unk> which is called <unk> , which is working with various techniques to <unk> the warming , so we had 20 or 30 years longer to <unk> us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at all of the insurance because one that you might go further , so you eat , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you lead to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> if the things come to , if the things come faster , or this innovation longer , as we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for that , to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that are doing with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of problems to invest in something that you have to invest in something later , and there &apos;s people in the world that is not so clear . actually , the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that that uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make economic , and at the same time , the skeptics can do , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t care that it &apos;s no co2 , i wish that it &apos;s no co2 , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are fighting by malaria and so on , that there is a dumb waste of resources , and so on that there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources that we can do .
<unk> : now , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
below , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you get to big <unk> , and here can disagree sensible people , if you have something that doesn &apos;t be economically , and tries to fund this . for me , for me , the most of the waste .
it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded only the curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much less cheaper .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> , then only you can keep up the rich .
i mean , everybody from us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why is the research not talking more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he takes the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to be the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about a meter tape , about a meter tape , about a meter and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it really seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it &apos;s pushing people very fast .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since since since since , i conducted about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and there is something about this task , and there &apos;s something about this task , and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people begin to orient itself to the orient .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look like it , they <unk> .
then you put a little time in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti sauce out .
they invest a lot of your time in the <unk> constantly <unk> structures .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time , taking the marshmallow and they put him gently down to the top , step back and you put him gently back .
but then what happens is , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; is because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more , <unk> <unk> than others , and under the worst is fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there &apos;s also teams that have a lot more , &quot; <unk> &quot; and among the best is fresh students of <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how does this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids invested in the spaghetti of spaghetti of spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then him to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> is doing is that you start with the marshmallow and put prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that she went into <unk> prototypes .
<unk> shows this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each attempt , the kids get immediate feedback what works and what not .
so the performance to work with prototypes , significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most lies in about <unk> , <unk> create half of that , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three is the highest , what i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator on the team , will be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they lead the process , you understand him .
and that team who fall down and look at the work will be significantly improving of the teams .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the characteristic , you get about six that have robust structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> $ software for the winner .
what did you think happened with this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened here . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price for home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practice with the same student .
what happened now ?
now she understood the benefit of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so , out of the same , worse team one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are so <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i can help digital tools and processes to make teams to help cars , cars and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is , they helps you identify of hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or ethos to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple practice .
and those of you who &apos;s interested in it can be <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe , this is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task and that we use our thinking optimal as our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that lies before .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience everything it needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we do such as we have a machine .
a big machine , a big , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room must be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in the time before there were cars or twitter or , &quot; america &apos;s looking for the idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you somehow get to <unk> , to <unk> .
and that i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that doesn &apos;t because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that had ever been on this planet , no matter how scale they do : health , wealth , mobility , declining <unk> .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> died all of them when they were 60 .
my grandparents filed this number on <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new new new delhi , as long as the richest man on the world around 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way , how it has ever done war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . pop .
in the rich world , diseases exist that millions of us have even threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does somebody even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , which are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is going to try things , look at whether it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people on this world every day to bed every day .
that number goes up , and she goes very quickly , and this is embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world very thoroughly .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t break out of this chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think already .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the land that they live to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is no <unk> .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we also were also able to be able to get him sensible , as we can see it today .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events on many areas . and yet i really think that we would have to go back hundreds of 300 years before the enlightenment , in which we have to do progress , in which we have to do progress , in which we have about these things as well as now .
people are moving into their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth will free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right on its opinion .
but you know , what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have a right on your own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i have an article about immunization for &quot; the new yorker . &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at the resistance , on resistance , on resistance to what the most effective activity in the history of humanity is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a certain rather rather than a random form of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i made on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who didn &apos;t <unk> me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that brought me so confused ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as early .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking to ironic with little quotes with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what causes that .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , and sometimes there is no reason why that doesn &apos;t be so .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be rather skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand it .
don &apos;t take anything than granted .
but now comes out now : if you have to get evidence , you take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with each other , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in connection .
very scary .
plenty of studies were done to see if that was true .
plenty of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all right , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we think of anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see , what we think of what we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe at a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries on the world , in which the <unk> for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
now , i understand that . that i do .
because there anyone here ?
did one one in the audience ever see anyone at measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country at all , but 160,000 times on the world last year .
these are many deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can denial about it , and people like jenny , and people like jenny and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and illiteracy of platforms live around .
and that can make them because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , boom , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so very much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he just developed with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good , except of it that paul walk around and about vaccines , and says how much they are , and that people just should stop <unk> .
and this is actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul went in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell no arms of <unk> .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
so you take them on , keep the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we &apos;ve got in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
what about <unk> ? take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine has written me a few weeks ago , and i believe i believe i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she would not vaccinate her child against <unk> . on no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe , maybe there was somebody tomorrow in lagos , and flies just after los angeles , in the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of this <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because so the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . do not as if he doesn &apos;t .
we love it to spin in lying . we love that .
did you all have all their vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you on the leaps .
i know that they &apos;ve done that because half of the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data shows that all the time .
they make their urine . more than never never do .
that &apos;s okay , they &apos;d like to take 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not , we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> themselves that it can afford .
so we walk on before , and where are we running ?
we walk into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious deal , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions dollars for it .
and i have all sorts of props here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , they shout the people in and say , &quot; what does it care ? let &apos;s make people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go on this way , where believe and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 400,000 people around because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths deaths in a country that becomes worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in which we are now in , is that absurd , between the <unk> genetically <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she must stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every branch , every branch , every branch , each <unk> , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we &apos;ve done this everything .
we did it in the last 11,000 of 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re re-engineering food .
why do we do that ?
now what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix us that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company .
she &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
she &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes , and sometimes the idea that we should not allow the science to do , because we have a real dead , and she holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? re-engineering food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like they were cassava .
cassava is something that &apos;s a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all that right at it .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything that i can say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes <unk> . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , more food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far as far as we do so far , i believe , i don &apos;t want to be guilty of being <unk> colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to stop that .
after this incredibly funny conversation , you want to say , &quot; do you want to say , &quot; don &apos;t you want to go into this ridiculous machine and going into the future ? &quot;
on any case . that &apos;s what i want to do .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to <unk> , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and far as far as it is really what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
since some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician &apos;s interested in it , it &apos;s as , because , you look at it as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be real if someone is just stuck with it . &quot;
with other words , <unk> have been a measurable effect in some studies , the <unk> , which is a <unk> or a kind of ... in <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a <unk> or a kind of ...
a deception becomes something real , because somebody it changed .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magician .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i even have learned him from <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
so , look at what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife just in my hand .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve or out of him , i just will just <unk> my wrist .
in this way , you can see that doesn &apos;t move anything . as long as i <unk> here , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife will be held through my naked physical magnetism .
it actually sits in its place that i can shake it , without the knife fall .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> young children who are interested in magic , because you can find very much about deception , because you can look very much about deception , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you know here in the room this trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist , to make sure nothing in my sleeve or come out , and this is a lie .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist , is that that &apos;s the actual secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i put my hand from them , so they &apos;re looking at them from the back of the back of the back , and that &apos;s just where he was , in a position , in which he &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who is not a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> me , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why that is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there only is three fingers , you &apos;re not an individual , one , one , two fingers , one , two , three , but she looks as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not actually about here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it will be stuck there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is going to be moving through this movement that the finger is coming back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really got me really blown away me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and that &apos;s why that was an amazing thing .
so it turns out , if you offer a dummy placebo placebo against a white pill , in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s just one round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you get the shape , in which they give this placebo against placebo , for example , change into a smaller pill , and this blue and put a letter on it , they &apos;re actually measurable .
and that , although none of them <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill isn &apos;t so good like a blue pill .
what ? that really popped me out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not anything .
if you take capsules that are more effective than pills pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s at a end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
also the dose plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
that also , the <unk> play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected a patient .
that creates a very strong picture in your head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a dimension of projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our faith in us that &apos;s a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose something that is obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long . she &apos;s very , very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of a little bit sterile .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat meat .
this is my skin . this is no special one of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and push through them through the other side .
if you get nasty -- if you fall out , i showed that a couple of friends last night in the hotel room and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman who i didn &apos;t know .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to go quickly , you look for the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;ll be the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right now , you can also get <unk> if you want .
so , it goes so , right here , where my meat begins , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
really sorry . do you do this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , so again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> themselves the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show it to you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people behind saying , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the <unk> come in the <unk> now .
let me show you out of the closeness .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is no special one of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to be evil , look away , look away .
people back the back or the ones that look at the video at some time , will say , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it would be real impressive , he would say , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would be good , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me <unk> a little blood for you .
yes , here &apos;s it .
usually i would take the needle .
i would show my arm clean and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of making a real real thing , i &apos;ll just let the needle put in there and go so from the stage .
we &apos;re going to have a couple of times at the next days .
i hope you &apos;ve been excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people the number of books on the number of books that were published in the last five years , and they gave after about 40 on the last five years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s very much <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of this tide , there are multiple cognitive ones that are kind of not impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of these cognitive traps .
this is true for <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are as confused as anyone else .
the first one of this falling is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is just no useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could narrow it , but in the big and all the one is that we need to give up , and we &apos;ll take the complicated view of what is what well-being is .
the second trap is a false experience and memory : basically , they are between happy and happy about his lives or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that makes well-being without its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who had a story , &#91; unclear ... and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and in the end of the recording there was a <unk> sound .
and then he added , really pretty emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t know because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to retain .
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present knows , is able to experience the past again , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt , &quot; does it hurt when i put them here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that , the <unk> and the history of our life is going to be upright , and it &apos;s the one that gives you the question , &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units that <unk> itself and the <unk> self , and the two to confuse is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this starts really starts with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it begins immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me start <unk> with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that slipped a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . she &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had to have a patient .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a a much worse <unk> of the <unk> had <unk> as a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how she ends .
and no of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear worse than the others .
and the ones that is worse is the where the pain is completely at its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing about ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as for b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view b clearly b clearly had an inferior time .
now what you could do with patient a do , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , you actually could actually be the <unk> by patient a danger by just to shake up the tubing without loving him .
that will lead to the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that a few minutes , you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a <unk> on the patient , and you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a much better thing , because now you have patient a better story about his experience .
what draws a story out ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that provides memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
so , a story <unk> are turnarounds and end .
end is very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
now , the <unk> self lives continuously .
it turns out moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i have this thing -- you know , the psychological presence for about three seconds . what means , you know , the psychological presence for about three seconds . in a month there &apos;s about 600,000 million of that . most of them there are not leaving .
most of you will completely ignore by <unk> itself .
and yet , they kind of get the sense that they should count that what happens during that moments of <unk> is going to happen .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use as we &apos;re using on the world .
and as we use them , seemingly important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday and the second week just as well as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the <unk> vacation because there are no new memories of it .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that a <unk> itself different from a <unk> itself . time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually that that &apos;s that that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , and decides what he has to pick up , then , that he has to choose , then , the reason that he &apos;s supposed to choose less bad and that is the surgeon that &apos;s selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future for than <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of the <unk> itself as one , which is sort of the <unk> itself in the experience that the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need .
i have the sense that when we do vacation , that means that , that means we make holiday largely in the services of <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve made a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think relatively often about it , how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably have from my memories to this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now if i &apos;ve ever opened the &quot; folder with the 600 pictures that i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours and a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , how little appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to make memories so much weight in the <unk> to the weight that we give ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> all their paintings are crushed and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;ll remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , you get a answer . and if you think of the sense of memories , you might get another answer .
why we select the <unk> that we find is a problem that has a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask questions : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
which are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> itself over time .
if you ask after happiness &apos;s happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfied or pleased the person to think about your life .
very different term .
each one that these terms is not different from happiness , and i &apos;m part to a lot of researchers about well-being , and i &apos;m part to a lot of explorers about well-being that the exploration of happiness have messed up .
the distinction between happiness &apos;s happiness and the happiness of the <unk> itself is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization organization has a worldwide poll where more than a half a million people are asked about what you think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of ourselves .
and the main lesson that we think i believe is that they are really different .
you can know how content someone with his life is , and that doesn &apos;t tell you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an impression of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about its size ?
now , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s his life as eight on a scale of 10 of 10 of 10 times , they have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> itself .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what makes the happiness of <unk> .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly happy to be satisfied with people that we like , time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of ourselves , they will be doing very different things at the end .
the conclusion from what i said here is that we should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you think of this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate are not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to the end to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who are moving to california , happier .
now , your <unk> itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about how awful the weather in ohio was in ohio . and they will feel that they have the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , she told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup gallup survey .
is this something that you can leave ourselves because you have a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the <unk> itself .
if we looked at how emotions vary with the income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample under another income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting increasingly happy , the poorer you will become .
that &apos;s where we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i haven &apos;t seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is no <unk> , but that lack of money on money , and we can do this misery and we can measure this misery very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> itself , you get a different story .
the more money you are worthy of happiness .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , all the american commitment to life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in <unk> and so on .
is there an opportunity to be that politicians that the country generally would take a <unk> as the seriously , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , they just happens and in other countries you just happens .
people are doing that , recognizing that you should think of happiness when you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study <unk> or whether you want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to improve happiness , very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
that will influence politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic will be , or should at least the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;re going to develop now for 10 years . and my goal for the next decade is to make it just easy to make the world in reality as they &apos;re in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including you all , more time with playing play , more and <unk> games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you consider how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but actually , my research at the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite appropriately .
three billion hours a week aren &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most biggest problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time .
i calculated that the intervention required time at 21 billion hours a week .
this appears to be something more <unk> , so i repeat it , so i can deal with problems like hunger , poverty , climate change to solve global conflict and obesity , i believe we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes exactly why i believe that games are so vital for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of playing . so he has built a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you don &apos;t have a player , maybe give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but very good concentration , but very <unk> in the solve a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some nuances here , which is a sign of optimism . the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge of so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was ever possible .
it was almost near the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just a short victory ago .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces on the world , if we take the barriers of the next century . the face of the people who are going against all the <unk> on the verge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life i am bad , &quot; <unk> . and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am that &quot; in life i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis in my thesis that we are better than in life .
this is a problem that have many players .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , i &apos;m good at the context of motivation to do something more <unk> , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately , they &apos;re trying to solve the problem , as long as necessary , it would try to try it again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , when we poke on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel beaten . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed or <unk> .
these feelings we never have if we play games , in games , don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it possible in play , to think , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from playing reality ?
so i looked like world of warcraft on that that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the epic wins in <unk> as possible .
so first , first , if you get in one of this <unk> , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to get you a <unk> mission , and it immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission to fit perfectly at your current level , right ?
so do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to do . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn <unk> . there are always something important to do .
and there are plenty of employees .
where you &apos;re also going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who have to work with them to be their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in the true life , that sense , that at a <unk> of a <unk> of employees .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have driven by &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; and &quot; + 1 is &quot; or &quot; - 1 . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the true life .
if i &apos;m leaving this stage , i didn &apos;t go : + 1 : - 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m going to get in the true life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be so satisfying , anytime on the verge of a <unk> , that we would rather spend our whole time in this <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound <unk> .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go upright .
the first where the first living .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently spending playing with games , that just make sense , when you hold the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that we use this whole time to play that whole time , actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , cook creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . that i believe .
consider this interesting statistics , which recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country with intense <unk> spends 10,000 hours to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours in the united states , which they spend in school , from the fifth grade , by the degree of high school -- if you never missing .
so we have a complete <unk> , on the young human people , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of them have the new book inspired by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success &apos;s success for 10,000 hours .
she &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> that when we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of any subject to the 21st century , we will give up in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what also to do , as the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a total generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have never been there before there &apos;s human potential .
so many people have we currently have in the world who spend at least one hour per day with <unk> .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinarily well in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , with the <unk> , so in india , china , brazil to play brazil online .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think of what it is what it is to master us .
here are the four things i found . as first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do , immediately to do a hurdle , together with the faith that we have an urban hope .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth trying to try and go .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
there are a lot of interesting research that shows that we are people more than we played with them , even if they defeated us evil .
the reason is that there is a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that someone is spending time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and until the <unk> .
so this allows the <unk> to grow from bonds , trust and each other .
as a result of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier , working hard to work hard as if we can relax or do nothing .
we know that we work as much as human beings , if we do hard , significant work do .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it to become part of awe of awe of the brain .
here &apos;s a <unk> to turn that into the same light . you know all of wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information over world of warcraft on the internet than over any other theme in every other new the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as individuals .
and the only problem is that they believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to witnesses less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that that makes sense , because players can reach into <unk> more than in real life .
they can make stronger social bonds than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely no <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> gave it <unk> .
and these were sort of the first of people developed <unk> .
and when you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were games , more <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
supposedly , there was such a big famine that the king of <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
the people suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so very much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> surviving , she survived so 18 years of these famine , by she ate at a day and the next time .
as well , i think , let &apos;s put games today .
we put games to play the suffering of real world .
we sit out games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we bring ourselves what we need out of play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king decided to be a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the victor to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and made themselves looking for a new home . they just let a lot of people back to survival and looking at the rest of the way to survive , in which they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> that the <unk> , that later the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently came to the notion that <unk> &apos; crazy story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that took almost 20 years of what could explain the famine .
so this could be this crazy story .
maybe they actually saved your people by playing for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about those <unk> , and so much about these <unk> , they learned that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also do that .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 since 1994 .
that was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years .
i argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half their civilization on the search for a new world . so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be <unk> in it that half of us have spent an hour with playing games until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and exactly that question i &apos;ve got my work in the institute at the institute of the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it presses like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome . and then people make people to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re going to imagine epic wins and giving people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very short three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so we have enough <unk> , so they &apos;re going to be realistic , so they &apos;re going to be able to live your real life , and then you have to figure out how much oil is there , and then you have to figure out how much oil is being true , if it would be true . and we ask them to be true , and we ask them to make videos or photographs .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players . and we &apos;ve been accompanied them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventures and said , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go on .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have keeping that <unk> behavior .
so we have us for the next <unk> game a bigger , higher goal than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
starting to start the calculation of a <unk> that people only have 23 years on the planet left .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , of course .
the call to player , to sign , we have almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know , jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game eight weeks long .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on the third march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank the award &quot; social <unk> , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and funding them to learn , social gridlock .
we have a comic to that . we have &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all to invite you to share this game with young people , everywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , who are going to be able to imagine their own social company to save the world .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , believe , happens next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree to me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make close social nets , <unk> and the desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play significant games in order to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like that and play .
if i went into the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things that we can create any future imaginable , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what to write me a few months ago in the writing of a article for <unk> magazine .
i always have my <unk> right now , but i was working with the work of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been able to <unk> in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; , &quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so bruised , useless and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , stability . &quot;
i read this list out of a friend aloud and read , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t stop reading , but i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading after this <unk> <unk> and that with <unk> shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the issue has been quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started to build with elementary school , and so , to build my sense of self outside of my family sphere and to shape , also in terms of other kids and to the rest of the world around me .
and god was thanks very much at the time .
would i take this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me as a person who can be positive , their lives in any way . today , i &apos;m going to have to be positive and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and expected i find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
especially the last two words , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe to this words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and as we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the romans , have really believed that the pronunciation has a big force , because what you have is a big force , because what you can do loud .
so , what do we actually do <unk> -- one disabled people or a powerful people ?
alone , one people <unk> as a child might be enough , they &apos;re <unk> and ideas <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be fun to open the doors ?
a man who opened for me the doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name is , how you can think that most americans couldn &apos;t get correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just made for children as well as created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to be repeating the individual exercises of seemingly often with this thick , elastic <unk> -- that you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated them . i hated her . i hated her . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a <unk> child with dr. p. and so trying to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these practice were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll put one of those tape .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , a simple trick from dr. p. , so i wanted to make the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that i did not want to do with the way , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask myself today , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> man .
this is just one example of many of how adults can encourage the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the already <unk> examples of the <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow us our language to imagine something that we all want to do : it would be every single thing to see itself as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were triggered in many cases by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you can tell , of course , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> out of television and artificial <unk> for the borders that allow people to use to be able to use a own identity , which is to be able to use a own identity , people are providing a personal identity , people can allow them to be able to pick up a own identity , orient up to groups around the world that they pick themselves .
so , perhaps this technology shows this technological change clearly , because it has always been a different truth , which is that every human society can be something completely <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always feel like me , and i &apos;m always going to feel very uncomfortable , and i &apos;m always going to feel very uncomfortable to me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable with people , and i think gradually i understand why .
this sentence from the deal with <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , as if my life would be so successful , as if my life would be so successful , and as if my life would be so successful , or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re changing from the challenge , whether they physically , emotional or even more .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are no obstacle that we need to <unk> to get out with our lives better .
<unk> belong to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact or the hard of the <unk> of a human one .
there are in life <unk> and challenges , and these are just <unk> real and every person &apos;s real and every person &apos;s not , whether we come with <unk> or not , but how we come to that .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepared to be able to get good with it .
and we &apos;re not doing our children , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to be clear two things : to be the medical fact to be amputated and to the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent permanent disability , with which i had to put apart , is that the world is constantly saying , she could describe me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart of our heart , and even a forecast , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast to the quality of life that you expect , we need to pay attention to the way that someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the key concept that are just looking at what &apos;s broken in one , and how we repair that , for each individual disability than the pig &apos;s disease .
if we weren &apos;t holistically treating people holistically and not all its forces and possibilities and acknowledge , we create to the natural struggle that you may have to lead to , another disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look over the <unk> , and we have focused on all parts of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not have these <unk> times not <unk> or deny , we should not try to avoid them , but to avoid them under the rug , but it &apos;s about to see in the <unk> opportunity .
it may be more likely to be more about saying that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to embracing them , but that we &apos;re open to hug a <unk> , and maybe even dance .
and maybe we can create it , <unk> as something natural , <unk> and useful and feel so through their presence as well as their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . anniversary of charles darwin and when he wrote over 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in something very true in human character .
i would rearrange it so that is not the most powerful of its way , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the thing that can adapt to best .
of conflicts comes creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the fight of human mind is defined by conflict .
so , again , change and adjusting adaptation are the greatest qualities of people .
and maybe we just know what wood we are carved by , when we really get tested .
potentially , exactly that the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give up a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> stand for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i believe the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
even honest -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal one .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one . but not the normal . and would you really want to know these arms , gray person really want to know if it really would be ?
i think , rather , not .
it would be great if we could have this paradigm against another of normal against another of the possibilities or the strength to make it even a bit of a little dangerous to formulate , and they invite to make their own special and valuable skills in society .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always been able to have people from the members of our society .
there are evidence of evidence 60,000 years ago , the neanderthals had been carried older people around 60,000 years ago , and that happened , because the <unk> in the <unk> of this human people was valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable treatment .
a few years ago , i went in the city , in which i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summer and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you shouldn &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i brought her out from the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it made a click click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who knew just from stories about this day , because i knew of course , quite typical to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet came up to you , and i only had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , this strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never go , and never be as effective as other kids , or that you could never lead me an independent life , and then they just got me <unk> . &quot;
really extraordinary , i found that he gathered my whole childhood out of my whole childhood , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , whether i had the <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his favorite x factor , the potential of human will .
you just can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical that can be for the quality of a human life .
and dr. <unk> went on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get something else , if you don &apos;t get a little bit of support when you get children themselves , then children can achieve very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with that , two different things are .
and also i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of the time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 years , whether i &apos;d been asked my prostheses from flesh and bone , then i would have no second <unk> .
i didn &apos;t want to be normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experiences .
and maybe this change could happen also , because i &apos;ve seen so many people who opened up the doors , rather than people who have been able to hold me to me , or i wanted to take a notion of <unk> .
see , it takes really just one people that shows you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own , internal forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create that , and open up a long moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them up to open the doors .
the actual meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is in one , the potential <unk> .
again , what potential do we want to use ?
in the 1960s , one case was done one case . then <unk> were transformed into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student is going to be <unk> harder , get the better teachers on and so on .
they then put over a <unk> period of time with a &quot; independent &quot; is very good . it was told that they were very smart , they were very smart , and after these three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear that the <unk> was told that they were just enough .
and as well , it was then after three months .
but just those who were still in school -- except by the students who had thrown out the school .
very crucial at this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just told you that are the <unk> and that are the students with the grade , and so they teach them something and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> spirit of a mind that has broken up a mind that has broken no hope anymore . he finds nothing more <unk> , <unk> and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we create it , but creating the human mind , continue to help themselves and other people around themselves and other people to find out , curious and <unk> , we put our forces really positive one .
if a mind has to have these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and the poem knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , but the god , who knows only four words , but the god who knows , he always says , come to dance with me . &quot;
come on dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than they are currently ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more accurate and faster and faster .
or want to be <unk> , stronger , more force .
do you want to be attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always coming to more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
a few . probably about so many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the <unk> i like , as a doctor .
if you just could have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is this all just fantasy ?
or is it maybe possible ?
evolution is a <unk> topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay with the title &quot; nothing in biology does no sense of the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those are not taking the evidence for the biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the <unk> -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn &apos;s book , which is about being wrong because nothing in the other talk will make sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it only about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or matters too ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i have put a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , they &apos;ve had success ; it has shown its surroundings .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , there was maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years here .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the biggest part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite the same .
is you realize that we can pull out of it and the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human <unk> , which is used to treat a diabetic &apos;s protein ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about about bacteria , is you aware that each of us in our gut are more bacteria than it leads to cells in our body ?
maybe 10 times so much .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks , think about the bacteria , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutrients that they could only want to provide without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> , <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help with digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we defined something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to a step back in the time of the big bang -- the earth , the solar system , the solar system , perhaps about three to four billion years ago -- the first <unk> of creatures -- the first <unk> of creatures -- the first <unk> of creatures -- and then the human species , which is what is in the last <unk> years .
in this giant unfinished symphony of the universe , is the life on the earth just briefly , the animal kingdom , as a single length of sync , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
this also represents the <unk> of this speech , so i hope , d ace people had it .
now when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> .
i was intrigued by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in love of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue in both <unk> .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms came out , the things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and quite important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s the genome , the rest of the body will <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of our body in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it came to my increased doubt .
i came to this to understand the feelings of george burns , who <unk> his show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , is there a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
he says a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i will take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal of <unk> that i was a goal of <unk> as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to keep the body to keep the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health after a disease .
i wanted to lead to a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about protecting the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i &apos;ve developed as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next level of the orbit to go into the sea .
i think we would all bring out the mood , and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to achieve it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life to prefer .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily <unk> the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest one .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and by making the hot steam survive , if fish were there , there are vacuum vacuum there , they &apos;ve managed to make it a <unk> environment for themselves .
so , what means that , if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and how we think about the space in evolution , and especially as we &apos;re looking at <unk> in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of options .
the first is that we don &apos;t get moving forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reasons for that would be that it &apos;s been us by medicine , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and from the population .
and second , we as a species have our environment so <unk> that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , that they adapt to them , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and circulate and circulate us so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution of evolution to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional way , of course , imposed from the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are <unk> .
and so far that isolation is , if we colonize a species as a species , it becomes insulation and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new evolution that not just is , of course , but led from us as <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men as women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think , if it wouldn &apos;t only be the gender of your child to choose but also in the body of genetic adaptations that can heal disease and prevent .
what if you could make the genetic change to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or stroke ?
would you not want to do that changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , this kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , she could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion pairs of the human genome to a price of about 10,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long long until the reality is that it will give the 1,000 human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
in front of a week ago , gave the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to <unk> proteins -- which is <unk> arnold . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> was awarded the <unk> <unk> for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , and through the manipulation of just four genes -- a cell potentially in the position of your body .
these changes are in coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin into bacteria that can produce viruses that are not just protection before , but also the immunity to other viruses can serve .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
this is all today , and in the future will be much more possible .
then , imagine two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could be sperm and <unk> or <unk> or the <unk> , to make your children a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk , the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to buy healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to prevent <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> have it allowed them faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs in the rule potentially 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years , and maybe even on the next hundred years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , the more more friendly ?
or will we be selectively controlled different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we create a society shape and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
and most of all of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to need to make this decisions ?
in good like in evil , and before you think , these decisions will be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or one other , the <unk> is helping to stand up and go back and go .
we at berkeley at berkeley , this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that you put in the morning and that gives you extra strength and that will continue to increase their speed and help them to keep their balance for example .
this is actually the true one of human and machine .
but not just that -- that merging and link them up with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which carries about 100 pounds on his back , and it gives you the demand to carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some important complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds about <unk> terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to live deep to living , to drop and highly modified movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and raise my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re as far as to imagine our <unk> this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s now let our look at the wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , which was in the height of her life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it also goes to the aging population , whose number multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or about other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
let me introduce you to you now , which is carried by amanda <unk> , who was worn at the outcome of 19 years ago that she could not run more than 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as to their <unk> , which they move forward to this pretty much <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every movement and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after that , not long after that , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to have it since , to learn to drive back , and even driving with the hands of wheel .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all users , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of the <unk> of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> as <unk> a <unk> at a volunteer <unk> of the fire .
now , in our city , in our city , in the age of volunteers , you have to be quite early on the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at the <unk> , i had pretty good opportunities in that .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood down in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen outside in <unk> rain , while her house fell in flames .
the other volunteers that came out of me was going to come out of me -- call him <unk> luther -- reached the <unk> to go to the house and was asked to save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was lost out of envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , which now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was going into a <unk> house to save a creature , just because he was faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hope was to me , but i went to -- the stairs , the hallway goes down to the &quot; real &quot; <unk> by that point , at this point , at this point , at that point , was just as done to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our estimate out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his substantially more attention than mine .
some weeks later , the <unk> received a letter of the <unk> in which she was <unk> for the brave use of her house .
one about everything is kindness : somebody had brought her even a few shoes .
both in my profession as also in robin hood , as also in my <unk> , when i volunteer , i &apos;m looking at generosity and kindness in big scale , but i also see the power of altruism and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room in this room and see people who can either have a <unk> success or on your way , i want to offer this memory : wait .
wait not wait to make a difference in life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you give it now .
use them in a <unk> , rooms you put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save the lives of a man , but every day offers us the opportunity to change one .
so go ahead ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where the women lead to the <unk> , with sex &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the river of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of human evolution in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the prize .
during chimpanzees of large , fear <unk> fellows will run the <unk> of <unk> females .
they really have come up there , because this leads to a very <unk> society , in the deadly violence far .
but unfortunately bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the depths of <unk> <unk> , and are the observation only hard accessible .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of a violent argument -- the arena of a violent argument that has been used for decades and almost so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also is at risk of survival .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> lead to that you don &apos;t even put a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a smile to hear the trees .
who are these relative ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; <unk> , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos are made out of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love it to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s just essential to the attachment by connection and the care of tolerance .
that &apos;s what we learn and the rules of the game .
play increased creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you observe bonobos at stake , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight out of the wild .
first one <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think in <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin of saying , &quot; they grabs him at the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it like him , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both with bonobos as well .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , and also , as the play is the game of faith as well as also -- while it makes enormous fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> and it can take a lot of forms of which some more quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the intuitions again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re <unk> borders of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact . and the unexpected wiring that we form is the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a smaller <unk> on the insights , the bonobos in our past and present .
but she also true a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through bigger creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game of key to these skills is .
with other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play play .
but will we make the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s crucial .
for bonobos and people alike are equally made of teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play may be <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we play the creativity of <unk> and the wonder <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 , at the same moment , at exactly the same moment , every <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to do too much time , because if you think of the whole time the <unk> , you will not listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case the sperm <unk> , which hits the x <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying this x that meets the x chromosome .
both are <unk> , both of the fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my work , i &apos;ve got two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studying studied , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal body -- as they <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> , as they thought about body .
the other hat i carried in my work at my work is the activist , as <unk> -- or , as i say , as i say , when impatients , as i say , as impatients , the patients of physicians .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i just give you just a couple of examples of <unk> that &apos;s not the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> , which we &apos;ve all been growing up with testes .
and that &apos;s why the testes are giving the testes at the palm stage .
but because this individual has missing receptors , to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body has more of the typical female results .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it mostly takes until they reached puberty and grow their breasts and develop their breasts and develop them , but develop her period , to someone &apos;s coming up to a little bit different .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that they are rather than <unk> and uterus , in fact , in fact , in fact , they have a y system .
this is important to understand that you could actually hold this person for actually , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that you &apos;re called <unk> .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> that are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t think that i probably have the typical <unk> -- most women as i actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually have a brain that was that more <unk> exposed to the testes , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of an 19 years ago , who was born as boy , who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had just found that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in utero , his <unk> was so strong that they created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> became male male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody saw something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually of it , because he was inside <unk> that the doctors found that he was inside the female female .
okay , just a quick example for a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something that is called <unk> , with <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason , why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> twins , is it <unk> -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health of advantage of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomic level goes with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is going to be a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be supposed to be an black identity , means to have an african anatomy .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re confronted with a body that is actually something very different , which is very different in terms of this <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen in the last time , the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender at the <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in berlin .
many journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what test you will do that tells us if <unk> <unk> female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there doesn &apos;t have this test .
we know now that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that the nature for us is not going to admit that nature is not going to be moving between male and female and <unk> and <unk> ; we are it that that is what this line is as naturally .
so we &apos;ve got such a situation where , where the further our science progresses , we have to mean more , that these categories that we &apos;ve kept for resilient categories , which are very simple <unk> .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it also &apos;s true of race , which turns out as much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
at our observation , we came into all sorts of <unk> areas .
we invite to for example on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to start with the fact that we only differ by a few <unk> ?
while we continue to move our science forward , we get increasingly in a zone of <unk> , where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories we &apos;ve probably had too simplistic .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas , in which we see this to the <unk> , in our current culture , in our current states , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what point is a body to human beings , so that he &apos;s a different thing as fetal life .
we &apos;ve been very difficult today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors used to have never been so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they just held a spring under the nose , and when she moved into it , she didn &apos;t bury them .
if they didn &apos;t move more , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today , where we take people <unk> organs and take them to others .
and as a result , we caught us at the fight with the really difficult question , when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have more categories as used .
now , you might assume that the whole crash didn &apos;t make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to grasp that these categories are really much insecure than we thought , makes me tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking the democracy .
so to tell you from this <unk> , i have to do first accept a big fan of fathers .
i know that they were <unk> , i know that they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which what they were doing , and it &apos;s not because of the music , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> is happening with the <unk> .
the fathers were from my view of my view , and that &apos;s why that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radically , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember our fathers were the concept of the monarchy the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was taken on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had the political power had to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to father to son and so on .
the fathers meadows this idea back and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created .
they <unk> the field of play and decided that <unk> , the common things it cared , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did that part , because they were part of a <unk> system , in the two things together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , clearly , many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations <unk> way , and meadows things , like an supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that managed to get us a concept that was a concept that was a concept of <unk> .
and with that , they have really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened to this ?
for example , used to use women who are the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the fathers that says , which says anatomic beings are important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we should not have a uterus and <unk> , that we should not have to have the <unk> , etc . , that &apos;s fairly ownership , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> that successful .
next , the successful civil rights civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different color , which are bound on anatomical differences , again , again , successful .
we see the same at the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we have to start to ask in question why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , you mind , i want to sustain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish for example as a human rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to sex with sex or to get married .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that make sense for me , and that we do , i think , always should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it are and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures who have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 at exactly the same day .
imagine that one of them , maria , three months <unk> , she was born on the one june of 1980 .
henry , on the other side , on the other side , is born to <unk> , so he &apos;s born by the one march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria three months <unk> , they get all kinds of rights three months before henry -- the fairly <unk> sex to have the right to choose the right to choose the right .
henry needs to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find another <unk> about what their rights are .
henry , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s going to be male , because you assume that he &apos;s male , he can now be moved in , which maria doesn &apos;t worry about .
maria for the other states , not in all states can &apos;t perceive the same right , the henry in all states , and to marry the right .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make this progress in the realm of anatomy , that we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels like the science , as if the science does .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere a line , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas has decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y y system .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of history that i told you at the beginning of the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream talk .
he says we should not be people to &quot; your skin , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are you judged people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people so , because i should admit that i know that i know a series of golden <unk> , which is probably benefits than some people i know .
i want to be <unk> that i probably <unk> some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent , more intelligent people than some <unk> that i know .
so how should we <unk> the question after the properties of character ?
it turns out as really difficult .
and one part of me wonder , what if the content is a personality something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an fmri project ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make themselves thoughts about questions of democracy .
in our efforts around democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it is in iran in the case , where a man who feels in iran , which is being punished to other men , it &apos;s been punished by death , it &apos;s ready to match a <unk> , in which case he may remain alive .
states of that kind of existing in us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon with which i talked about a few years ago , which had a few <unk> twins , which had a few <unk> twins , in order to make them a name .
but when i <unk> with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was his answer -- it was his answer to that , that kids would be very badly treated , and therefore he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , did they consider political asylum , rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without changing the state .
that &apos;s why i think we must be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve been talking very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy might look like , or looked at the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and that &apos;s what i think there might be different types of insights that are produced by different types of anatomy , <unk> when people use a <unk> .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also interested in research in the area of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways how they think and in the world act .
what we &apos;ve experienced from <unk> studies is that women , in average , but on average -- not any , but on average , more complex relationships and care for people who are vulnerable to people , very much attention .
and therefore , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation before .
years ago when i did a graduate student , i asked me one of my <unk> , which was my interest in feminism -- i watched as a feminist , so it still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what on feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , he &apos;s going to resolve it about gender about gender , that &apos;s why the feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought it could be something <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s supposed to be called it , it could give you something , in average , which makes female brains from male social relationships of <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so , where the founding fathers were very <unk> were protected as individuals before the state , it &apos;s possible that when we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we can &apos;t just be able to protect how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we need democracy to think about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think of identity and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> and this here is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , to every opportunity to try to find a different <unk> , crazy outfit , to take pictures and photographed in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment and also that in my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for serving my dollars for usually , i see quite unique , and it &apos;s shopping to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it be my height ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody get with so many <unk> with ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very precisely what i brought .
i brought seven <unk> , and that &apos;s everything .
<unk> for exactly a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i have bet that i &apos;d like to wear all other things i might carry , if i only wanted to get to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t heard of me as the woman who here at ted in their underwear , which means that , i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i really want to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you believe it or not , from this <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has got me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you carry <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time of my life with trying to be able to be myself , and adapt at the same time .
be just who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they don &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;re going to value it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , as if i dress up , or that i remember their seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you look at something good , then it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good at something , you probably are right right now .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize the short for them .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , then there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : <unk> <unk> in everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one thing without telling a word .
it was always been proved to me and again , when people came up to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all over .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to be emotional <unk> , because right around the corner , it &apos;s always going to be a different <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me when i have a little bit in the heart and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy , and every boy in italy , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this thing in the formula one in the world past decades .
some time ago , it was so that if she wanted to win a formula one race , then they took their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , then she won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , like this one -- something like this -- something that has been monitoring the car in real time , some thousand sensors on the system , and then they &apos;re going to use this , and that then use this car to send it back to this car , and they &apos;re collected things in real time .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consists of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what today is interesting today is the <unk> begins in our lives .
our cities were going to be in the last few years , just equipped with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to get to computers in free .
and as computers in free , you start to respond to other ways , they &apos;re seen and powered and powered .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the land , but 50 percent of the world population there are life there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , it pulls all this sense and forces in objects of everyday life .
this is from one exhibition , the paola antonelli : for moma later , as the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; play with me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us back .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this changes radically the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo was being the moses shaped , it means that he took the moses and he was actually going to look at moses , and he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why aren &apos;t you talking ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to go to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the vision .
now the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is in truth one of the first of our labs .
it was formed four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done there was actually a time to use a new kind of network that was used on the world -- this is a <unk> -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> information from this network that are going to be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy was won the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in italy , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won the end .
now look at what happened at this day , only when the activity is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , before play .
you see the top of the time .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and move .
the game begins in -- silence .
france does a gate . italy make a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call , go on toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal play .
first phosphorus , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went into the center to celebrate .
she saw the big rash .
the next day , went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the space , <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the rash of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t have it a few years ago .
even very quickly , another example for feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
now , nowadays , we know everything about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the potato chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know little about where the things go .
so we actually designed some little markers to pursue the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we started to tag something more than a year ago , the things that they have <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would see just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage on the garbage and started to pursue it .
here are the results that we just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can actually make the same things in fact .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day that the cup that we throw away , not simply that she is still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away there &apos;s still there .
and if we would show that the people , then we can move a behavior forward .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague on the mit , <unk> <unk> , could take you much more about that , and the lot of other wonderful things that you can do with , but i want to talk to the second part of the world that we can do with the second part , which is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did in <unk> , in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> , which came to us and said that spain and <unk> a beautiful tradition , to use water as part of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a <unk> <unk> , i &apos;ve been asking these tubes in front of these tubes , and valves , <unk> , work that open up and close .
they cause as a <unk> with <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall off , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach him , and he will open up to make them <unk> as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it made him very much .
and we got the mission a building to design the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach him , it will open up and put them in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy when you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to know , like in this case , you know , these days , if you get the roof of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , you don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just so that the architecture almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that open the water that open water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a even greater fun in this night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that keeps still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
but reality is always unexpected .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s now a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> out of water and the projections .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have small helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you &apos;ve seen earlier , which moves with other , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently but infrequently , which is what changes , the light is changing , not the position of the <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then this could just be a 3d cloud of <unk> , on which you can walk up and move through which they can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to shape like a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people is run .
it could have every single individual <unk> , which comes from people , from the movements of people or so forth .
i want to show you something to first .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements into 3d to use them as momentum for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the various <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that they can feel the whole movement .
they can do that all the time .
but then , if we &apos;re all <unk> , you can play with that and with color and <unk> play .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics for the olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re talking about people with something to do something and change the environment -- almost like something like we call it to be a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a small donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing of what happened last years , the last decades is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible to the internet .
today , we can see for the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- can we move from the digital world from the world to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this means something called something in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the next challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually actually engage the people with them , in which they &apos;re collectively doing things together .
the cloud is again a cloud from <unk> , in the same way as a real cloud of particles is out of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical shapes in london , but with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different types of experiences .
you can actually look at it from bottom of the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and again , and it &apos;s as kind of the connection to community .
so both of the cloud cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like london new <unk> .
you can get in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , my context is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated by nature and that everything is connected .
the first time , i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first <unk> .
myself , awe awe .
my heart came out , i was <unk> , while i tried to believe what was in front of me .
that <unk> around me <unk> around 60 feet out of the water . and i could just wonder that that was a snowflake on a different snowflake year .
<unk> is born as calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in explicit ways with their surroundings and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and embrace until the bitter end , while others are not able to withstand it and more passionate passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , quite as we see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
during a iceberg melt , i put his <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg melt down , he puts <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i go to my footage of this dress so before , as would i make portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious moments , that they exist in these individual moments , and never come again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of your life cycle .
one part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;re <unk> is very young -- some thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i put in <unk> in greenland .
very rare you will actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where he &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
he sticking about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , shows you the iceberg of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , went to this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the als .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and pay attention .
we decided that , tony -- <unk> -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk again with tony .
i just want to go again with him and i said , &quot; moment , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard to higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did someone have seen the film &apos; butterfly and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- so your fingers walk along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just just a check , and instead i put a check out of that i didn &apos;t the slightest idea of how i should <unk> him .
i committed to place in space and to his father , and his father -- with the words , with the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is like , and we will find a way that he can make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who carries all that in itself , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i talked about some months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows you to put a light on any surface and then draw with a <unk> , which is only registered the negative area .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
they say all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the <unk> coming , after the <unk> and last doing people actually do art .
but there were always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and ate her from my wife and told her all of everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology to control things , so that <unk> can control a laser , so that he can make a laser , that would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a lot of organization later , after a lot of organization and forth , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we &apos;ve got the insurance industry out of the doors , and have actually received for <unk> a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really very funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from the world <unk> -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i went into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that and that we were <unk> and all images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks we have programmed , we went to <unk> in venice , my kids were involved in my dog , and we created this here .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , have them <unk> , they have <unk> , and now we have a device that is free , and now we have a device that is free -- you can build it ourselves , we can put the code for free , the software you can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free by limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
also no hospital .
every paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and this is his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> before the great unveiling before the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew tony for the first time over seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks over his life support system .
we have his bed somewhere that he can see after outside .
we &apos;ve set up a projector against a wall of the <unk> of the hospital .
and he went back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot .
<unk> , we had to <unk> in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he took us an email with the following information : &quot; for the first time , i have drawn something .
i feel that feeling , i was pushed underwater , and finally , someone stepped up and my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t this overwhelming ?
this is so something like our <unk> .
that holds us at the shelf and lets us develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes to a <unk> .
and someone who has a <unk> potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re doing that , to figure out how to get it better , faster and stronger .
since this time we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
think of it , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it comes all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored , when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it was this april , in the middle of the city of los angeles one exhibition is an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there may be quite the hardest representative of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , that computer , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just put something around and surrounded me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should each of you , and in every single day where you have something that needs to be done . if not , when not , when not , when not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably america &apos;s most <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell the people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you from circles and revelations .
now , a epiphany is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and takes it as a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the time in the &apos; 60s at <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who had a week in the <unk> green and blue beaten up until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they did secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco -- i found a lover -- and at the time in the 1980s , i found it in <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to know as adults .
please come to ohio , and please come together with the man , which i know that she has found him now .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and that i want you to open up . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we took them to her , and we gave up to her family , because it was necessary because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , i had to know , she turned into a box full of ashes and was placed into my hands .
what happened was that the circle closed , it was closed a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned .
he takes just as -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while they &apos;re on to 1,000 feet up .
imagine an airplane full smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear <unk> .
now , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> .
so i saw them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine already had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches off the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror to end .
i want to tell you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people that i wanted to get a hand , and i didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do is all the experiences i wanted to do and never made it .
while i was thinking about it , i noticed , a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is as far as the person is there , then i open him .
i never want to move more something in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was , when we had the george washington bridge , so quite around <unk> -- i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better in everything i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego room .
and i <unk> the time that i wasted things for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t give me two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and in the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of how you know it from a documentary .
while we stopped , i had this feeling , i had this feeling , human , not terrifying .
almost so , as we would prepare our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness <unk> really in one thought , which is that i just wish me one thing .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a presentation of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
not yet .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i realized at that time , by connecting the dots with each other , that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i became the miracles to die on this day .
i got another gift , which is to see into the future , and come back and different to life .
my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine that happens on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would they change ?
what would they do that they take off , because they think they were forever there ?
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
if it &apos;s going to be able to get the systems to <unk> the systems that can control and valves , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we create it that an effective <unk> on a laptop <unk> , which is used by a laptop , which is used by a <unk> box , then we are in business .
and this is the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are going to go into the gray box , damage the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> logged -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started to <unk> our research at six months ago was completely unknown , which was the sense of meaning and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the <unk> part of part , the <unk> part , he made by myriad <unk> failures .
and it seemed something <unk> , with these gray boxes , that <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> our attention and we started a <unk> project where we got our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> as a <unk> , which of our cheese didn &apos;t like -- <unk> off , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve experimented with different types of cheese , i went on that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , when a special configuration was detected . even if the special program that is trying to infect it on this goal .
and if not , don &apos;t <unk> nothing .
so that was really my interest and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , let &apos;s say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we <unk> the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
probably , they knew even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you already heard that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for as first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this cause .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
to get these theories , we call us in memory that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act around a <unk> goal and very likely it is in iran , because there &apos;s most of the infections were reported .
now , in this area there is not several thousand goals .
basically , it runs beyond the <unk> nuclear power and on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise with what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is that , this is this moving part within centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re actually able to crack down the rotor of rotor , and eventually , to make the centrifuge explode .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack actually was to make it slow and scary -- obviously , to make <unk> despair , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get out to get out to come up quickly .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of which we were looking very precisely data and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> is very clear out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
i started with scientific literature , like this <unk> in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became even better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 cells .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and often we ran into a dead end and had to gather ourselves up .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slowed out the big <unk> with six <unk> into interaction and manipulating valves .
so , in large and all we &apos;re very confident that we actually have defined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- got me out of my socks .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the gray box , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing does is that it makes the fuel values of sensors -- so for example , of <unk> and <unk> -- and it turns out <unk> code , which is still during the attack , which is running on with the wrong layer .
and actually , this false fuel data has been taken by <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where during the <unk> the <unk> is fed with before <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just that <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more valuable .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there where one human <unk> can &apos;t respond quickly enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big <unk> is going to fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by one human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk is at risk , really bad things happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither <unk> , nor the <unk> will notice it .
that &apos;s frightening .
but it becomes even worse .
and that what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do specifically with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we saw it at <unk> .
you also could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask us .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they lie in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most sensitive environments .
we have to ask us the consequences and we start getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of this that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind that .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would even bigger .
thank you that you have a <unk> <unk> . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to put me in situations that usually are very difficult and simultaneously dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat nothing like this -- fun at beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
actually , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career today to <unk> situations , and that all are a compelling thing that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way , and hopefully on a way to understand what they do for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i put an ad ago an ad on ebay .
i would send a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , received the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson is not going to be a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence to buy , and not a lot of evidence of what the subject would actually be .
so what you got , was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the topic is going to be , and they finally have to fly to the ears , especially when i could fly her company for their involvement .
but again , besides , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this now , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work in , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could be ready , nothing could be able to prepare for anything so hard and so dangerous as with these guys into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film around <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from up to the end , from the end to the end , completely with brands , completely with brands , which you &apos;re going to see in the film , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for always ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more toward the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as <unk> , but we &apos;ll be sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that you &apos;re at the risk of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , except to show that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring them the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to do if <unk> would help happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i &apos;ve heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it on any case , some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we may see like a tribe of <unk> .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at the people that they have to do it ...
there are some places we can apply to us .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera from &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant in reality , &quot; we want to do with your film . &quot;
and just so simply disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible to present it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and ancient media and the <unk> media and the <unk> media -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> that the masses brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem at all .
that would be okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is is a problem .
see , if you put transparency at the <unk> , that &apos;s one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- unencumbered by deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; it &apos;s easy to discover and the access to information , especially , which is <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes out that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear , who still <unk> .
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
what else else ?
a whole dish cool <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell you this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father was caught my father in lying -- and there he &apos;s sitting and watching me , &quot; my son , there &apos;s in every story three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s just a company , one agency was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i had to do it alone , i had to do it alone , i had to deal the <unk> and directly with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand becomes understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , giant <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> as i do .
and my friends who make big , giant <unk> , say that the reason their movies are so successful , at the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends who make little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> competing ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see in the film ?
whenever i do myself on the way , and always when i open the <unk> , they will see ban away .
and every time i <unk> someone , i can say , &quot; are they fresh enough for this interview ?
are you going to do ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they will have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well for women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you an emergent frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , doing these things -- you know , people remembers ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
with which words would they describe ban ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about audacious , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really to something positive , in contrast , &quot; fight and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like i , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to be beautiful clothes .
80s <unk> hits <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style of style that i have , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many <unk> and so a stuff .
but normally i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or one jewelry .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
one woman 2 : part hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in the entire country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be able to be the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a expert expert .
i needed someone who could come into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to discover this <unk> .
if you could do it for that , they could help me also help me .
you brought their images , yes ?
that i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and emotions about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the own world is the world , in which you live -- like people around one , the family , the way , the way you live life , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what connection is that to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s so , as i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what does they bring us ?
what is the <unk> ? where <unk> are you now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you that are not them .
which other <unk> have you through ?
that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . in what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yes . now . well .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be out of it .
there went quite a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
the add very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost an oxymoron .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , instead of both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , and they &apos;re actually going to avoid fear , and they actually turn them into something positive , and this is a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands act so ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii small of mini <unk> and <unk> .
now there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would they be ?
they get them a <unk> ? are you something that gets blood into <unk> ?
or are they more more a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are things that are kind of playful , fresh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , profane , <unk> , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> ,
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and the &quot; no &quot; said because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but will find 17 <unk> that were willing to prevent out on these control to prevent someone with someone who wanted to do with someone that would not have to tell stories -- stories that we don &apos;t usually have to tell -- stories that would never support a <unk> .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , so as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re used to <unk> the <unk> of the brain , both in order to make films as well as films .
we drove to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city for five years , has no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we drove in school , in which companies are going to form their way into impoverished schools , in all america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects of which i got the most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i had to interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is to think that our vision challenges .
and how was that for you ? what it successfully do ?
now , there &apos;s the film at <unk> film festival , we can look at this .
according to <unk> , the debut in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually just a period of two and two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be declining .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at which almost any <unk> , with which we talked to their clients , the finger of it .
something that i believe is , is that when you try to arrest your chance , taking risks that in these risk possibilities .
i think when you get people from it , then you bring them closer to the failure .
i think that if you train its employees to avoid risks , you prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel the feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
call the fear of fear . call the risk .
a whole large spoon full , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , bringing us a little honesty .
and this said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; is &quot; my entire talk , &quot; was written by my good friends from <unk> , the $ <unk> for ebay .
big data will be turned for organizations throughout the world .
<unk> shows , &quot; call transparency . &quot;
thank you very much .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happening with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , displayed on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude , to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> that is today , there were me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy with this slide and access to their access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t <unk> me -- but i had no access to many museums and this works not access .
when i traveled to , and visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried this desire -- art accessible to making technology together .
we put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look at all of these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i actually come into one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of kind of new york .
you come to two ways in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and sorry .
they want to orient in the museum ?
open the card , and jump you with a click .
in there they are , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just further . much fun .
look around .
thank you , but the best is coming .
so now i am before one of my <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
this is now one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who really care about art is , can click -- but i click that now .
this is one of the images that we captured with the so-called <unk> .
this picture for example has about 10 billion <unk> , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then they want really deep inside .
and so i started playing around to play , and found that there is something that goes .
and i thought , &quot; wait time , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit of a little known at the met with some known at the met , and found out that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , where a goose is beaten with a stick .
it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go really close to go , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview of the point , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one comes in -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
at the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what only when you want to see , like van gogh this masterpiece , because made this masterpiece ?
you <unk> in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my <unk> this picture until i really am at the fireman .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s still many other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , he &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- right or poor if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and online their own museum -- from all these pictures , you can get your own collection of collection .
just simple , you go in -- and i created this , it means the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> , in the <unk> .
they can put everything with comments , your friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when they look at this masterpieces .
i think finally , after me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they think not even from museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;ll be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent beautifully online .
that &apos;s the biggest question that &apos;s recently asked me , &quot; have you made that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
that &apos;s the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of any hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this guy would be completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you move your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been at one of these extreme decided , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain is about this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or whatnot .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , collectively with most other experimental logic , which need a good amount of logic to put together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play with it and look like it &apos;s happening . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years , is probably that one thing at the same time can be at a place .
i mean , it can think odd sound about it , that one thing at the same time is at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember a child playing on play on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good at it and he fell constantly .
but i bet it taught him play with the <unk> a very valuable lesson , which is the big things not just leave you over , and that they stay on a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re no <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , imagine all sorts of strange strange things -- as they can fly straight through walls , or that they can be at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations on , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t needed them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and that maybe because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever seen a particle .
but my logical side of this didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all things are made out of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that wasn &apos;t supposed to be so .
so i would make excuses better with the whole thing , if we could show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made myself a few years ago , exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we look at here is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
here i expand it something . we look right here in here .
and here &apos;s a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it is like a springboard and it stands over the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours to all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the capacity in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go to the other people , but i hear on all these things , because i don &apos;t want to offend them , or , frankly , frankly , they <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just feeling as well .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to be on them and the wind that seems over to them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see this piece of metal , we had to <unk> out the whole <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we made the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> it up to a vacuum and <unk> it up to almost , in the elevator , was the piece of metal free to behave like it .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead , that it just lies there , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> like this -- like a <unk> and together <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate to vibrate at the same time and not to vibrate -- something which allows just in quantum mechanics .
so what i just just tell you is what really amazing .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms is going to be silent there , and at the same time , the same atoms move down and down .
just to precise <unk> , she agrees .
the rest of the time they are <unk> .
that means that each atom is at the same time at two different places , which is what the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was worth it for all this year in the clean space , because , check this , the <unk> between one atom and this piece is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if a single atom to be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you do ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine , you &apos;d be at the same time at several places , how would that feel like that ?
how would your consciousness deal with it that your body is in space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact just <unk> objects that are in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s another bit more behind , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and strange of the mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where families are thinking about where they live and work , you want to pick you the opportunity between at least a hand of different cities that all in competition is all in competition .
in the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city to be available that she would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more valuable than it costs them .
so we could so easily with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities <unk> .
that sounds like absurd for you , if you never thought about new cities .
they just trade the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in homes , this already did . the other half yet .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;d like to be about to , in these homes and their environment , and their environment , to avoid complaints and from <unk> .
so it turns out as very difficult to keep out of all this extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new block , provided the laws there would support such a construction and not <unk> .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new surfaces that can provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , over 75,000 times their country , and they wanted to know what they could do , and they wanted to know what they could do in your country and do exactly the same in honduras in honduras .
at this point , <unk> has said to <unk> , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , and if we just want to go out of the canadian surface of our country , and if the people are going to work there , and if the people are going to work there , and can go on the surface of these messages , what they normally would usually go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer , south of 2009 , under a severe <unk> .
at the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program both innovation , as well as <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to become <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared me to a talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , try and try and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city on which is essentially reducing elements .
the first point , is the importance of law , laws that determine that you cannot realize existing <unk> .
we give new technologies big attention , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws . and it &apos;s usually for laws that are back to us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala <unk> <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him <unk> .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give that the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december <unk> in december <unk> in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are about how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a place when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk introduced in very simple shape that a <unk> city is a place that is a place that is going to be there , which is the laws that exist there and people have the ability to decide , either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we have to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country anywhere .
i was asked to come to <unk> and even once on the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve been given another with facts that has been a graphic like this has been a graphic like this , which has been trying to make a lot of value in a city , it needs to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in <unk> .
that airport alone has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area from least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
well , polite all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the director of congress came on the stage and has said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but could we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the statement that a new city offers new options .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also closes new ways for leaders with one .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could support from their <unk> to this charter and in the implementation that everybody can trust that the charter is really caught on .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the certainty of the <unk> was going to come here and build this city for all the parties in honduras , in honduras , who have been under fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s effortless , a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , at the 19th january of january , they voted on congress to have a <unk> policy that &apos;s for special <unk> <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a heavy crisis behind itself , has been elected to a voice for this <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it must be approved twice by congress .
at february 17th , it was been approved to <unk> <unk> to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , traveled from about 30 <unk> of the world that most of the world was most interested in the business of <unk> .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new core , which in south korea built hot big than the core <unk> .
everything you can see on this picture , was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very much interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we stand today .
they already have a <unk> ; and you already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that <unk> allows , and it &apos;s also working on an external law .
a country has already offered his supreme court to put up as a dish for the <unk> appeal of <unk> .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been understood , there are many <unk> .
there are many companies that would like to put in america , especially at a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
on the whole world there are 700 million people who claim that they &apos;d like to live on a different place .
one million people leave a year latin america and wander into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to be forced to <unk> their families to <unk> their work , sometimes there are single mothers who need to deserve enough money and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes kids are trying to find their parents , which they have , in some cases , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen more .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in honduras to build a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to pass on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new people ?
that &apos;s an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thanks ted .
do you know how many decisions they do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions they meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently made a poll with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions , the <unk> is a typical americans on a day is <unk> .
also , recently a study was made with ceos in which she saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the various subjects , and how much time they spent the ceo , and how much time they relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is busy in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these subjects , of course , insisted , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were going to be within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions required an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you do in the nine minutes of meet in the one hour category ?
how good , think are they doing that ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , there &apos;s just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very very very very very <unk> convenience stores , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of things of fruit and vegetables and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time as we actually drink <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business ; but at one point i &apos;ve asked me , well , how does it be that you never <unk> something ?
here is the olive oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years .
so i decided to visit the leader one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model , that you really offer people all these options ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came every day and typically their cameras had had on .
we decided to build an experiment and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gear .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we &apos;ve created a little <unk> directly at the entrance at the entrance .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes <unk> or 24 different tastes <unk> , and we &apos;ve got two things , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would be able to stay standing and <unk> ?
there are more people standing there when it were 24 , about 60 percent , when if it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what the people would buy a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who stayed when it were 24 percent , they &apos;d actually bought a glass of <unk> .
from the people who stayed when it were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do it , people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to the age .
now , if you don &apos;t choose a glass ticket is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> also affects us at very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when it comes against our own interests .
so the theme of the day , financial save .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we conducted the decisions for almost a million americans who were looked at about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was was whether the number of <unk> that were a <unk> , which were a <unk> , the probability plan , the probability of being saved whether more for tomorrow .
and we found out that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered anything between two to 59 with two to 59 .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , in fact , the participation was lower .
if you &apos;re now going to look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , had a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want to .
in the plans that have offered nearly 60 fund , the <unk> now fell on about the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you participate in <unk> , when more options were up to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so <unk> the people who chose to participate , rather than the more opportunities you were available , the more avoiding it and fund fund .
the more opportunities you were available , the more they put their whole money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend when you think your future resources is important .
now , in the past 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three crucial consequences to people who provide that for more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push on , even if it &apos;s against their own interest .
they meet more inferior decisions -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they decide to do more for things that you &apos;re less content , even if you make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelving of <unk> , mustard , and <unk> , but we actually couldn &apos;t go to compare the comparison and limiting , and then actually something out of the amazing offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in different ways -- which they &apos;re just tested in their business .
the first thing : narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that fewer more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry that they lose <unk> .
but in truth , we see it always more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to narrow , and the <unk> <unk> are reduced , now there &apos;s an increase in sales , it &apos;s reduced to the cost , &amp; amp ; and there is a improvement .
as a <unk> and gamble of the various head and gamble of the different head of 26 on 15 , she experienced an increase of sales .
when the golden corporation corporation her 10 of the worst sold , she experienced that the revenues around 87 percent <unk> -- a result of the two , the increase of two , and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is today <unk> supermarket of the world is <unk> , and they provide them just 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of the <unk> , i believe one of the best examples , which came to the market , about how to <unk> the choices , something that david <unk> has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s being offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff takes automatically under a <unk> part .
the ones that really want to meet a choice is saved 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i want to close it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your staff can &apos;t <unk> them , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to give all people in this audience to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple seconds to read , and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody who is willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more of this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that they &apos;re objective to the first time , when the second time , when the second time , but i would be able to do it , that she felt it at the second time .
because the images had made it real for them .
what &apos;s me going to bring me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that that people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that has to feel that these consequences are vivid and concrete .
why are people giving average 15 to 30 percent more , if you use a <unk> or a credit card than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not what we really feel money .
and it turns out that if you create it that something feels specific , it feels a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so we have in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people of <unk> -- and these people were all working with <unk> -- and these people were all in a meeting in which they signed their participation for their <unk> .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting exactly as she was always , only we &apos;ve added one little extra .
the small thing that we &apos;ve got to <unk> was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives , if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase of participation around 20 percent , and there was an increase of the number of people who were willing to save or an increase in the number of people who were willing to pay for the <unk> .
the third technique : <unk> .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we made in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different types of magazines up to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and put them into 10 categories or i put them into 10 categories , and then you believe that i have more choices and a better <unk> , when i had given them the 400 other , when i would have given them the 400 to you .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> and the display on right , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the on the left of jazz , and that , on the right is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and who &apos;s on the right is <unk> , but know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to tell the <unk> something , not which provides the choice .
and this problem you often see when you look at the long list of all of this fund .
who do you actually get informed by that ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> her car completely himself .
they have to create 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four opportunities .
what i do now is , i change the order in the decisions .
half of the customers is going to go from the many ways , 56 <unk> <unk> to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interests you .
if you all use the <unk> at the decision , that means that they &apos;ll be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the low <unk> and over again , the <unk> are choosing .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then stay with it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the sequence to change in that information .
if i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning like i <unk> .
even though the gears choose to give me nothing about my taste in the interior of the interior , it makes me still choose to choose .
it &apos;s also put me in excited about the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in this .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve been telling you about four techniques that the problem of the <unk> temper -- narrow -- make it real alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real alternatives , <unk> -- make it better with more categories , less options .
each of these techniques that i &apos;ll describe to you today is to help them to manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for themselves , good for the people that they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re at the choice of choice .
and the more we &apos;re more , we &apos;re more selective , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then , why this is what &apos;s important .
we all want to be the stars -- celebrities , comedians -- comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us that we all or all our creative activities can be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but at youtube , more than to youtube , more than 48 hours per minute .
again , just a tiny fraction of this is ever <unk> and will be looked at thousands of times and so to the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> of this video that he filmed in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like it looked like the video last summer to the first time .
actually , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you just do that as if you &apos;re called five mountain <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually been sent up in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there were jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that made the video last end so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> represent us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> get down on <unk> . <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times that year .
so the graphics looked like .
just like the &quot; double raindrop &quot; it seems to be from nothing .
what &apos;s going on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> it on , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson theater was a first one who did twitter on twitter .
so important is that one individual or group of <unk> <unk> is a point of view with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then this community was formed of people who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about that .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single single day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by using it , or make something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you stop that for crazy , you should know that there should be a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats are watching cats who look at this video .
important is important , the creativity that <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> there .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of that .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the floor that made it from a stupid joke that we all participate in .
today we don &apos;t find pleasure at something , we do with it .
who would have to anticipate that everything ?
who would have to predict &quot; double raindrop &quot; or rebecca black or rebecca ?
which <unk> would her write , in which that kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in a world , in which every minute of two days , is just really unique and unexpected <unk> as that mentioned video .
i admit , i was not very interested in , when i said a friend of mine , i would look at this great video , about a guy who was revolting in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i don &apos;t have a ticket , but often there &apos;s disabilities who don &apos;t make one properly on the <unk> .
because this is completely surprising and humorous , was a <unk> funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for anything new what we do .
and that all leads us to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , to who has to have access and in which the audience is defined by the audience .
as i said , one of the world &apos;s largest stars -- justin bieber made his beginning with youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we feel also as well as owners of our culture .
and that &apos;s not the characteristics of the old media and they also meet at the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i go into 10 minutes about the connectedness between three generations , and as the amazing strength of this connectedness , her mother and nights five days ago in a small boat , when she was sitting in a small boat in the middle of this little girl , when she was sitting in a small boat , and he never disappeared -- this little girl who is now living in san francisco and today ?
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a puzzle that will even put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who whole life from the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home was held together .
think of him at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he has to feel that his life has been a single waste of waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> now his .
he moved into silence back .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten his life .
i had to worry that it didn &apos;t have been free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to <unk> us , we passed it through .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> break down to lake <unk> .
my mother may was 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for you , the life had asked you a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat silent on the lake as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had she faced with pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat wore a little <unk> at the boat .
at a <unk> would have just my sister and i , then she had to drink myself and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady <unk> of the motor , the clap of each wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up , which came up many times , but <unk> of the men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the motor that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the <unk> coast , and at the young man who went up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first <unk> that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever tasted this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
we let us go down in <unk> , one of the middle <unk> suburb , whose population is made out of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smells of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were found between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on one line in a <unk> , six days , double layers , double layers .
it managed to find her time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and was placed in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to prevent . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but there were the rare but <unk> &quot; and here and there , and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
after where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the motions of our grandmother .
my mother suffered <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night , until their <unk> came to get her .
she opened a <unk> , made a <unk> and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds .
loan and sponsors .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student who asked <unk> demands on himself .
in the other , i was in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the insulation .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of that help , i was going to <unk> in my last year , as a young <unk> of the year .
and i became from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who had never heard of lectures , which she had never heard , and in homes that never would have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into a routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> back -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were telling each other the stories of their day and two daughters , who were telling each other the stories of their day and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was now so old as she was at the time when we had climbed the boat .
no one was never a possibility .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , living on the limits of possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i could not be able to buy with a career in law .
it had to give another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s fine to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to collapse of the collapse of collapse , can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now going to have enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you <unk> it .
opportunities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be greatly encouraged .
there was an energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> &quot; not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year long we had no cent .
at the end of one day , i cooking a huge bone soup that we shared us .
we were working down to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it were a few brilliant doing , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
your mother moved them alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother she hit .
without support of her husband , she was worried about a <unk> by court and <unk> in their own case , and a more larger <unk> when she won .
&quot; was not &quot; proving itself as <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . thousand miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she was coming to hi himself .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> their stories that we were still at .
after midnight , the monk came and said , he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she was holding them for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t stop them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s actually through women .
you see who we were and how life is shaped us , we can see that the men who might come in our lives , we &apos;d come to the <unk> .
the defeat would be too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think at the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , namely , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave <unk> , the <unk> , steady <unk> of the motor , the long horizon that nothing guarantee nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and she could be safely <unk> , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take with his camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 years .
i combined it with my previous predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the use of the camera was the process of planning .
and if you pick up a picture with a camera , end the process , the process , if you press on the trigger .
for me , it seemed to be more likely to go to go at the right place at the right time .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins at the process , when the trigger is pushed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected twist to it .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , they &apos;re not something that you really can capture , but i &apos;d always want to make it look like that , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about being an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but after all , but it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is realistic , but what we think for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and able to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly vaccine imaginable here that we can identify all in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way of combining each other , you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional looks like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine the same process .
it really goes just to combine different realities .
so the things that make an image realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that aren &apos;t three special images .
but combine something special like this here .
so the first rule is that bringing together images to have the same perspective .
second , together , they should have these pictures of the same <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- from the same altitude and the same <unk> .
third is about it , it &apos;s impossible to be able to be able to get the individual images and end , by creating it seamlessly .
makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast , and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic and disorders , we put the boundaries between the different images and we let them look like a single photograph between the different images and let a picture of a single photograph , even though a picture is basically hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part of being manipulated .
this picture is actually completely composed in reality from different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place when you find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take trade-offs with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i would need several months to find them the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a <unk> .
the bank comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to let it look like the swiss .
to reach a <unk> outcome , it runs from me from planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s every piece very well planned .
and if you do good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all tools there , and the only thing that limited us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> failed .
and i think that the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the <unk> was to make a <unk> .
that &apos;s not particularly scientific -- she provides a cup of coffee or tea and asking the patients , families , family , &quot; how goes ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button , in his own .
and every morning i get on .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 pounds of them .
it just works very simple : every time i get on the scale , you send my data on google health .
and there they &apos;re also going to get from my <unk> , so he can recognize where my <unk> is , and that &apos;s not just in the moment , in which i need <unk> .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i get on my <unk> and people talk to me , before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch just a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> , what can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could have patients smoking the smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they get to bring some kind of game to play their health better .
the next week comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> that you &apos;re on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to allow the people to measure your blood pressure , to give him their blood pressure to send him to their doctor and for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of control of your own ship , but can also help us with the challenge of the challenges that are in front of us , and can also help us with the challenges of the human health , and the <unk> of healthcare , twice .
make ways that make things that are easy to use and start embracing patients in the team in the team .
and that can get them through these ways , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know very precisely where all atms are around <unk> .
we know still one where all stations lie .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website and an <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and about 10,000 <unk> have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we have designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone &apos;s going to go , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , her <unk> , to find the next <unk> to find life .
and from today , we want to do this not just as <unk> as the product is called , but also as <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which is about helping us to behave like <unk> to behavior , to crowdsource of the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s collapsing , it &apos;s your own familiarity or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing , what we want to ask is that companies on the world is helping us to help us to help us .
these might be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still at its place .
please help us and try and try to improve health , but take into the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force ourselves to touch with environment by ...
it &apos;s going to pay for crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s load .
now -- we can just skip that -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i &apos;ve started a program to get the stars in technology and design to try to take sabbatical and work in an environment , which is so pretty much everything they actually hate them , we have to work them in the government .
the program for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> for the geeks .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what today with technology is possible .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
here &apos;s what it looks like , as if he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really addiction , when he really addiction , if he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> by a meter .
how did he come to look for this particular way of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston in the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has last february .
and they found that the city never <unk> this fire hydrant .
but one fellow one fellow , a man named erik <unk> , even something else and that was that the residents <unk> the sidewalks <unk> , right before these parts .
so he did what any good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him , if it <unk> <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al qaeda .
if you don &apos;t do that , it can take you away away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t make any other <unk> .
she &apos;s expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , with the citizens <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the citizens .
and chicago , they just introduced them to make people <unk> when it <unk> <unk> .
we now know nine cities that plan to use that app .
and she has been moving forward , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team who worked at a project last year in boston for three people for three people .
it was about a way to find out with parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
we told us later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s still nothing .
there is now a project in the california justice system that the taxpayer has paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then it goes from <unk> , is a kind of shot before the bug on the institution of government .
she shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private business , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that she represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things more effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country that get up and <unk> writing , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they didn &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s then , if you all forget your feelings about politics and the queue of <unk> and all the other things <unk> , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common is , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please i ask you that you &apos;re doing about it because the things change .
politics don &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their strength from us -- <unk> you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about people to choose in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
there &apos;s where you normally come out when you <unk> in your city .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your <unk> call center , like our fellow <unk> <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all going to see that people who call government because of many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and see very loud music and see if the cattle <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the &quot; new urban <unk> &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott volunteered to be human .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all the public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here , the digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to get into crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizens , but the government played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you would have to connect them to government performance , if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative services .
if a neighbor comes to the other , we sustain our communities .
call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is not the government .
and most people understand that , but you believe that one is the input of the input .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often we &apos;ve elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to try to choose a new political leaders -- and then we expect the government , and then not changed a lot ?
that &apos;s because the government as a farther ocean is and politics are the top <unk> .
and what is below , is what we call its bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and for which we &apos;re paying to do something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want that institution for us , we have to make its bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is taking place .
we have to be on the machinery of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed report , which has written a very detailed report to the <unk> about the <unk> .
this is not political , which is <unk> active .
now , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to achieve what we need to achieve , without getting an institution that can act in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but that needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make it possible , the function of the government in a way that actually can achieve something by creating society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the <unk> internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with it to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight , which is about who may talk to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your minds on every channel to every time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care to use their voices .
they use your hands .
they use their hands to write applications that the work of the government improves .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be to be a fire hydrant , weed to <unk> , a trash with a <unk> turn around .
and sure , we would have this <unk> <unk> all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we don &apos;t only consumers are paying taxes and receive taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government , until we improve the citizenship .
so the question that i have for you all here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role is to explain to the people as wonderful the new technologies , which are the emergence of that , i &apos;d really think of what i really do . and i thought , because i &apos;m going to look at what i really do . and also try to see what &apos;s going on , with these incredible <unk> , which happens so quickly that we can barely keep up .
i &apos;m going to start with you just a single , boring slide .
you could please just show the slide short .
this is a slide that i just selected out of my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the universal form .
this slide shows data a analysis from the performance of <unk> processor compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting one here is that this slide we often find in our field , which we often find in our field , a way on a <unk> curve .
with other words , each step here is equivalent to a power in the <unk> .
and this is an ultrasound that we need to use this guy scale on <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
another bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , we say that this is the years of the technology , which is a way of the technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would be on the <unk> scale very <unk> , in the form of a flat line .
but if this is what happens here , this changes the <unk> conditions .
so if the <unk> <unk> would be as fast as the <unk> progression , then we could get <unk> into a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
that had never been there before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , through which the scale is growing exponentially few years .
the question i want to ask you now is when you look at this exponential curves , you see they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is forever and forever as fast as well as now .
there are two options .
either it will be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new comes , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s it in about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think so something like this is going to happen .
is that really , then this means , we &apos;re here in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask and i also think of myself , is how this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that makes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of there .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still at the year 2000 .
more than that we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future is confined to a year since i am on the world .
i think the reason is that we notice that anything is going on .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make any sense of trying to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is so different , that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we are in the moment .
to make this to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things which really have nothing with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life &apos;s life .
i think that the big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
so if you look at the way that chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they <unk> the <unk> .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of that time , which is that at this time , little <unk> <unk> of chemicals that contain different types of <unk> .
some of these <unk> contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so growing .
all the ones that were , started there .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but these <unk> weren &apos;t about alive in the current sense , because each one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe by chemicals .
and every time it shared , they &apos;ve shared chemicals in <unk> quantities .
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> grew up , which has got faster than other and integrated more and integrated more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so this tend to be to survive longer , and they &apos;re catching up in <unk> extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is it going to be when this <unk> is a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , have this <unk> the ability to get information , information <unk> .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe the cell as information as information . and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
with other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way to find them , which allowed them to <unk> , so that this information was stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over the time of 2.5 billion years where they came in .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and every living creature uses exactly same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we &apos;re just to <unk> , even for the <unk> , the thing in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> that i try to keep in airports from <unk> .
in it , in it -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is made out of regular letters -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 .
so if someone would like a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
would i be in reality in fact , then i would have written them on a virus and in the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made her happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , very interesting step , in which things were completely different . namely , these cells began to communicate and exchange information , so communities came out of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is also the reason why for example the consistency grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how you can stay away from penicillin and have this information together , and now we have a lot of bacteria together , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate each other .
these communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve either survived together , or they went together . that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeatedly repeatedly , and by the evolution of evolution .
the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close to <unk> that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not going more on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level that evolution happened , no longer the individual cell was , but the whole <unk> , which we call organism .
the next step happened now within this communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structure .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that holding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning now happened within the time period of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn for example , a particular failure not food because she liked sick and made him sick , the last time he ate her .
this could be now within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before , hundreds of thousands of years , because of thousands of years , because these information evolved to be learned by the individuals who died because these <unk> were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> with this special <unk> because evolution could now happen within an individual .
she could happen within a time <unk> .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms would find a way to communicate each other .
again , as example , the <unk> of that <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and confusing idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and give basically <unk> notes of me , in the hope with this kind of confused idea in your head that has a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound around , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did have done , we have humanity , we have started to abstract .
we &apos;re running through the same stages , which <unk> through the <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , as we visualize data , process .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to make this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were there .
so , evolution can happen in the period period of microseconds .
you also have <unk> little <unk> , where he has shown a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
the first steps of history that i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> several hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding by itself and will so , i think , <unk> is the word -- if something its <unk> increases .
the more it changes , the faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding by itself .
i live professionally from building computers and i know that i use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using computers , without the recently being made in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead of doing instead , and whatever the designers of thinking <unk> , we think on a certain <unk> , that the machine and the machine makes it something far beyond , better and faster than we could ever make it themselves .
and she makes it partially with ways that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in the last time , is the evolution itself .
we install a <unk> in the machine , which is going on in <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed by random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> please have a hundred million randomly selected of instructions .
now , please take these randomly chosen instructions , take all the programs out , and pick the people who my policy is next to the next . &quot;
so in other words define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say , i want to take numbers out , that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve been used for this .
so find programs that are most likely to rank numbers out .
of course , the chance at random <unk> is very small , that they just spread out by accident , so probably no of the instructions actually do this .
but one of them likes to do with something more fortunate two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences of the sequences , which is what my policies came to the next .
store this off , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> all the <unk> that are the numbers at the best positioned .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that are something closer to the targets than others .
say , &quot; please again again . &quot;
<unk> them again .
please take some mutations one .
and try this whole again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes . or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that numbers are programs perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i have ever imagined by hand .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m quite sure that they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs which are going to do the job .
because your life depended on whether they made the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , <unk> he <unk> a map <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this plane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which is working together to make your flight safer . &apos; does that not <unk> you ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us things with a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that .
so <unk> <unk> us the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from today are feeding itself .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time , as <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t really make it really , what the hell we actually are actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after us .
i find it very <unk> from us that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of the whatever comes next .
now , the lunch says , before and i think i hear here now before i &apos;m going to get <unk> .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , at about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back at the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> had <unk> thirst , he took a bow , fired in the floor and water joined up .
now we do that with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to lose the sunset without camera and without tweet on my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full world full world full of pirates and <unk> ships in my imagination .
i came it so before , when our fancy clocks and cameras were dreaming to dream .
they kept us inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to do magic rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it makes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that storytelling always used more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; put your finger on each light . &quot;
and so -- here , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i live -- which is right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about such ways .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i didn &apos;t mean a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found quite exciting .
so you have to flip here the ipad and the fireflies <unk> .
and the illuminating the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and therefore every book is here every book and every world a little <unk> that i prefer here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these cards were static .
this map grows and lighting up and serves for orientation , in the rest of the book .
she also shows other places of the book .
i go in here .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> chambers in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that was challenging to new affairs , including the <unk> .
for the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids in their suite is that kids are sitting in their suite , with their computers , without go out .
but now , with portable technology , we can take our children into the natural world with your technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll sent to a search . you have to go out and with the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i had pictures of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do more .
this <unk> is <unk> . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower and tag .
in another chapter you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can ask online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we plan an interaction at which you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality by <unk> reality that appear on a plant .
at a place , the screen filling up the screen with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , they away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world , in which forces of the nature of technology is going to be closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest , and in places that there is very much hopelessness .
here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating that is , has given me very much force .
in the short time here , i became a clear one : ted has an identity .
you can tell here things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes to it , it gets important and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentation .
i believe that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a sense of one person , but that the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as <unk> doctor , you can do more .
and therefore i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household that was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had impact .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
she also was the starting of the place in our family in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
she was born to 1880 1880 , and the experience of slavery was shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
if i met her as a little boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
she put me so noticed that i could barely breathe . then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i encountered her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel even my hug ? &quot;
and when i said , &quot; no , &quot; <unk> me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; let me leave me in quiet .
she was something that made that you &apos;ve always wanted to be close to your way .
the only problem is that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her time , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins ran around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and in the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first i thought that that would be a game .
i saw her at and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this went so 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came up to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out to outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise that you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i saw you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first <unk> me , you &apos;re going to love your mom always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you need to promise with promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , granny , that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; as the next <unk> to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought to and said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is &quot; you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s aged a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , one day , my brother came home and took this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
we just <unk> there just like otherwise .
then he took a sip beer and offered my sister &apos;s one , and she took them , and then put me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . don &apos;t you . i want no beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do that . today we do that , you do anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do .
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now <unk> , what . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still do you because of the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all of all your grandchildren you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to confess to you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity does means .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell the people around us , they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they were something special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
1972 were 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are discharged on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i think <unk> our world changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black black black black black black black black , in prison , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles , baltimore , to 60 percent of the black young men either the black young men either in prison , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
but our system will not just be shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it becomes also by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treated much better when they are rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , changes the result .
yet , we seem to be quite satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few <unk> developments .
my state of alabama pulls them permanently , if you suffered suffered convicted .
here and today in alabama have lost 34 percent of the male black population .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic <unk> is as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world who sentenced children to death in prison .
in this country of our country , there are for children <unk> without genetic <unk> .
we already have a lot of process running .
the only country of the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us so that the real question is : has a man made for him to die for one of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : has someone deserves for a crime , but : have we made it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people who we executed is one that we have for innocent <unk> , the <unk> and out of death row .
one amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly someone with an airplane , if for nine planes , <unk> , one crashes .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our battle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking about my students &apos;s history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to have scared of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking to tell the people that they &apos;re going to stop saying that we have to stop in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after that terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions are in the historical context .
we poke each other .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> didn &apos;t get to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany about death .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
it was quite quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to bring us back to the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> from us , self-aware and specifically people <unk> . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like it would feel in a world , in which german state people would <unk> <unk> , especially if below <unk> , many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we put people up -- here &apos;s the risk of death , when the victim is white , when the victims is black , when the victim is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their earth , in their earth , the body is <unk> people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t engage with these difficult subjects , then the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> from suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i seem important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more commitment , more dedication to be in a complex world .
for me , the time to create the time and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged ones that never become at ted .
but think on a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational as we are , so very much we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t only come out of our minds .
they come from ideas that are powered by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe is that they &apos;re driving us , not just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything . but what we needed most , but what we needed most , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> must be engaged for that .
there &apos;s no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more from us than if we don &apos;t chose us .
she will deeply touch them .
as a young lawyer , i ran the great privilege to meet pink parks .
then woman parks always came back to <unk> , where she <unk> two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- a white <unk> , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women came together and talked about .
and at the way , he was <unk> up and said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks come into the city . we want to talk to us .
want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do if you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i will listen . &quot;
and i went over and listened to just .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i sat there , and after a few hours turned out to me , and after a few hours turned to me , &quot; well <unk> , tell me what the self is about the same right .
what do you try to reach ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
<unk> want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> for kids without genetic footprint .
we want something against the death penalty company .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then he rejected himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i believe that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to ask ways to ask these challenges : these issues , this sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true for each people on the planet .
when someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , he &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i believe in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , although they &apos;re so dramatic , so it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , we &apos;re not measured at the way of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged treatment , but about how she deals with the poor , the <unk> <unk> .
because in this context , we just start to understand the truly amazing things that make us mind .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas rush ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted to very rough presence .
i go to the <unk> and visit a clients who might be 13 or 14 years old , and who should stand as an adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge someone in something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
exactly , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also want to wish what one .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more properly , i started working at a ground .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as a client .
and i started with that . the headline was : &quot; politics , my poor clients , like a privileged , white <unk> , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my tennessee , i explained that failure of the <unk> and the police and the police as <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there is just error .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know anymore , whether i dreamed of these crazy street or actually written him .
and to my horror , i had not just written him , but also sent to the court .
a couple of months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and this crazy case .
i went into the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so heavy , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went to the stairs .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in trial .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i walked the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did they put these crazy radio ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
increasingly people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> was the <unk> full of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my favorite day , i saw the janitors on and down .
he always saw again through the window and could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man with a very challenged man in the <unk> and sat down straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the break , a <unk> came in , which was upset that the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , they don &apos;t give the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far <unk> , but that it <unk> the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our all survive with the survival of the survival of each individual .
that we have our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity to connect with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most importantly , i want to see those of you who just see that , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
they have in this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and belongs to them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , which is actually going to be a effort to do something of the <unk> , something of the <unk> , which is flowing into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , in california , you &apos;ll get a billion dollars for the death penalty for death .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> is not with a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> come in court .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this <unk> is suggesting that money in more <unk> and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> in america is extremely declining .
this fact is often coming into a context of elevated <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the classroom of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come on in prison .
we have <unk> ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> that people are going to go behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than you force them to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current impact doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they &apos;ve really brought a string on here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
if bin laden &apos;s death leads an increased <unk> with himself .
two : famine in somalia , famine . speaker three : spray the police spray .
4 : invasive <unk> . speakers 5 : dangerous <unk> .
6 : social decline . speaker would be seven : 65 deaths .
8 : <unk> . speakers nine : <unk> .
various speakers : <unk> . mass destruction .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of clips that i collected over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media would prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are precisely to share these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every second every second , our senses can ever process much more information in than our brain has ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival is the first stop for all the information of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our system system , our <unk> .
it placed and <unk> the whole information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news we prefer to look out to negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , &quot; is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , which is seven days , 24 hours on the day , 24 hours on the day , it &apos;s no wonder that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
potentially that is the reality .
maybe the enormous progress we &apos;ve made in the last century , which we &apos;ve made in the last century , as strong that it will be possible to create a world of excess .
now , i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have a big problems -- climate crisis , water and <unk> -- that we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at doing problems at very long time , but finally , they end up to overcome .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , average expectancy has more than doubled more than doubled , which has increased inflation from the inflation .
child mortality has to reduce a tenth .
that comes out that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and cost itself to be reduced a reduce .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time of <unk> life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is up to 80 percent in the past 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have defined poverty .
remember that a big percentage of americans who live below the poverty line , water , water , toilet , clothing , tv , mobile phones , air air and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth would never have been able to dream like this .
the basis for a lot of them form technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be on information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and <unk> all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and is thousands of thousands of thousands times more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth they &apos;re going on -- in good like in bad times , war or peace , recession , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , the faster computers .
she slows down for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left side , they &apos;re going up up .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , something that my friends with autodesk , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , that allow it to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , vaccination , vaccination , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer in &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i &apos;ve got the newspapers <unk> and after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would be available to every single owner .
four years ago , four years ago ray kurzweil and i here at ted a new university , which means &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students to all these technologies , with that , as these used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students , companies , products and services to create a decade , which can make a life positive life of human beings .
think about it that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that did exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , then i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating <unk> goods .
scarcity is actually <unk> , and technology is a resources of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he was invited the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable metal as gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome of <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not coming as pure metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we consume a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost for solar energy in india -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy dropped over 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of the decade of the sunny areas of the united states of solar energy , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water in abundance .
talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl sagan was the <unk> of 1990 , when it was <unk> , back to earth , went back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it meant ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we struggle to fight <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of the do it , and he gave me a little bit with them -- he gave me the permission with them -- he gave me the permission of them -- and by the many of you may have heard . it has been the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can make a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of coca-cola has just <unk> , a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola this technology is global in <unk> countries on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to achieve the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing mobile phones in developing health to the end of 2013 .
remember that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> as president , 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world , the information and communication in abundance has ever predicted .
and it comes even better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries , <unk> and music , libraries of medical imaging -- now are literally <unk> and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best part of this is potentially , what &apos;s going to be in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> of the <unk> the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize .
we demand teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a cell , that you can talk to the device , because it can be with ai equipped , you can test your <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team <unk> .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of health .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the institutes of license , and prevents a pandemic in their outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> against a population population is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we climb <unk> from two on five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds , which we never heard before , will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will you consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of an economic , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are flowing into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get through the use of the <unk> healthier , and they &apos;re going to get better through the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be trained to use 3d color and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about one sentence of new , never before .
how would it be to that to the oppressed , wherever they are to make a voice to make up and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring up ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that little teams that can be able to create extraordinary things , things that can create extraordinary things , things that can create big companies and governments only can create in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game that solved the effect .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game that can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
ever after its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern is better the proteins and the best supercomputer .
and when these people came up and looked at who the best <unk> of the world is , this was no <unk> , it was no <unk> , it was no <unk> , a woman who was working on the day as an assistant at the day , and at night the best <unk> of the world was .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power as individuals to provide the major challenges of our planet .
we have access to collaboration with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to the new challenges , and to do that , what necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i believe that it starts with a medical doctor and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in the store , when i can allow it to give a piece of my own wrong <unk> to give this a piece of my own wrong .
but before i come to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> near and move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of baseball with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and about statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic of which i hope most of you have heard of them .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat tolls .
that means that the player will beat three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball into <unk> , he comes up , he won &apos;t catch up , and who tries to throw the ball to the first base , hasn &apos;t done in time and the runner was in safety .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s certainly meets four from 10 from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who met the last <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , in which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less than i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> and they &apos;ll become a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is in terms of <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area and they have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> whose <unk> at <unk> .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the full branch .
and she &apos;s beating a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> one should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very well .
the truth is that nobody in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or a doctor should be .
what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re doing each of them , including me , into the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes any power on the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a obsessive <unk> student .
in the high school , in high school , the brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was too .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the nurses in the sisters of toronto , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and , and , every branch , every branch of each branch of each branch , which is <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i actually knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i moved with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the school with the impression that i knew , if i knew everything knew and everything knew , or at least as much as possible , as far as possible , that i was immune to that .
and it worked for a time for a time until i met a printer .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , in toronto as a woman , in the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i visited the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> council was looking for the <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i tune to them , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under <unk> heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , instead of pumps the whole blood flow , turns out a part of the blood vessels in the lung , and filling these together , so the <unk> came up .
and that was not difficult to <unk> diagnosis .
i asked them and made me to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a time of a year and a half hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and there i did my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually i made two mistakes .
i sent them back home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the receiver on and did what i should have had a call at my <unk> , so that he had an opportunity to make a own picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to do so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so able to worry for my patients without worrying without him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them back home , i sent a quiet voice into me , who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t that . &quot;
in fact , it was really missing me so very much at <unk> that i asked the nurse , which was about wife printer , &quot; believe that it &apos;s fine when they go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in <unk> ways , &quot; sure , i think it will go . &quot;
i remember as was it yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> came and brought them home .
and i went back to the work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , dungeon the hospital and went to a parking lot to drive with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was a other nurse , and there was another nurse , not the sister that had seen by woman printer , but one other three words to me and these three words fear the most <unk> that i know .
other medical doctors fear this as well , but the <unk> is very special because we just see the patients so fleeting .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients that they &apos;d expect home ? &quot;
asked the nurse , asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she came home after she had sent her home after i had sent her home , she broke them back to the <unk> , she took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure by 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous <unk> .
they hardly barely breathe and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them to the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i lived through this rollercoaster because she came after the <unk> on the intensive care and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days became clear that she would never awakening .
she had no <unk> suffered suffering .
her family gathered up .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , led to the <unk> .
the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you don &apos;t forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this firsthand .
the next weeks , i took me claims and i learned to the worst shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you don &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know all of all the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend &apos;s best , even though this one on <unk> <unk> , even though this one on <unk> <unk> , and you get a terrible discussion when one at the end , if one thing leads the bad conscience , and you <unk> that you &apos;re never doing such a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and never make the mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about , is the ones who make one in the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that says , which is not what you &apos;ve made bad , but that you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my <unk> , he was very loving .
he was talking to the family and i &apos;m sure that he made sound of <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked me these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
slowly , but sure it put it .
i started feeling better .
and then at a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke together , and i might tell me better .
and i was talking to me that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection and never <unk> a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did it .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot on and i in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and more than he went out of the door , he showed on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in your office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; remember the patients with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out that he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you &apos;re google , but it &apos;s no infection of the <unk> , but the top <unk> and causes the top of the <unk> .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went again through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt up and went back to the work until it went again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve got two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only got 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there were no imperfections in their treatment .
at one thought i would have <unk> .
i <unk> the x-rays of the kidney of the kidney . when that was without <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient was a <unk> in the lower right and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> for him to <unk> and asked my colleagues too .
and that did he and when he was a <unk> in the right in the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was fine .
both cases <unk> to me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , what happened in the first five years , but total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk about the quiet voice , which is really not happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was going into a room -- as now , i have no idea what you think about me about me .
when did you &apos;ve heard the last time from the <unk> about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yes , she goes to a cocktail party and there you might hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t want to hear somebody about the own mistakes .
if i had to go into a room full of colleagues , and to tell you your immediate support and started telling them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not reach the end of the second story before it would be really uncomfortable to you , anybody would move the subject and forget the rest of it .
and actually , in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> would have lost the wrong leg , then you believe me , i would have to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who make mistakes and those who make mistakes and the ones that are not making the <unk> results and those with good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response to how antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we do those who make mistakes out of medicine , that a safe system remains .
but there are two problems with this .
in my sort of 20 years of the medical <unk> and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and false treatments to be made so much of my first article that i have for my first article , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; black ways &quot; writing . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in which one of a day , in which one of 10 <unk> either is one of 10 <unk> or false <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , and more more more populous are causing more environmental or dead .
in this state , around 24,000 canadians die at <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , we &apos;ve got the institute for 100,000 .
both powerful <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a <unk> where the medical knowledge is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own an cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , make him <unk> and give it a slightly <unk> breath and give it a slightly <unk> breath and suddenly the story <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same cadence .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all that are stuck with errors are inevitable .
so if you take the system so , as i &apos;ve been taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end nobody &apos;s left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , in my show , black style , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; what &apos;s about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the microphone .
and then your pupils can expand , they &apos;ve come back in front of the head , then look down and swallow your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i <unk> . &quot;
what they need is an environment that they put in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the newly defined doctor is a human , white to make his humanity , accepted it , is not proud of making mistakes , but putting everything out of them , so it can be passed on .
she divides their experiences with others .
she supports if other of your mistakes talk about .
and she shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a loving supportive way so that all of those of them are .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people make mistakes from time at time .
so that the system is so that the system is going to create <unk> , which makes people make mistakes that anyone who can make care of the potential error , in which anyone who can be able to create the potential mistake , in fact , and that &apos;s also rewarded for people like me , and that &apos;s really rewarded for people like me , and for the <unk> of that rewards .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to get out of it to pass it together .
i don &apos;t know what they hold from me , but with that i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you think he was <unk> here .
you might think that he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very much &quot; common . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until in the 80s , he was placed in great style .
now he stands in the red list today .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , she &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they are originally .
the <unk> describe them still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to another concept , the <unk> <unk> , show up .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> a lagoon .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate me .
and i got a bad <unk> and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t really go from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and from a few mangroves .
there was <unk> from about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen lived well and made good of it in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was shrunk to half its greatness .
maturity you measure five centimeters .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had too lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story talks about my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> meant countries who started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing ship was called <unk> 4 .
i was driving on this and we made controlling the entire southern sea and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected with the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the reason of the ocean came on , and then then <unk> <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you lead a survey , and then start with the commercial fishing fishing .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals get <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , you threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a life alive .
she was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them because you could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain is going to grow up every time of fishers , if you drive into areas , in which they had never turned in .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our <unk> to the new level and don &apos;t call us in memory , which was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> .
with the time it changed . it changes because for people are their actions all of course .
every generation looks at the images that they capture at the beginning of their consciousness as standard and will derive everything from it .
the difference is then seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they only get the <unk> remains .
exactly that is now largely our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you could think now that the problem was in people who lived in <unk> societies , were killing , and that only became aware of a few generations , what they did .
because obviously an animal is going to have a lot of times , just once , before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose any frequent animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
with time , we focus on the big animals and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re less rare because we catch them .
with the time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
now , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm , scientists , that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous form , are not as well as they &apos;d like to argue the evidence .
there &apos;s for instance , for example , that the report of a <unk> report , who looked in this area of <unk> , which can &apos;t be used in this area , or not usually <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in sophisticated lives because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine reserve .
because by marine reserves , we basically put the past again .
we &apos;re looking at the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed and very low .
so , the people who see a marine reserve and that benefit from the insight that allows it to be able to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
prior to a long time ago , there were <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> will remind you to &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of &quot; why the people are so touched -- apart from the <unk> , why were she so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something <unk> that is going to be lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one that i &apos;m going to give , focus on cameron , so he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; <unk> .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , <unk> , you had to put if you had a typewriter to register this in the government .
they also had to register a sheet with <unk> out of this typewriter .
the reason for that : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could track the creator of this thought .
and we can &apos;t understand in the west , as anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be the speech speech .
in our own countries we would never do something like this .
but if you have to buy a new <unk> from the leading <unk> and print one side , then this page is bright yellow <unk> on every side , in a pattern that &apos;s clear to them and their printer <unk> .
that &apos;s happening today .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments , the way our own governments are using technology against us .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing ones today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> out of <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that their money made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve done it illegal by putting money out of our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , or also <unk> that have gathered over the keyboard as we &apos;ve collected over the keyboard .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
the second largest <unk> that we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about , an opinion or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and are to one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it of the money because of being anonymous , <unk> as anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are a case of ourselves , like the <unk> .
it shows a great model of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or was it that .
in the last fall , it had to register , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system hard hack .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of this group , whether he had it for possible that because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a result of such expensive ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate you takes when you have a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example gmail .
now we &apos;re all using all , or many of us , gmail or one of your competitors . but those services are particularly common in <unk> states like gmail , because they know that they can use more trust as a local <unk> and that they are encrypted by <unk> , so that the local government cannot <unk> in their conversation .
but can you get into a foreign expert .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in <unk> .
how does it behave with the arab spring and the things that happens in egypt ?
now in egypt , the insurgents in april , the headquarters in april of egyptian <unk> . and they found a lot of records .
in these records was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes of one in germany , that the egyptian government has sold a couple of programs that they had sold -- in very large framework -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is exactly here .
so western governments <unk> governments with <unk> , so they can approach their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago of the so-called <unk> . this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , then with quite a security <unk> .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their connection on .
they use resources like the <unk> , to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> to collect their <unk> .
so if we keep thinking about these things , then the obvious answer would be saying , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i don &apos;t have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not to the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments , our governments , is every right that we &apos;re giving , forever , forever .
and trust we , trust we blind to the future government , a government that we might have to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were produced <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : modules , made out of cement with the set of charge .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the ability to build things that were bigger than we , building buildings , a brick after the other .
essentially , the <unk> was becoming the <unk> to the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , the lego came out with it .
it was automatically called <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has essentially taken the <unk> , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at bell labs , the next revolution , the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> , which has taken us from a world of static , <unk> blocks to a world in which was all interactive .
as the <unk> , allows us to build the transistor much larger , more complex cycles , a brick after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept this not that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
all of what you need to do is is a blue and a green one , and they can build very quickly .
you add a blue at a green , and you can make light .
you can insert a switch in and so they built a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is here , and they &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
over the simple play , is actually <unk> , actually is pretty powerful .
instead , that you have to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to use them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to accelerate this is flashing or slow , they just turn on this button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> to children and they see them playing with .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how they start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in everyday and they don &apos;t learn in school .
as for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod to respond to the touch .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience with no experience , which started to play with <unk> as material material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper bottles and water bottles ...
a few weeks ago , we brought out of risd , and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box and paper -- and said , &quot; does what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a lobster from squishy that fear in the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material for all .
so <unk> open source .
you can go on the website , all the <unk> file and they make yourself .
we want the world of the creators of the creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world , in which we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull up and start to invent them .
thank you .
