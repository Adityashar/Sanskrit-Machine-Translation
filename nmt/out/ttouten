you know , one of the great <unk> during travel and one of the joy of the research is , in common with people who can remember the old days , which is still in the wind , touch them on the <unk> stones , taste on the bitter leaves of the plants .
simply knowing that <unk> still travel beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the elders of the inuit are even full of the elders of the inuit , which is the idea that the world is where the world we live in .
and of course we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to get out with the <unk> separation from death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing and dance and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the sahara , and this is a colleague of <unk> in the andes , and this is a colleague of <unk> in the desert , or even a <unk> of the <unk> in the desert , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there &apos;s another different ones , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about the earth &apos;s orientation .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only meet hope with hope .
together , the myriad cultures in the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that are important to the earth as important as the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> project , and <unk> can be able to think of the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , <unk> ideas and dreams , <unk> and intuitions that are being defined by the early human imagination .
<unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re able to do as amazing species .
and as the same way the biosphere was heavily eroding , this was the <unk> -- only more speed .
a biologist , for example , a biologist , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are just going to be extinction , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the area of biological diversity -- corresponds to what we &apos;re known as <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the defining indicator of this is dying .
when each of them was born in this room , talked about 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the totality of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a <unk> , with the soul of a certain culture of a certain culture .
any language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a turning point , a turning point , an ecosystem more spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages , today , today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , just half the ears in monterey .
they didn &apos;t teach infants anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be lonely as the silence is to be <unk> , one of the last of your people who speak your language , not a possibility of your language , or to expect the wisdom of the ancestors ?
and yet , it happens this terrible fate , in fact , somewhere on the earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , he dies an elderly , every single person , the last <unk> of the old language with the grave .
and i know some of you , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we &apos;re all talking about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , don &apos;t leave that language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you on a journey through a journey through a little bit , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to try to understand them , which is actually going to be lost .
now , there are some of us out of ourselves that i say , if i say , &quot; different ways of his being being , &quot; really different ways of his own .
take this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of <unk> , the people of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east of sacred snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t be different between the colors between the colors and green , because the <unk> is the forest that people depend upon .
you have a strange language , and a <unk> call that will be called linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this is rooted in the <unk> past , and the strange of these big houses , which are spoken for the <unk> six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who &apos;s learning a language .
they &apos;re just listening to and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating strains that i &apos;ve ever lived in , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was contacted peaceful in 1958 .
in 1957 in 1957 , five <unk> contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they took shiny photographs of himself from the air that we would pay as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforests in their life has never seen anything .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , nothing and <unk> that this is business business of cancer , kill the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t have killing the spear .
they train each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we were tracking eight generations back and they found two cases of a natural death , and when we had the people that people had become so old , he gave them that one of the people that he died , that he died , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , she had a clear idea of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a 40 steps , and determine what animal animals this owned .
in the early age of years , i got a really amazing task when i asked me to go to haiti and the secret societies that were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> societies that were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> , and the poison that was used for that to make sure <unk> .
to give you a sense of one sense , i had to give a sense of something about this remarkable faith , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them to read the big world , what would you say ?
christianity , buddhism , buddhism or whatever .
a continent continues to leave out , because the guess was that there was no religious belief , of course , there was no religious belief . of course , it &apos;s just the remains of these very profound religious thoughts that was during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what happens is so interesting , is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living people give the spirits .
ghosts can be <unk> from underneath the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to <unk> the soul of the living , so that it &apos;s going to be <unk> for a brief bright moment to god .
<unk> would like to say , &quot; your white goes in the church and say about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple , and you get god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the spirit . how can you get damage to you ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , <unk> , an amazing visualization of the spirit of the mind the body is so to affect the body that it &apos;s going to affect the body in a state of extreme arousal .
well , of all people who i met was the <unk> of the sierra nevada <unk> de santa <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization that are the heart of colombia in colombia , and in a result of the conquest of the conquest of the conquest , they moved to the people in a lifetime of <unk> , which is rising across the caspian &apos;s atmosphere .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who never been conquered by the <unk> .
so to the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood ; the education of education is very extraordinary .
the young members of the age of three and four years from their families are separated from their families , and in a <unk> world in the base of the glacier for 18 years in the base of the pregnancy , they were chosen to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , they spend now <unk> <unk> in the lap of great mother .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re introduced culturally into the values of their society , values that their prayer and their prayers , their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- that &apos;s <unk> .
finally , at the end of this amazing <unk> , they will suddenly take out one day , and for the first time in their life , you see everything you have learned in the abstract <unk> , all of a sudden , everything you &apos;ve learned in abstract <unk> , all of a sudden , everything you &apos;ve learned in abstract <unk> , and the priest <unk> , &quot; do you see ? it &apos;s really what i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about war and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> , and the old tape of the fancy wild , which is a <unk> thought , or say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , native aren &apos;t <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be out of <unk> weakened .
it &apos;s not a lot of place to do a lot of space in <unk> <unk> , or the cold winds of tibet , and they &apos;re shaped by the idea of the earth that &apos;s shaped to the idea of being aware of the idea , but on a very close intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it can only exist in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes that you &apos;re going to tell you that the mountain is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and you have a different relationship in montana , and a different relationship in montana , and a different relationship in montana , that a mountain is a bunch of stones that can be eroding .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that is defined between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the woods of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
this was what i made me to another person as my friends among the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits in the world are able to live on the world &apos;s spirit of the world , spirit that they would be involved in their own <unk> .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> that many of you have heard of , the most powerful preparation of the <unk> &apos;s repertoire .
so what &apos;s fascinating is not just the most fascinating thing , is not just the most amazing potential of this thing , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , but there &apos;s going to be able to get the leaves with the leaves from a <unk> of the family with the name of the <unk> with the name of the <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong dna that serotonin is very similar to serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff <unk> , this substance that they have in different types of species also in different ways .
this powder is something like this powder is something like <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not make a distortion of reality , but resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who came up with the <unk> mushrooms in mexico , and i said that i was suggesting that you could not put this <unk> as a <unk> , because in the moment you feel the impact , you know , you know , you know , you know , to experience a <unk> .
but the thing with <unk> is that it &apos;s not going to be taken by <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> in the human gut , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
you can only be taken out with some other chemicals with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now , what &apos;s fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> of exactly the way that are necessary to <unk> <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people from a flora of 25,000 species of plants that are not able to find these two <unk> plants that are combined in the way that , in this way , they create a kind of <unk> version , so that it &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the native americans , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
and this tribe , they have 17 varieties of dopamine , which they &apos;re all in very distance in the forest that can see for our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them , as you found your <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take any of the 17 varieties of wood and they &apos;re going to sing to one in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than <unk> .
well , the problem is the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy of us have the difficult situation to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the past , as the real world , that means our world , the world , that means our world .
so , fact , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to be in the 20th century in 300 years , in 300 years , but in fact , in fact , as an era of biological and cultural diversity on the earth either active and the passive diversity of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new parts of the dance .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> listened to sioux , when they were bow and arrow and arrow , when americans stopped americans , when they stopped americans and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology are threaten the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you have <unk> in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not <unk> , and they have been able to see that these cultures are going to be covered by raw forces , whether it &apos;s <unk> by raw <unk> in southeast asia , if you &apos;re going to see them in the <unk> of <unk> , which is going to be humiliated with raw <unk> , which is going to be humiliated with raw <unk> , and in the case of the <unk> , where they &apos;re <unk> in the forest , or in the case of the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , which were <unk> during the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i work a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people is convicted in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , not only not not not not to be charged , but in general than part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you don &apos;t have seen it at <unk> level .
and i went with a young colleagues with a young colleagues in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and only when i saw a lhasa meeting , i saw the statistics behind the statistics that you &apos;ve heard on the statistics and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified by the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug bug , with their holiness the people in nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for being wealthy .
he was smuggled in the age of two years in prison to hide under her <unk> , because she didn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that this brave did was <unk> into a <unk> .
one day , they went on an <unk> <unk> , and they had to put it into a heavy camp for seven years camp .
the suffering is <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end of us , we really have a choice in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a world &apos;s world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that it was their greatest fear , we would see the whole range of human imagination , we wouldn &apos;t only see the entire range of human imagination , but that we would see the entire range of human imagination , but we &apos;ve forgotten that it had ever been different possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood , <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization , had created specialization .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow history don &apos;t tell me that we all respond to the challenges that we are to the ensuing millennia .
when we ask these myriad points for the human part , you respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to get the possibility of what we are : people with all people who are the importance that all people are aware that all people have to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the north end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story .
the canadian government has not always done very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of the <unk> of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather man refused .
the family , the fear of his life took him all weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit weren &apos;t afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sledge was originally made from fish who was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out out , he took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces began to work , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the pages of the beach , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he took the dog and he took the dog and <unk> the skeleton of the dog , <unk> a little bit of the dog and <unk> a other dog and <unk> on the <unk> with the inner belt .
you can do anything like anything .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native leaders in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit , in april 1999 , all of control over an area , which is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of them .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can be looking for their people and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least , at least for those of us who have traveled to the distant goals of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in the past , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children are part of our own children of the geography .
what we finally do at national geographic is trying to believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe it &apos;s not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we companies a series of trips into the <unk> where we take our audience to places like such cultural wonders , that the world has made a really multicultural <unk> , that the world has made it in a truly multicultural world , that this world has made it in a really multicultural world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do is i &apos;m going to show you as fast as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment where you &apos;re either locally or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can seamlessly and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in a way of new ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of <unk> , and this is a scan of <unk> and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that makes the performance of a system like that , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation of the brain and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a magazine or a newspaper to read a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with a medium of scale .
we also made something about this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a <unk> display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or the technical specs .
and this is really reaching these ideas to stop this limits for the screen on the screen .
and we hope that this is no longer <unk> and others that means not need to be necessary .
and of course , the mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this domain .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> up at the top picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which really connects two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who was a very good research in washington <unk> , <unk> at the university of washington , under the counseling of steve <unk> at the world .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s going to be driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we can make these kinds of views in which we can go through pictures and have this experience of the resolution in the resolution .
but the spatial orientation is here in fact , in fact , that matters .
the <unk> have captured these images together with the real space , in which these images that were made in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , correspond to the elements of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , and these things became <unk> in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have some time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s what are a lot of <unk> .
i &apos;d like to go straight straight to one of the most <unk> data data data , and this is from an early prototype of <unk> that we first worked in the bottom of this technology , and this is not necessarily the punchline to this technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a gothic photo of the cathedral notre dame , which was taken entirely in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men on flickr , and they get pictures of men on princeton , and each of this orange is a picture that represents a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re in relation to each other in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
now , you know , i never believed that i &apos;ll end up to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception desk .
and i guess you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : all of these kinds of cameras : everything is , from the <unk> to professionals , a relatively large number of them that are all <unk> in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the strange strange .
many of them are on the face of the faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame that was right right .
we can shift from a poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s going to be data from all -- from the whole collective memory of it , how , visual the earth looks -- and everything becomes connected .
all these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all around the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the labor of the labor of stephen <unk> to virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , growing and use its use for the use of the application with the application .
their own photographs are going to put with metadata with metadata to a different person .
if someone has been hard to have the effort and all of these saints labeled and tell you who they &apos;re all , then my photo of the notre <unk> would <unk> with all this data , and i can use it as a start to go into this room , and i can use it as a point of <unk> <unk> of different people with the use of the other <unk> experience .
and of course , the byproduct of all the are the immense virtual models of the earth that are not only going to get through <unk> or satellite imagery and so on , but in collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software is that at a certain time , in the next time , all of the images that are used by someone in the world are common to each other ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want them to create <unk> between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the <unk> information that have many of these images .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures , where they put sentences , and one of the text of the website contains a lot of information , which is a lot of information .
but how would it be when the picture you connected with all their images ?
then the scope of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope , in unison with other things you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
so official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western societies .
so the official project works : if our goal is to maximize the common good of our citizens , this is mainly by the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , valuable , a basic assumption for human .
if people have freedom , each of us , each of us is to do the things that make our good , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , you have more freedom , and the more freedom you have , the more powerful you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply system that no one would come to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enables us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 degrees of <unk> , and 12 <unk> , and 12 <unk> who could buy a large number of own lettuce in their lettuce , in the unlikely case that none of the store is right .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket .
and then you &apos;re going to go to the <unk> business for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in that one of this one , there is so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together <unk> million different facilities in the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other fields -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy , you could have lost every phone of the phone as long as you were bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of it was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice now in telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people go to business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t go too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more relevant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer in the united states that they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you &apos;re going to go to a doctor and the doctor says we could do b or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , i would , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy , and that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the burden of someone who knows something of someone who knows something of someone who knows , and therefore most likely in the best constitution is a decision to make a decision -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like it , for people like them and me , if you think about it , don &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you &apos;re expecting us to call the doctor in the next morning and asking to ask a change in the prescription .
so , something like our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we <unk> no identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re often new new as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , they need to decide what kind of person to be you .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which <unk> was that almost everybody had one had one , and they were able to get as fast as they could , and then kids were able to get them .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did .
now , it &apos;s easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married later ? should i just have kids , or a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get to you and don &apos;t get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;ve been blessed to be blessed with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single time on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner , by the way i don &apos;t get to tell you that <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again , again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids in playing football play , and we have our phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other waist , and our own laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re off all of them , every minute we <unk> our child <unk> , we also ask us , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do something bad .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects to people .
it &apos;s an effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> .
so with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another memorable example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to me on <unk> <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> who had the employers who took for two percent .
you offer 50 hours of -- 10 percent less employees , as if you only offer 5 . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to take it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow is never coming .
you know , you know that it &apos;s not just that people need to eat food if they &apos;re not enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money to travel , it means that they &apos;re so hard to be able to make large doses of your employers .
they don &apos;t give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> per year , who would have been happy to multiply their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think that the world looks like this .
you want to make the decision really really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment of investment , or even wrong .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is one of them in order to be involved in the big choice , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect , and it &apos;s not perfect , and what &apos;s going on is that you have a more decision , and what &apos;s going on is that you have a better decision , and what &apos;s going on is that it seems to be made on their decision , and this regret seems to be on their happiness , even if it was a good decision .
the more ways there is , the easier , it &apos;s no longer regret at all this is <unk> for the choice .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has been doing a big point today by doing the way he told the way that we think depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives for concerns , it &apos;s just an attractive qualities of thinking about alternatives that you keep you less happy with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they would have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my childhood neighborhood is gone .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed two weeks , day to have a great parking lot .
<unk> increases the happiness that we get through our choices , even if that &apos;s what we &apos;ve selected is fantastic .
and the more ways it gives us more attractive properties , the more attractive qualities of these choices are going to take into account .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is some statements .
he makes a statement about it in now and maybe things slowly to do things .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is , always who you choose to decide , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things might have many attractive qualities , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this was struck me when i wanted my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans in which , and they bought them , and they bought them , and they were incredibly <unk> , and they were incredibly <unk> , and if she carried them long enough , they &apos;ve got it , &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to be <unk> , easy or a long ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw down the bottom , and after i realized , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that the only way was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour with all the damn jeans , and i &apos;m going to say the business -- and i say the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all this selection allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it .
the reason for the reason that i was worse , with all these available possibilities , my expectations of what a good set of jeans is going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations when it was just in one way .
when they came in 100 species , damn one of you should have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had was so disappointing to what i expected .
add from opportunities in the lives of people in humans , the expectations of people have increased people as good as good .
and this leads to the results of the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this . because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it used to be better than all worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people who were a comfortable surprise .
today , in the world in which we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , the industrialized citizens , who are the industrialized citizens , as expectation -- the best thing you can hope is as good as you expect it .
they &apos;re never comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are my expectations .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come -- the secret to heroism are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment ago -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i could not do better . i didn &apos;t get myself .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
and finally , a consequence of a limb sitting with a terrible standing jeans if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask why if you &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why , the answer is in the answer . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : they .
they could have better do better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so if people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , you feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re blaming themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> of the depression , and also , that people have been so high , and then you have suicide , and then , if you have to explain these experiences , and then if you have to explain these experiences , think about it .
and so the key thing is that it &apos;s going to be better to improve ourselves , and we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is really wrong , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is something more more than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice better than a little selection .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time that we &apos;ve been improving our greater powerful .
now , as an important question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an <unk> question , the thing about thinking about that , which is what all of these selection is in the industrialized societies , is the material .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you whose problem is not a big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is , and it &apos;s angry : steve <unk> has told you about how this more expensive and hard to do the car seats don &apos;t help -- it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
you worry that we &apos;re worse there .
if something about what the people of our society enables us to make decisions in the societies in which people would have shifted , not only the lives of humans would be improved , but we would also be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> will be worried that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great selection of us are <unk> .
finally , read this cartoon , please , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , lower happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost the perfect security to limited -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> being <unk> is a recipe for misery and , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects already before the human genome and what could mean , and what it could mean , about finding new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re going to start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists are trying to understand , and that &apos;s at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to the minimum components to make it .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now we try to ask , whether we can regenerate life or if we can live new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma dioxide , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to avoid about a hundred genes on the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic card , which is very simple , compared to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple , but if we can eliminate all these genes that we can eliminate one according to the others , it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to make this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules ever before ?
and if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in life has exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has increased it very slowly , and so we &apos;ve got a very exponential curve now .
we started about 15 years ago .
it was actually a few years from starting with a full-time review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out , it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you do a piece , the more mistakes you do .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces and <unk> the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
and we made little pieces , made a <unk> and have a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and made into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral code .
the viral particles are then released by the cells , and then they made e. coli .
recently , i talked about the oil industry , and they said that they could understand this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in software in software in the software in a biological system .
but we wanted to go further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters in the size of the virus , so we thought we could vary it into tapes , which we could vary the size of the tube to understand what the individual components are the living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in computer , these digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first 1995 was the <unk> in a mistake .
we found 30 mistakes , when we used the original sequence , if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design of design is to create pieces of 50 letters long , and they have to overlay that with other dimensions , to build smaller power .
and we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in <unk> .
you think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- this letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we &apos;ve only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve just designed the pieces so that we could take them apart with enzymes , and there are enzymes to enzymes , and there are enzymes those repair and forth .
and we started to make pieces , starting with the pieces of five to <unk> letters in these days , added these together to put these together to self-assemble and self-assemble .
in each step , we have these pieces in surplus as we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , it looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right work -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then these are not just going to grow in e. coli , and it &apos;s beyond all of modern molecular biology , and so we applied ourselves other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to repair dna to put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
you see in the upper field , the chromosome is just falling apart .
so 12 to 24 hours later , it has come together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a subset of the molecule that we &apos;ve made that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve just used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve got them <unk> , they put them together automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we actually can see it with the <unk> .
this is footage over a long time for six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over <unk> letters on <unk> code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule that has ever been created by human structure .
it has an <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would include the other pages , only around this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s very simple with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simple when you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus , you just take the nucleus , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this cloning .
at <unk> is the chromosome into the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown a whole chromosome of a chromosome from a cell and going on this .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly said , they could pick up the two apart as humans and mice , and it was very amazing as we could pick it into a cell , and it was very amazing than we gave it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to appreciate our very <unk> .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get something further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here , or a third of <unk> , a third of <unk> , every time of thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people that can imagine evolution as a gene that has changed at a moment , much of biology has missed .
there is enzymes the <unk> are called the <unk> that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we put it on .
it was <unk> in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue because of the genes we &apos;ve added in .
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species of the species , and it had completely <unk> into a new species on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we go back .
it may sound <unk> <unk> , but we can be able to change how we shift changing things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution
and i have argued that we could possibly create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be created a new shape of the cambrian explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re <unk> on a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people have existed on this planet for every year in 1946 every year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have food with food , with fresh water , medicine , fuel for a half billion people .
it becomes a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion drums of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million drums on a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
so we &apos;ve got all of our discoveries from all the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of this .
we &apos;re in the first line in the limits of biological reality and that of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this fast <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we &apos;ve now got the opportunity to build a big robot of the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to make these processes or drugs , new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , and so on .
this is a shot of actually <unk> that we &apos;re working with that you &apos;re actually going to sit down and make a new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
so we &apos;re focusing now on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn , recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have fuels in the world &apos;s energy and third generation that are going to be coming out of a lot of energy systems , like <unk> or different species of <unk> .
but as we think , the only kind of biology is a huge impact without more than the availability , and the limitation of their availability , is when we see co2 as the material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first to be the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , with almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of energy .
and we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could be just going to be <unk> , it could be <unk> carbon dioxide , to power that process .
within a short period of time we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? you know , you know ?
but the same time we &apos;re working on doing the same approaches to use vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back and have a dollar too little , if it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in the transportation system .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes can be accelerated today , today of synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we are light years away from people to improve people . our goal is only that we have a chance to do long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted , i &apos;ve been going to have a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as far as that . and for all those who are not there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever became -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than an average second of the universe , in the beginning of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just amazing ambitious .
so this is the machine below geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these areas of detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
this is a spectacular picture of atlas in construction so you see the scale .
last year last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge events in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> thing that all the way all the way to <unk> the lhc was intentional at a part of the lhc <unk> to <unk> an rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10 , we knew that the machine works , what is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> , or this when someone went to google side and the front page and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
a week later , there was a problem with the machine which was to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here here here .
and these wires are spreading through its <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
well , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you get them very far down , it becomes called <unk> .
so at negative degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets , there was a <unk> .
and it heat heat slightly up and <unk> resistance and <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is very wonderful , if you imagine that the magnet weigh 20 tons and shifted about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over your way back .
at the end of march will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and you &apos;re going to turn to june and july , we can collect our journey on the way to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a way , these accidents are again about the value of science and <unk> on such borders , and it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think the fact that it is so hard to reach the fact that we reach beyond our borders , makes the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , and <unk> <unk> , who was what i suspect when he defended the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his training was so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as to assume that our scientific ideas are in the nature of the human mind , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect it to ever change .
however , recent thing is a recent thing in my life and my career has happened to be done to me to think of my work completely .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , love <unk> -- that , unlike all of my years went out to the world , and a big <unk> , <unk> international <unk> .
and the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i come to be treated as if i &apos;m going to get the doom .
seriously -- stop <unk> !
for example , they come up with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that they never will <unk> ?
don &apos;t you have a fear that they &apos;d come up with their entire life and never create a book that cares about the world ? never again ?
okay , the power really makes guts .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first told them about 20 years ago , that i wanted to be a writer that was faced with the same way of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> did you have not afraid to have success ?
don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of an <unk> kills ?
you don &apos;t fear that you have a craft in your life , and you never get something that you are going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things that no one was going to take a result .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently and question : why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that of someone should be expected to do that he was afraid to do the work ?
and what exactly is in the creative company , that they do insecure about the reciprocal mental quality -- in a way , how other jobs do not do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , he was asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have a chemist for the centuries of <unk> people .
we were writers , but we have writers , but not only the writers , but not only the writers of all of the <unk> , seem to be the reputation , mental incredibly unstable .
all you need to do is to watch the bitter head of really great minds alone from the 20th century , which were young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> the <unk> , they were really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> each of my books had killed me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even twitch when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of <unk> , and we &apos;ve seen this kind of <unk> that creativity and <unk> , of course , <unk> and <unk> , of course , <unk> and that art -- always the <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea of all right ?
do you feel about that ? because with only one centimeter distance , i feel like i don &apos;t feel at all this point .
i find them <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken over the next century .
i think it better when we encourage our big creative encouraging .
and i definitely know that it was to me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start with this dark path of the guess , <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
this is -- see , i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work that was being judged after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s because , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here , and it &apos;s most likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that you can get someone to start to start at nine in the morning , and start to drink that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to me that i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological construction building .
and somehow i have to find a way to make a way to make a safe distance between me and a very natural idea of how the response will be on the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for models to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to see if you might be creative , and we have tried to see if we could be creative , as we can help with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this was looking at me in old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in the old greece and rome have not believed people that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant unknown source , which comes from a distant unknown source of people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> demons .
from socrates known that he believed it was he thought he would have a <unk> that <unk> him from the distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really thought a genius is a particularly smart individual individual .
they believed that a genius was a genius about the kind of magical creature was that they were literally living in the walls of a <unk> -- like <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the artist in the work of a kind of <unk> and the result of the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so , right ?
the artist of <unk> was protected , like , for example , for example , too much , right ?
if your work is brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not a whole mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was <unk> .
so people in the west have thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance and the renaissance changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the middle of the universe -- over all the gods , and there are no room more for mystic creatures to take orders from divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from an individual .
for the first time , in history , you hear people like this or say a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to say , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person to allow him to think it or the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence of all them is a little responsibility , human psyche .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the cancer and warps whole ego , and it creates all these <unk> expectations to success .
i think that this is our artists of the last 500 years in the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t get the <unk> from 500 years of humanism not just zap a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would register <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything that i &apos;ve heard about , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that is -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , he can feel really like <unk> .
i had such a encounter when i met a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which was over the fields , but she told me that she was working on the fields , and she told me that she was working on the fields , and she told me that she was going to work and listen to how a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it was like a <unk> train of air .
it would be <unk> on the country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could just do one of a moment , and this was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil .
she ran as the devil was followed by the house while she was followed by this poem , and it had to get it quickly enough to get a piece of paper and a pen had to get it to get it through them , capture and capture on the leaf .
at others , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran and ran it , but she didn &apos;t missed the poem , and she didn &apos;t missed it , and she said it would go to land , and she said -- <unk> after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost missed .
so she &apos;s going to go to the house , and i &apos;m looking for paper and the poem goes through them , and she reaches a pen as it goes through them , and then she said -- was it like to grab with her other hand and put it .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she took it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and on these opportunities , the poem was fine and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought <unk> was creepy -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up with the same time and <unk> and <unk> me and pretty awkward .
but even i &apos;ve got this thing in my <unk> sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had work , or ideas that &apos;s from a source of me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we start to lose this in relation to it without having our minds , but even in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living of the world is how you can do this the musicians of tom <unk> , and i had to interview him a couple of years ago .
we were talking about this subject , and you know what , most of his life , was tom , the embodiment of his life , was trying to dominate these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him , and she lived with them to deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go into a freeway <unk> in los angeles , and there &apos;s all changed for him .
he went at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is a little bit tangible for him , and he wants them . and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he &apos;s no <unk> .
so it begins , these old <unk> <unk> in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be haunted by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of <unk> , he just listened to .
he finished all the train , and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky , and he said , <unk> excuse me , can you not see that i go ?
i &apos;m looking at this as well as could i just write a song ?
if you &apos;re really going to exist , come back at a second moment , when i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> is somebody else today .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole team has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , was no times when he took the genius , where he was doing anything like a anger , where he was going to come from , and he realized that it was no <unk> , <unk> thing .
so it could be an surprising , weird collaboration , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , internal thing that was not quite a tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;d saved me .
and this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , and i fell in one of these stages , and i went to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s going to start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this will ever be written .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just get the project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky , and i tried .
so i raised my view of the manuscript and i talked my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i talked loudly : you hear , you , you , you and i don &apos;t know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not quite my fault , right ?
because you see that i have all i &apos;ve invested , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up and push your fraction of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to go on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to show up to the board that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like this , in the end of centuries , in the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and music , who were stopped stopped for hours -- to dawn .
this <unk> were great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , and again , very rare , happened something special . one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you all have seen in your life , have a performance like this .
it was as if the dancers had <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> . he did nothing different than he did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything made together .
and all of a sudden , he seemed no longer more human .
it &apos;s got up from the inside of the inside , and the bottom of it , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when it happened at the time , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came from the <unk> of the <unk> , they changed these practice , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear at <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer in spain has done a little magical something magical , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great than that , it &apos;s a gorgeous look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky morning on the next morning when the dancers themselves wake up , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never be again to these highs .
and maybe someone will never call god name when it turns . but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> corrections living .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be full of <unk> if they haven &apos;t believed in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a loaner -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of their life that will be passed on to somebody else when they &apos;re ready .
if we start thinking about it , all that changes .
so i started thinking , and so i think , i think , for security in the past months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to appear soon -- as dangerous , very expected , very expected to succeed to my <unk> .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;m going to be crazy about this , is no fear .
not <unk> .
make your job .
be on your contribution to your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the dumb divine divine divine is calling you to the site , decides to show a little moment of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance still your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that , and i think we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , that you just love the mere human love and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , who had declined nearly about three million years of the size of the lower 48 states for 40 percent .
but this is not strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it shows not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the beating heart of our global health system .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in the summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you see , it grows into the <unk> , it &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it <unk> <unk> in the summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood that comes from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , there &apos;s the warming of the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , in which there is large amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if it is <unk> , by the microbes that will be done by methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could double if we cross this critical point .
today , in some shallow lakes , in the shallow methane from itself .
professor <unk> , walter <unk> in alaska is with another prosthetic lake in a different flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it <unk> .
and one reason , that huge heat warms up from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much greater than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know , how the level of sea level goes up through the sea level , they <unk> into the ocean .
these rivers are taking very fast .
and on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest wave centers on the planet .
last month , the entire continent was now having a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> , is particularly closely at melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top new lakes that were frozen a few years ago .
forty percent of all people in the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in andean , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have expanded .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , most of the drinking water &apos;s <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of oil has seen sierra intelligence .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this is the entire world coming into a dramatic increase in the whole world .
and the disasters all over the world have increased in a really environmental extent to an unprecedented extent .
so many times in the last 30 years , as many in the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 by co2 , 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific , from the american continent of the indian <unk> , where there are a dramatic decrease of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the other biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have been eliminate the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
for christmas , at christmas , home in tennessee , one billion tons of <unk> .
they saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this happened about christmas .
one of the commercials on christmas side of christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy kid .
it &apos;s in skin and <unk> in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> becomes every day clean .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in income and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear one . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , who don &apos;t know what they talk about .
so the alliance of climate protection has called two campaigns .
this is one , part of you .
we see in the climate crisis as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it up to the supreme court , a lot of <unk> to put a <unk> on the way to bring the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells more good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let them leave it .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that these all connects to this is our dependence on the dirty fuels like dirty coal and inadequate oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this familiar position .
<unk> america , with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work to make us safer and help us to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america &apos;s new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways of the fastest ways of <unk> , dirty fuels , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good jobs .
<unk> america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come out , go together . &quot;
we need to get far and fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask them to be <unk> when they were playing with <unk> .
as they realized how to reach out the hands of reaching it and <unk> , it &apos;s going to be able to learn to think , to think , to understand and understand the problems of understanding the things and changing information .
spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i began to be wondering : what if we can use computers , which is going to be able to take the computer , which is going to be able to take and take data and do it physically , and they could take the data , and they could start to take data , how we want to do it ?
this question was so emotional that we decided to study the answer and evolved <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with the hand , you can see each other , they can see each other , and they have a screen and a <unk> .
much more importantly , you &apos;re physically why you &apos;re just putting them out of the reach of your hands and access to access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> the manipulation of <unk> data .
and if these tools are really going to become physical , and an awareness for their movements , you see each other , and see the subtleties of our reputation with you , then we can begin to start with exploration and more entertaining systems .
i &apos;ll start with a few simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i go into a direction , the video &apos;s going to play forward , and if i go into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , you make your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and tilt .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply a common gestures on data , like it &apos;s how you do this with liquids .
in this case , we &apos;ve got three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they get together .
so if we overdo it , we can do a little bit of <unk> .
there &apos;s also some nice ways in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the ability to give people the possibility of fast trial and we want to see the results immediately .
so here i am -- this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m doing with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of round of <unk> , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re trying to form words , this is tested by a dictionary .
then , after 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to go back , and you have a new <unk> and a try .
thank you .
these are a few kids on a media lab , and i could move them to try to try it to try it and put a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest <unk> at the bottom right .
and it turns out that he wanted to take the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive version .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the <unk> from the table , which shows this character .
it &apos;s going to rise the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he puts a tractor in the scene .
orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by the <unk> shaking , shaking the <unk> , he can interact the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story open , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
so the last example , i have time today to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , as <unk> , <unk> .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes in the sequence that you can organize into any patterns .
and you put them up by just by putting a <unk> in a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a certain clay and tends to be hiring .
and then even more effective effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at a look .
we start in which we &apos;re going to begin to put the <unk> in two rooms and put this up in a series of <unk> , and then add a little more on the voice .
now i add a bass now .
now i &apos;m going to do something on this .
and now i put the filters with the drums so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , by putting the pace in one or other direction .
and i &apos;m going to hook up the filter , with a little more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
so , i don &apos;t have to do it in advance , but i can improvise ; they cut down in reducing the time .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by looking out to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is , my desire to develop new <unk> , the better way to fit our brains and bodies .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the verge of <unk> to this new generation of <unk> , to the digital media , to bring information into our world to get our demands .
thank you .
and i &apos;m excited to all of them .
yeah , good afternoon .
and i &apos;m very excited .
yeah , so , what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back to it , and it &apos;s <unk> at the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and research now for a few years ago , and i &apos;ve been starting to know that , because i just wanted to know , because i wanted to know what i wanted to do in college studies in studies .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so it was curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter .
i think the molecular biology is now , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is extremely important , now extremely important , is going to be much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants on the ground .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> , which is trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
now , under then , there &apos;s things that are all in everyday life , which is what most people are not aware of , for example , the most people who allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue on the endlessly .
and so from interest in this technology , in this technology , i &apos;m just moving on .
so what is <unk> now ?
most of you know most people , most people know that from the <unk> .
and <unk> computers , and then it &apos;s always like that , yes , the hacker break down somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t mean that what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually started , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and they have the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about that with a playful , creative , original things to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be a social problem , which is a <unk> thing like things like things like things like things like things like things like things , and how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s been linked to software , but it &apos;s also in the <unk> , but there &apos;s also a whole thing that there &apos;s a whole <unk> that can make all kinds of different things .
and now stop in biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , because it &apos;s real , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also program it , and so i find it incredibly fascinating , and i find it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
and this actually has just been <unk> eight , these are these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , which is now members or active people everywhere in the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and they &apos;re working with scientists and ask questions with scientists and ask questions and ask questions and ask questions and ask questions and say , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about to find this <unk> access to make a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from <unk> a network , which is actually more like a forum where you &apos;re discussing and discussing the online online .
they &apos;re a little technical sequence and also a little bit of <unk> on the way , and then they &apos;re asking questions .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular thing , had this kind of scene that i &apos;d like to give a little bit about .
here in the image on the upper left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , nonprofit , a private school , nonprofit institution , where everybody can be .
kids , old , all sorts of people , all kinds of people are going to go through it , and they &apos;ve made a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> .
here &apos;s a group at the bottom left in indonesia , which is called the ones that there &apos;s a long time .
more than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also living in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and combine it in quite a very different way .
a group of ankara , which i met a while ago , which i &apos;ve met a while ago , they &apos;d like to teach the public , which is what they &apos;d like to teach the public , what they &apos;re learning in college , and they were trying to explain to people who &apos;s <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got up on the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the <unk> museum in a combination of an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing what they &apos;re all united up , this fascination is the technology .
and what you can do with that and also , in addition to society and ask , so , okay , so , okay , what do you want to get on , do your interest to do that to bring it into this ?
so , <unk> , to hacking biology now , you need some material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you need also tools , and it &apos;s then a lab .
or what you normally understand under a lab , these are kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , very expensive , only for <unk> , trained , trained , trained and so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do it .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each of each of each time has any <unk> technology , as most <unk> , that &apos;s really that .
and it said , with that premise , for example brian <unk> , for example brian <unk> in england , and then it took a <unk> <unk> , and then , it &apos;s so <unk> , and it &apos;s so <unk> , and then has been bred bacteria .
so everybody who has a soup of a soup that he has left too long , also done .
i &apos;m trying to try to try to try and take a little bit in my lab back to a little bit , and then i &apos;d bought a little bit of <unk> on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , and i did a little <unk> analysis , so as well as <unk> <unk> , to go home .
it should actually be a joke now , but it &apos;s going to be .
here in the picture , you see this in the lab , in <unk> , so , in <unk> , so it &apos;s like a <unk> garage , which has been in the university of the college , which has been a group in paris , which has been making it and pretty successful things , and i &apos;m doing quite interesting things , and i &apos;m also going to get a project for a little bit .
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned <unk> , this one kind of <unk> basically for molecular biology .
and yeah , yeah , you can see it &apos;s relatively complicated , so that &apos;s a relatively <unk> , so there &apos;s a lot of people who do that home alone , to a lot of organizations , which is more likely to do in <unk> form in <unk> form .
but always always the approach that it &apos;s going to be easy and to be available .
the first project that we &apos;ve made as international group , when we &apos;re sort of aware of our self , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all familiar with the people who always chatting out there and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founders of the founders , and he said , we &apos;ve got to make a real meeting , and then there are two events , one in london , <unk> 10 , <unk> 10 , and shortly on it in san francisco .
and , there &apos;s also what it went , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our goal , what &apos;s our benefits , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> shot .
and that was pretty intuitive , so everybody has so intuitive , and everybody &apos;s got so his wishes , his and what it does .
so , i think , i think , a very good code .
and then we have it that &apos;s not compulsory , but that &apos;s what i think has been pretty well on , and that &apos;s what people are quite convinced from this .
and then we actually tried to do that into the academic world , but it &apos;s not a way to get there .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , even one step further than the academic world .
yes , what do we do for projects now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we wanted to make an optical event or optical <unk> morality .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , in a room , you can capture little particles in the air , or in the fluid and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s going to be captured there , so it &apos;s just like a <unk> in principle .
and this really works , that &apos;s going to work in the academic sciences , and we thought , we &apos;ve been taking a webcam , and then we took a webcam , the lens <unk> , then you have a microscope , it &apos;s going to get a microscope , which is about <unk> .
you see that down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> <unk> <unk> and then trying to focus on the camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot of things .
so another project that was from the french group , which has worked on paris , which is pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he has so much like this , so a little bit like this kind of <unk> , like something like this , so he &apos;s busy working with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet of this helmet , and he built in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors in the room could go in the room , sit on this chair , on the helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or as they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty sophisticated project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is that the <unk> , this is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , reproduce , <unk> , fragments , reproduce , so you can make it visible .
so , when i do that the <unk> scene at the scene , then they go to collect any <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to go to this method , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair is about that people , this man , like this .
and the machines that make something like this , which is quite expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest to go at <unk> euros .
and it &apos;s not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they have so two two of these two <unk> varieties and said , <unk> , that we make simple and cheaper hardware , which is free hardware , and it &apos;s more open hardware , which is <unk> , and then they &apos;ve got that <unk> , and now that &apos;s the cheapest vendor of these devices worldwide .
i think that six hundred dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s clear .
so it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i &apos;ve started to build was building a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about that far , two centimeters or this .
you invites <unk> on <unk> , and the <unk> then in these <unk> , and then i put them on a <unk> and then put it up with it .
so the device that you can see , it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , which was a pretty wild thing , so on a branch , so on a branch of electronics on it and pressure , and that was the pressure that was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> and put it on it .
a <unk> , if you have a full power with water , which is enough pressure , so i think , so 40 to a <unk> bar about it .
and then you can speed the particles strong enough , and then they go into onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something like this in the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , it &apos;s also a moment that this is the <unk> of the scene of the scene of the scene , and that availability of technology , also increase the information and more importantly , that more people can get together .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also no chance to make it really well .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing , as if you did it ourselves .
and i think technology becomes more important in our modern societies .
and if you &apos;re also able to make meaningful health decisions in society , you can want to make meaningful decisions in society , then you need access to knowledge and the technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and this is the <unk> open <unk> <unk> and citizen science .
so that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get through these scientific technologies .
and this is this <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that you are in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are less people in there than actually exist .
so i know some that didn &apos;t find themselves .
and these are just the <unk> , individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , and put these places together .
and that &apos;s the beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , there was the <unk> in berlin , the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> all over the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to spread into the same way , and then they &apos;re also very easily connected , so that they can be involved in it .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it and even again .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy and enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that is very moving to me as designer designer , but also in the realm of <unk> , and in front of all things in the field of the things in the world .
it &apos;s about how to look at people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media , so you can create these interactive media and create a more <unk> experience .
because i think the interactive media in us <unk> cognitive models , so the paradigm that &apos;s <unk> in our biological memory , so that was programmed in our biological memory , a very long time ago , and that we can cause them through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> that you &apos;ve seen in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that the future is right at us , in our <unk> roots .
so , what are <unk> models ?
so i wrote up four notes and i &apos;d like to explain to a moment .
<unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial age .
to these <unk> models , that we &apos;ve heard a genetically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go to the same time , and i &apos;m going to show you about trial that you also have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to talk to these <unk> models , very , very , very , very , very , in the way we use a language of language .
and the third area , which explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> in definition , which involves the denial of the linearity , and what of course tells us that we feel the linearity today .
the fourth point is that history is a place for us .
now , what about the virtuality is the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that .
how many doors is the house where you live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to spontaneously answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and this is what happens at the moment .
they &apos;re going to go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re bending the reality , and it &apos;s no computer .
fantastic , right ?
and so , for example , we &apos;re struggling to provide the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we actually can actually do it all the time .
and this wealth of this wealth of the reality of the reality of the reality that people have used people in the pre-industrial time , because they didn &apos;t need anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have media media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was remembered .
in this head , knowledge <unk> , and with these virtual images , the imagination , was passed on , also passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s actually rooted in us that we can deal with the virtuality .
what &apos;s interesting about this is when i can do a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that time of human beings was <unk> and medium and medium itself .
now , if you keep thinking a bit further .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll get to talk to that again .
in the most important tool of <unk> have been around the story .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were extra stopped to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re very , very much , very high stories .
by the author of the book the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , is the <unk> , that we still have <unk> hours every year with stories of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s going to reach it to reach the most of the most of the time of life , most of the time of stories has spent a lot of stories .
now we think our love to stories is that we sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
that &apos;s going to go back to the cultures of the pre-industrial time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive media as a particularly impressive is that we have based on our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe , of the <unk> tribe .
and the life lived in the coast of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you somehow navigate , from island , from island , to get food .
and they made this with so-called <unk> .
you might know that if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians in the australian nation .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they &apos;ve used them to use the <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the navigation could be photographed by songs .
which was the language of the language of <unk> stature .
that means you &apos;re <unk> on sound and about rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm have shown the geology to put these songs and it , of course , that we could make these songs , and of course , they could put these songs and look like that on the left , to the left , and then back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing , but why don &apos;t we sing from a to b ?
anyway , in order to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
this is what happened is this <unk> age .
we &apos;ve moved before this called <unk> .
it &apos;s happened to the age machine , and it is the book , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve shifted the responsibility for our memories and their own production of individual memories on the external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve got god to <unk> a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> of the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , and so on what we &apos;re going to call mass mass media , and so on what we call mass mass media today , that these mass mass of our memories have been blocked , and our ability to <unk> our capacity .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
the <unk> to the age age .
what has an impact on our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the <unk> influences the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be in the course of the centuries of the centuries and more <unk> through the forces of the <unk> .
that means instead of remembering ourselves individually , we &apos;ve been standardized , very common , distributed patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more themselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing more in images that things don &apos;t have things in images , but we don &apos;t do it .
and we &apos;ve used to have things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like <unk> .
and what &apos;s left us is <unk> .
still , we &apos;re still being arrested as <unk> as <unk> .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , and we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> that will bring us to discover these ways to discover our skills again .
there is about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain that a little bit .
there are technical concepts like an example of reality , reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then this is a concept of what the physical world makes us combine the virtual world to combine the virtual world , the virtual world is going to be virtual to the virtual order to feel the natural power .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , that , of course , that sound may sound , we &apos;re going to make us physically , physically , virtual worlds , virtual worlds , very model of the <unk> .
and another example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
all that needs the ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i have in the degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are here today .
you might just get up at a short time , so you can go back to the two of the project .
and this project i brought in as an example , like again , that <unk> of cognitive models will be addressed .
all the one is a game , i have to say .
what the <unk> of course <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you have very likely to be in front of the eyes that any people have people with some <unk> or that you &apos;re playing with some kind of <unk> in the hand .
anyway , they do it in it .
this is a game for outside .
and so this is specifically thinking that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects to the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce , the real world .
so i apologize to me that i have to <unk> so much .
you can tell you a lot better , there &apos;s more much more behind it .
it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get from the city from the city a whole different sight , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get such a different way , virtual world , in a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this is the virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a sense , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , i &apos;d like to sum up my my talk , in the sense that the features that we have acquired from the world &apos;s <unk> , and the skills that we have acquired with the aid of the world &apos;s <unk> , and that we have a little bit of <unk> , technological , new products , actually not in the future , but we actually go back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be very much for you .
i just had been asked if the bag there is a <unk> bag , and i instead of talking about it .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m going to really resolve all the same thing in it .
but i just do it just curious .
yes , kids are from nature from curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m out of the house of house , so i &apos;m looking at the subject of the curiosity , and how it was changing the curiosity , and why we &apos;re also going to lose curiosity , and why we &apos;re not new , and we &apos;re new <unk> and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re concerned with as a creator of a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in both n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half a year .
a <unk> of natural user interface to the subject of the design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why start with such natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , and and etc . and and so forth .
and there &apos;s just one of these little devices , because the things should be intuitive , because the things are getting more intuitive , and there you have to be more natural , and there you have to look at what &apos;s really for us , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve been able to interface in the realm of design , so the next generation in the world &apos;s relationship in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship with how our tools or how the computer <unk> <unk> to digital assistant .
so i got involved with that , when is what , of course , or intuitive .
maybe even a look at it again .
why does it happen at all ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here shortly , we &apos;re going to move from the third one in the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
the beginning of the <unk> through the language .
this means , you found that you &apos;ve been able to communicate a common language , you could communicate with each other , it &apos;s been able to communicate in the same cave , and in other areas , and in other areas , and has created as <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , a very living .
in fact , you had to learn , so no toddler can be able to talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it and ok .
this was then overtaken by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , which is what <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to start it in stone , and i &apos;m going to leave it .
depending on how i <unk> , and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a whole different narrative when there &apos;s a living in life .
but then <unk> then moved to this script as a <unk> , went .
and then the next generation , where we actually actually live primarily .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was the same thing that was the <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other people said , you &apos;re really amazing when the people start to read , and then , of course , you want to join , and it &apos;s of course <unk> .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting one , so a <unk> is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at this in this particular process of phase that we get involved .
and of course , this is confused , because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on and so on .
with complete transparency , what the new thinking is , which is what the new thinking does on the old mind , don &apos;t say that in the ancient <unk> , don &apos;t tell more beef , or other phenomena , which is a little bit more , and that &apos;s what i just want to go back and want to do it .
and the two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing about this is when you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but it &apos;s not more at the local level , it &apos;s on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global global .
not , if i think of locally and the neighbor thinks less organic , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this means , from local village , is actually a global village , so , of course , most of course , so intuitive , so , of course , the most transparency .
so as you knew in the village at the time , who has what and when , this is what this extension is about this expansion of the self through this <unk> of <unk> on a global level .
it &apos;s that we have to know global and faster and better .
as it used to look at the village in the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;m just going to look at the way , which is what it is , in fact , what we might have , of course , what we might have , of course , what we might have to do , what &apos;s what we may have , what is what makes the difference ?
because often people are going to be able to do it , they can &apos;t do it , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , which is not just easy to change that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and , of course , , of course , something is intuitive , and how can i take influence , and the way that things are so intuitive to the things that you &apos;re a <unk> , so the same way , as intuitive , because they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re easy to use .
so you &apos;re doing it , even as a student , with the theme of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what you start , of course , where you start and look like this and says , okay , i just look at the inner self .
and what does it actually look out there ?
so how do we work when we do it ?
and what does mean , of course , is , of course , intuitively , and how are our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs has said , you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it to <unk> it .
so you really have to see in detail , if i want to take a little bit of <unk> or intuitive , what means that &apos;s in the core .
and this is what you can see that a our seven senses , most of us think we &apos;ve got seven , in fact , in the near future , it &apos;s probably the next future , the next future , and as an extension , again , our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
say alone , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of using the word , don &apos;t know what it means to take your detail .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , when it gets information to information , when you know information , and from information , knowing , knowing how i can also intuitive , or of course , could be intuitive .
and of course , how design creates influence on perception .
and we see this when i do things , then i can design them like on the right , like i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make you kind of intuitive , by making things .
so a lot of natural , in a gourd , but i can sort of look directly , where &apos;s salt and pepper and pepper inside .
and when i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , he &apos;s going to start thinking about where it &apos;s in .
and the left , just access to the left , and i hope i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in there that &apos;s salt .
but also our perception itself , how you &apos;re going to fool us .
for example , this perception of the context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same height , and yet , our perceptions , depending on what the context we do .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
and there &apos;s no way to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to connect or associate it .
and if i &apos;m going to stop a <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t see just a unit , which is just a unit , and yet , we see one unit , and we don &apos;t see one of three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
this is what you &apos;re called <unk> or just <unk> , which also affects ourselves in perception .
so important for the creator for the creator , they &apos;re in the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> that &apos;s a little bit close to the continuity and so on .
often , in the third then , again .
but this is essential to the essential part , if you just want to restore things too well .
so the next phenomenon , which is very interesting as that &apos;s very interesting .
it looks very banal , is very exciting , but if you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes in front of the eyes , and now we think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back from the back .
because it &apos;s an assumption that you can see something that you can see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re just going to see our <unk> , before we see it , back back to the back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got the cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also there , it &apos;s coming back .
and then it goes back to the front of the time , because it doesn &apos;t go back to the back of the front , and i &apos;m not going to look at it again and sure if what you see , it &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back back to the back and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how certain things going on , and what they do is to happen to these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s the picture of you .
there is exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everyone is trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s what you see .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw this , that it &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know that .
they &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on all , you &apos;ve always seen it .
that &apos;s , i actually spoiled it in the way that you don &apos;t see any patterns that you don &apos;t see any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short time , again , again , the dog in this <unk> image .
and that &apos;s these projection of vision , <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do it , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray is not , you actually don &apos;t , but here , in these <unk> mass is just going on .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i sort of , in the present , i can get very well <unk> , and i can get very well <unk> in which i &apos;ve been involved in three seconds .
it doesn &apos;t have to process it as the present .
and then it moves in the past , and so i can bridge a very elegant model of the computer , as i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also a completely interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fell in love .
this means , if you know that , you know , you know , who you look at how long look at how long , because i don &apos;t pick up a <unk> for what can happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a completely interesting phenomenon .
this is the most of the perceptions that we have .
this is , this first idea is going to happen in a rapid speed , how we perceive things .
and as we see things that we look at what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about this .
of course , the creator of the subject are not only with the theme of perceptions and neural equipment , but mainly , of course , with the issue of <unk> .
so , like a human thing is a lot accordingly .
so there are more practical functions , so there &apos;s such smart aspects or other things or other things .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where i really do .
now , there are symbolic functions , why does someone have a little bit like this little bit of <unk> , where hardly do anything like anything else , and even though it isn &apos;t so practical , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
we &apos;re more likely to go on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we have , of course , as a creator of course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the subject , of course , which is <unk> .
<unk> means how to get to a certain goal , or how to get a certain goal , or how to get a user in a particular environment to be effective , efficient and regulations .
so , it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i do something more relevant ?
i can use that directly manual , or i need the n of this , i &apos;m given the training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i just make that different and make beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , and look at this , you &apos;re going to understand why <unk> percent of our software is very intuitive or not to be able to use it , which is very intuitive , including <unk> , including <unk> , including it as much more intuitive than the classical software .
and it &apos;s not only intuitive to the apple model , not only since apple &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if i just wanted to harness technology devices of people to harness .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re using through this new way of <unk> , and for example five times , for example five times more faster , on average , on average .
and you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic <unk> , five hours of doing five hours , and you just need this new kind of one of the natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home for four hours , but your employers , or someone &apos;s going to take your employers , or someone &apos;s looking at them with the four hours .
but i want to say , of course , that , of course , it &apos;s a corresponding thing for us to do , but of certain things .
when we go back to the software , this is so the first <unk> line of <unk> , which were very abstract , where you &apos;ve took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that came up now with a <unk> model or mental model of the software as the software is saying , which is a idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computers .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor is a metaphor .
this was a lot of <unk> , but , of course , it &apos;s still much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m designing as a creator , which is a lot more common , when it looks .
and this is also a paradigm shift .
that i think that this is always <unk> for the success , just <unk> a app .
and if i go to this one step into this natural <unk> interfaces , where i &apos;m in voice , by language , by a language , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> and cursor to drive things , then i &apos;m going to drive things faster and still on .
so , that &apos;s also going to take me back to the point , when are the things going to actually more intuitive ?
and if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend here , and see , what does that mean from the view of the view , when is really something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s what people are also intuitive to us , when i just have to think about it .
so it seems to seem to be thinking , but it seems to be reasonably simple .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is more intuitive .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that &apos;s when we look at that we can use existing pathways from something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use that as a creator .
that means i can just transmit an intuitive , human <unk> on a software , so that makes the software to make the software .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most important thing that we have , and now i &apos;ve been telling .
this is the so-called <unk> .
it &apos;s using each of us and <unk> is an acronym and they &apos;re for orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
it does all of you all the time , but it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s subconscious , and it &apos;s actually instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world in the world and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without all the time that most people knew the model is there .
<unk> <unk> , about 50 to 50 to a half of us , so in their sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be less often more often than a day .
now , i can just have this mental protected , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar like with the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than that the transmission of the classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to <unk> this , for example , i &apos;m <unk> as a maker of <unk> , <unk> as a <unk> , i can look at it in the detail , and i can see it somewhere , i can go somewhere or send somebody or send somebody or a way to go to somebody or so on .
and then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
she has already eaten pies .
so here , i use that with the object , again , with the object , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of this , can now filter this , and you can say , show me all the thing with chocolate .
and in a time , it has a interface , which is much more intuitive and very much natural .
because that i can reach things like the pieces of the bits , and it can come to me , is significantly natural than if they were about <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms or other mechanisms or other mechanisms or other mechanisms .
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to be able to think of a <unk> , and designers have to think differently , and in this sense , thank you very much , i &apos;m pretty much welcome to your attention and please .
i want to leverage you to a very certain aspect of curiosity .
the first thing , if you become a child as a child , as a baby , is that you want you to play , right ? and depending on whether their parents allowed you to play more or less , the more , the more , the more , the more , so , of course , will be dressed in their curiosity .
and curiosity is not learning .
so , all of those who are here are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk to me now , basically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give you + and two grams of phosphorus , and you have to take two grams of phosphorus , and you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide by <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we can &apos;t take phosphorus phosphorus and make it .
so , it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re doing something about what &apos;s a <unk> thing , but not this .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
this is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and now it &apos;s now going to be a lot more uranium in the world , in the world , in all the world , being used in all the world .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium are distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia of children .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , it only takes three times than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
so if we think of this way of <unk> to <unk> , and then our entire earth will go to the way , or later it &apos;s a <unk> .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re thinking about the <unk> for <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the war .
in the moment , we &apos;re building corn and 30 kilogram per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare , or <unk> <unk> .
that means that we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than fresh .
and we can look at the problem in the first point .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , 20 percent of the <unk> has <unk> <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , the <unk> are going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby is about six thousand <unk> .
we could reduce that about 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
this is one of the evidence that men are no pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be coming up with the <unk> parts of this .
people are about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you do the people when you exist in the people , if you say that &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you say , when you get a lifetime , you know the earth .
here it says , the more you are <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then you weigh about four times more than us .
i could take termites , but in the united states , no one may be termites in the united states , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we and because they &apos;re only in three to six months , you can live in your weight in your energy consumption , over the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to be able to do , and what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re going to see on the earth , you can see that , for example , a program has a program , you want to be <unk> here , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to dumber as a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees alone .
you &apos;ve heard about this kind of <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to stand dumber than you .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , they don &apos;t allow <unk> agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> .
every year , we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that would have to go back into the loops .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
this means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they &apos;re all called the name that allow us to go back .
isn &apos;t this sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s secure , it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is more effective .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to be a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can just have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can different .
we can regain our nutrients .
we do in brazil in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
in fact , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to go directly .
in china , a healthcare system is still <unk> , like , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to <unk> our nutrients .
this is , the whole western age draws by that the city always has taken , but the farmers never have been a bit back .
so by using the cities , the cities had to grow more because the farmers were going to cities , and they always had to get their nutrients .
so that &apos;s why all of the rich rich are expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to do civilization over five years , because you always was able to be able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you invited to dinner in china , you &apos;re expecting to stay for as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how to get the nutrients back .
and that &apos;s really beautiful , when you do that , so agriculture generates , in a hectare of land , with five thousand people in the favelas , can be able to produce a farmer with five thousand people and pig , and they &apos;re going to grow <unk> and pig , ducks and ducks and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas to go back about 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people who are less bad .
we can support them to be good .
it &apos;s <unk> , of course , but the facilities are carrying itself .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so through the design that they can easily operate .
that means that &apos;s going to go back .
and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities ever got <unk> .
they could just put a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then it would be ruined for years of years .
not happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people to be less bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need phosphorus to be phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , they &apos;re writing in germany to the way plants in the treatment plants that are in <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can get a little bit at a little bit .
because the <unk> plant could be best to get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
and we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see that it &apos;s not happening .
we &apos;ve used us over three years .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need this overall .
understand , you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world .
so opec is a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace by other energy .
but the phosphorus will not replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mostly to ask , what is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , because in holland is the land on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you have them <unk> , and they come with 50 &apos;s roses .
completely inefficient .
but completely effective , right ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , is about six <unk> <unk> of their life .
this .
this is not exactly exactly exactly accurate because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> will do .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but all effective , yes ?
a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and to burn it to <unk> , and to lose it to the whole materials to lose all kinds of materials , but at first , how do you make these cycles ?
imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
yes ?
and when i go to dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with <unk> and a glass of water on that .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about avoiding it .
all the <unk> .
we say people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green green in the south .
no , that &apos;s right , right ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , from , yes , you &apos;re going to make it back .
but the wrong things .
if you get the wrong stuff , you have a <unk> .
as we think of the north .
this is where everyone is <unk> .
when they walk , everybody destroys the footprint the ground .
because the floor is going to die from the mosses , and the wind and the water is washing the ground away .
if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means that the way the water is that the water remains in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a marsh .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , avoiding , avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , as the people in the high bow , i can kick out of the <unk> of the car .
because you know , it &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , for example , it &apos;s a liquid .
they can get them up where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they contribute through the throw biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , there are two cycles .
it &apos;s not to be <unk> .
a television machine or a washing machine , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things , the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they need to be so much to go in biological systems .
the things that are only being used in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
and the direct ads , not for the company <unk> per se in <unk> , but for that , you &apos;re going to help this company to make these products to succeed .
because we don &apos;t make things more freely from it .
yes ?
so , if i put them down to food and say , this is free from <unk> , you don &apos;t help you all .
no , we lay out what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can get to the <unk> of the <unk> , and you can walk the rubber system in biological circuits , yes ?
all of them is <unk> .
and if we succeed , of course , it &apos;s what we do for the nike , for nike and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and this is half of all the world parts in the world that causes the textile industry .
so that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help you ask people .
hey , <unk> , power are you really serious ?
because it has already changed the space twice .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
this is what just been shown .
this is going .
so we can do the things so that they do , if they &apos;re <unk> , when they &apos;re <unk> , they can use biological cycles .
technical cycles is the same .
it &apos;s a direct <unk> .
it &apos;s the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done in the circulation .
that &apos;s also , in every store , you can push things out .
if you come up , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
when it &apos;s the waste .
it &apos;s the <unk> rum , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the front of the <unk> , but otherwise in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , you can go back to <unk> , you can go back to a baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia , <unk> trees .
yes ?
only if you take these <unk> , you take the <unk> , sterile and the powder to plant trees .
so the baby &apos;s <unk> for all the life , at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> ; we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i started to set up an institute .
now , a lot of people are working there , and they &apos;re all engaged in them .
there &apos;s extra a club , <unk> , where everyone is involved .
so no longer save , avoid , avoid , not <unk> , but smart waste .
do you do the curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a <unk> , as a <unk> , in the english <unk> , understand .
<unk> are translator heard the written notes in <unk> music .
that you &apos;re not just sending out as a word of the text into a other language in a other language , but also to understand the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , to understand it &apos;s a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do it with <unk> .
translate from the germans to translate in english , can require more knowledge because if you go to poetry or even poetry .
<unk> is <unk> for <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just got the written of the written notes .
you think that the composer in the grades is exactly what he has thought about there .
in fact , notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about the same or <unk> , like a verbal , very seemingly <unk> accurate description of a landscape .
because in this case , the smell is the smell of the flowers , the smell of the flowers don &apos;t have to see , the degree of the <unk> , not to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
that means the interpreter of this <unk> set of this <unk> data into another , which is <unk> , non-verbal <unk> .
today , i want to do what i want to translate musical , so <unk> , even once into a verbal language .
so there &apos;s a translation of translation .
so , i prefer to do the whole thing about german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be true for me to the equivalent of translation of translation .
so that music works as much as the spoken language for me .
the <unk> notes have the function of the title of writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be able to learn to learn notes and make keys on the piano or press the right place on the piano .
namely , these are just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
you can see the letter of letters you can see when you can do the language .
so , you need to take for the process of music at least as long as the spoken language for the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you &apos;re learning to be passive , you know , you know , you understand , or you can also talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like a <unk> .
after you &apos;ve chosen a piece of a piece , because you &apos;ve chosen a piece of it , you &apos;re going to take you in all the point of backgrounds , the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thought of composers .
you studied the works that he created before and after .
you compare .
the <unk> to write it .
how did he feel ?
how were the circumstances of the society and politics and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in .
you think in this time , by looking at this time , looking at literature or reading literature .
but the time you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge for the composers of the composer that you play more than a lot of times , and it &apos;s always easier to be easier to feel inside it .
the composer gets more to my friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more to my personal cause to play it .
so there &apos;s all other notes in the cause of composers of composers , but it &apos;s just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make sense and meaning to sense .
and i &apos;m going to say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these notes could be .
now for me , and for the composers of the composer , and what you could mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of making a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from my own personally .
it has to be for me in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience , i can &apos;t convince my audience to do that .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have to have the experience , that i &apos;ve been able to experience as a long way of experience how new .
how to rethink a happy new day , even though always with the same rituals of life , up with the same rituals , your breakfast , go to work , so as well , i have the same piece back to the new .
i &apos;ve become a day older that seasons will shift seasons , and on the morning , when the morning , it takes longer , it takes longer to go back to the sound .
i &apos;m going to take the audience , you know , you know , or unconsciously .
all that influenced me , and all this influenced my experience with the composition of the composition .
absolutely wonderful is when i &apos;m standing on the stage on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in , and we &apos;ll get this answers to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because the things that we don &apos;t have <unk> , and you can &apos;t have samples .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you have to have the audience , like the music communicates alive .
that &apos;s a concert of another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to go to my palette of <unk> , on emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but then new <unk> .
there &apos;s a nice concrete example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and vision professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , and i was very early with 13 years old , and so i was at my high school in his school classes .
and i was 17 , when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last one of the four movies by chopin , a <unk> .
and he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my school classes , i said , expectation .
so he did and he said , so ?
it has to be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but they &apos;re not meaningful memories .
i play this piece of years today , and i &apos;ve always gone back to me , even though i did not have a grade grade .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of it from a whole different area . monet &apos;s painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he was translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she was at this moment .
his personal <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
now , i was also older as chopin with <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
and he was only living for five years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look at notes , even though i mean , you can memorize them .
to keep <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially if he died .
now how do you start talking to speak the language of music ?
i said , yes , you need to do about the same way that spoken language .
a lot of times , the <unk> is that you just learn the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to learn that before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the sound on the instrument .
and if all the fingers in time and right like it is moving in the notes , then it comes out of the notes that sound together like music .
so if that &apos;s all happening , the students get the <unk> piece .
they &apos;re not talking about interpretation of interpretation .
all right , there &apos;s a quick piece , this is a fast piece .
<unk> , slowly .
according to and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you .
but even when you put this out , it &apos;s still just a technical level .
and still it &apos;s not always any interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you don &apos;t forget a little bit of <unk> .
which is that to make music on the instrument that can do your musical musical and feel to be there before .
that &apos;s what they sing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn it , because it didn &apos;t have any parents , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have it over another way , so about an instrument to sound .
people who never sing , have never felt immediately with your body , as it is to make a sound .
make a phrase to design a phrase .
because the musical system is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet , to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do it anymore , if it gets bored .
no need to whistle a whistle or sing .
every single music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re constantly going from the outside of music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i didn &apos;t sing ?
that &apos;s the question i can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to figure out whether you can &apos;t do it , or learn , how you can do these little muscles that are <unk> the vocal chords .
that &apos;s where you can train .
or c , because you have <unk> them that they &apos;re <unk> .
so here i ask , how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
they &apos;ve got a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and they don &apos;t want to have a failure to do it .
but what i &apos;m going to do is regret , because music is a nice , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also do it even more .
well , you know , you don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , but you can say , you can tell you whether they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s saying , i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of no food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to avoid classical music , because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to consciously and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is too cute or too sweet .
tell what you feel .
the time they &apos;re going to try and want to get some more spices , or they want to be able to do some more spices , or taste even fine differences .
now , why do i challenge you from my audience that it also listen to this ?
because the music is a language , and a language is communicating .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the food that &apos;s going on by a chef or a chef has to be eaten , and not just to look at them or have shared recipes .
so please hear when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment , where the adults are doing music , or at least active music , you hear a child , a child , a child , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask , to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you actually play you in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds quite different than before .
and that &apos;s the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step of an interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a piece of this right now that &apos;s originally a hundred , <unk> or a hundred hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have <unk> .
and there was no a instrument in the time , it didn &apos;t even have the piano .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had the <unk> possibilities of the modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that bach had had the stream , on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
also from beethoven knows that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time as <unk> .
so the composers of us rely on us <unk> to reinvent the pieces .
and so they &apos;ll be audible by what they just imagined in the spirit .
and also what you would think of today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you could have thought about .
thank you .
do you know what your envy is ?
were they jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend , which drives a <unk> .
if i come to my little v w , and next to me , next to me , comes to this feeling .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do so big ?
you know , that &apos;s the first year , half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford so n small car ?
and then one thing is , it &apos;s going to be unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward sense .
our organism invented a great way to make your uncomfortable emotions as you just get your nose to disappear .
you can also try that with words like revenge or <unk> .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit with this mechanism today or something that you &apos;re unconscious about what you &apos;re going to &apos;re unconscious .
the mechanism is from lying .
but don &apos;t think of the lie , as you may have heard you might have heard when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them .
in a lie , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to test it easy to see that it &apos;s completely different .
he &apos;s just fooling them and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which is what i &apos;m talking about is that they &apos;re fooled .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a self-deception .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> or also get down .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter <unk> once a woman <unk> .
and this woman has afterwards , the portrait would not look like it .
picasso says , wait for it .
it will be more similar .
on this place , and when you laugh , they see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists are very good to tell us .
because artists have a desperate relationship to lie .
the artists share with you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see , if you just look inside the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of a portrait of what you &apos;re just familiar with , if they &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork over again .
then this awkward feeling , it may not be very similar to you , and it &apos;s going to be more similar to them .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to <unk> our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the state of the mythology , in stories , it appeared again .
you might know this idea of the lady who would look at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful to the country ?
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and they also know how much hostility of this real tells us , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true language .
but we should just feel familiar with a woman who can &apos;t say a woman somewhere else .
this is necessary that we need to put out of what we &apos;re using under <unk> <unk> , over again .
we need to have this lie to this lie that we don &apos;t have to do deception without that .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the <unk> , but also in science , but in science , it &apos;s such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
you heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the ancestry of people .
that the person is supposed to be <unk> and , yes , it &apos;s at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said that &apos;s not true what charles there is writing .
the person is supposed to be from monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop that the people know about it .
why do we have to prevent people to learn from something when it is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we <unk> this <unk> , this feeling of being great , <unk> from the highest being , not from such an organism , not from such a organism like an organism that exists , which is like something like a organism , which is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent that people know the people , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slow this mechanism on it , and like the tracks that &apos;s leaving on something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to see you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her a student .
a 16-year-old student .
and they like it special , because it &apos;s a slope for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen .
and because i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> in this place , there &apos;s not true .
i said my wife , always when a person in a moral job is because it &apos;s used because we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
so , do this once , and then you understand the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
i &apos;m interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
there he signed up .
and <unk> , they don &apos;t tell his teacher that you &apos;d like to put fire somewhere , and i &apos;m glad you &apos;d like to get out of <unk> .
no , it &apos;s just a lot better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge of putting the risks that others can only do when they &apos;re just putting fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> on that <unk> , by the <unk> , he knew he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and conscious , which is immediately <unk> , without what you can do about it , and the things that you know is that they can look very different for you , designed much better for you and others .
so just like these words , just like these words that we &apos;re also doing in the language of the political games .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know if we tell that , the social event are very disturbed by the social event .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that works to work .
so i &apos;m going to tell you what we found in my institute .
and after what &apos;s the illusion of this deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than that we actually know in unconscious knowledge that it is valid to spread out .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example is going ahead of what many of you know , and some of them value , very few of them don &apos;t need all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so little more intellectual , which says , like leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not <unk> , <unk> , physical physical physical physical .
and if you have people who have a solid belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have a soul , and you can also say that it &apos;s like the soul of your life , and you can also say that the soul is just from meat , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead , dead .
and from this soul , you think that they sort of in this nature of nature , in that nature of nature , it &apos;s called the <unk> in the latin , which is the <unk> , your mind .
and when this <unk> then <unk> over the people , it &apos;s filled with it , with the spirit , with nature , who can only live , right with the soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as a little sense of what to be present for our lives .
and if you have this assumption , you understand the logic that we &apos;re fortunate to experience this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
now , this is a <unk> which describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something , but also the willingness to lie .
which is to lie that you can simply use this logic wrong .
in this room , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i stuck here in particular .
a third sentence , which is instantly coming up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who has no soul , who &apos;s dead , and you can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the tells the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;re right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the office doesn &apos;t have a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i &apos;ve been right , it &apos;s right .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , it has no soul .
these things are logical .
and now our worst consciousness is immediately able to do it .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the first sentence is already proved and <unk> .
because actually , we have to prove it , whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it simply uses it is that two sentences is correct , and a third thing that looks like that , which looks like it , so we can save our lifestyles .
so , we &apos;re doing that as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live with a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we &apos;ve got a whole modern example of getting back to the <unk> .
and i have to do that another memorable topic , a <unk> of a philosophy of philosophy , present .
this has to do that we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was johannes <unk> and after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which consists of pure nature .
it &apos;s not the soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put that exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack is supposed to go first .
so it &apos;s exactly in the middle .
that &apos;s how we &apos;ve imagined .
<unk> forces solve each other .
it doesn &apos;t happen at all .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately get a haystack bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need reason , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing .
he automatically runs the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in the nature of nature , it &apos;s going to be <unk> from the larger pile , they have a very quickly feeling that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re also in <unk> in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> in brain sciences .
there &apos;s a scholars , which is called the wolf <unk> , and by him , you sometimes say , wolf <unk> said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and you can say , if wolf <unk> is right , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read in the daily newspaper , you can read that in this third sentence .
and it looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and it &apos;s so <unk> .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you &apos;d have to have to have to have to see if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of the work is wrong , as you would have to think of the opposite of course .
and now you can just just do if you want to do anything , if you want to test yourself , and especially when they want people to make people happy to practice the lie .
practice , for example , if you look at a person that you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call you , it would be a little political <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
it &apos;s immediately going to be one , of course , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re engaged with it , they &apos;re not able to prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , it &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy because he &apos;s fooled .
because he led them to a <unk> , that he doesn &apos;t get themselves .
because actually , this person doesn &apos;t care about to prove .
he &apos;s just interested in the need to be interested in the need to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the kind of shift , you experience the magnificence of the lie of the lie .
and when you have a way of having a possibility to feel that <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their own <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
and i &apos;ve been allowed to have asked myself if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and asked me whether i want to give you a talk here and my idea .
i have to be honest , you know , you know , it was hard to talk to me at the beginning of my idea .
and i may be able to imagine that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all of all ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of these are the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that have been made for the bad complexity , because i &apos;ve been able to study engineering engineering to study engineering , engineering school , today , i think i kit , kit .
and then i went to berlin for berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
this is <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but sort of <unk> like &apos; n <unk> , from a hundred watts of coming out of the square square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful that he was grateful that he got the word back again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word , because all the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
there was a way that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you thought it was evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was <unk> and he was made wind and solar power , and i started the <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what i said is i &apos;m told , because many , many , many beautiful statements were that i &apos;ve lived through .
i spent 11 years in the collective years , that was <unk> .
we were twenty people .
if one said no , it was a <unk> , which was a completely <unk> -- i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> thing , i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> thing , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues always have <unk> him , because all the colleagues of my father always have <unk> him , you have the money on your child .
it &apos;s going to be dissolved .
and it was really , very , very <unk> , and you also come in the same phase in the same stage , which i &apos;ve got a picture of a thousand years , where i asked me about 10 years , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the collective of course , , of course , it should really be so cool .
and i &apos;ve got it up to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve become a cofounder of the company , i &apos;ve become <unk> of the company , which was going to get together with the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in the world .
it &apos;s a <unk> , but then we have the problem of a growing enterprise , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , and we put it back and go back to the next topic of the future , and i think it &apos;s going to go back and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and it &apos;s going to go back to the other topic , that &apos;s not the <unk> , that &apos;s not about store .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;ve got to imagine now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where you can use a memory for a memory for a memory .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
now they have a renewables today from fifteen percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you anymore ?
it &apos;s just simply technologically technologically .
when they get more vulnerable to each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell you the politicians , when they put our facility in <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s wrong , but we have seven percent , and our web is physically , european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the fact that the first contacts have started with the island of the island , don &apos;t calculate .
as big , as big to be a battery , so you have to be a battery in 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to keep a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this around the world .
by the way , about a hundred <unk> , about a hundred <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the world .
it &apos;s equivalent to the amount of expensive nuclear power nuclear power , because this is all over .
the world &apos;s <unk> in the world that &apos;s going to be deleted with diesel because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you put this <unk> .
and then it looks like this .
in the time , three of the <unk> , two are always waiting .
yeah , this is the bottom down there is the load .
we also get very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , in fact , is a <unk> system or a system , which is just a system that can be <unk> in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel is <unk> , and the wind , sun controls the burden so that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables a year , so energy a year , not the performance of the moment , then you have to turn the petrol off the petrol .
that is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can actually take the whole web .
and of course , it &apos;s only if you &apos;re going to have an staff system in any way .
this has no one in the world .
that &apos;s the little style of style , so you can also be able to use your <unk> on a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do in <unk> ?
this is already happening .
but if you want to get multiple of these <unk> <unk> , and they want to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to be on 70 to 90 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing it from batteries .
that &apos;s going to be a energy energy , which then is hydrogen , methane , methane , power to gas or <unk> , that will be it .
they have to go to a <unk> and not just balance and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s like to know what &apos;s a normal , devastating <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have a whole bunch of simulations .
and they have wind and the sun and the load of load , and they came to the outcome , a very interesting result , that you have a middle of about 50 cents a <unk> a <unk> <unk> per <unk> per <unk> <unk> , about <unk> cents .
and this was the very first computations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the <unk> five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what to be done ?
have entered investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
so we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s a picture .
the brown is the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has an opportunity to be able to do it , because we &apos;re still 20 percent of diesel , and we don &apos;t even <unk> the other things in the other stuff .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the island , has meant that we &apos;re very great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t think that you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build an hall in berlin , where we sort of <unk> the electric narrative of the island of the area in the scale .
that means we were looking for finding the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
they come from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s at the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s , and today , <unk> , and then became <unk> on the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it &apos;s got a megawatts of power , and it can take this performance for six hours to do this performance , and this is the battery that we have <unk> <unk> .
and then they put up .
and we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he sits there in the hall , in fact , this whole dynamic behavior of this web , so it looks like this , this is the big dynamic behavior of this web , so this is the big battery , here &apos;s the big battery , where we simulate the web .
we do this over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of mapping the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we also can get <unk> kilowatts on the web .
this is what we see here again , again , the diesel , again , all the one of them <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done has been done since <unk> , the hall then finished , until today , most of the one system of electronics in electronics , to create software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject and the issue , and everything in between .
you have to go to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the net , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is about the theme that you &apos;re in this island , basically , it &apos;s all the most important thing that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going back to the moment and <unk> , <unk> , how to go , in the island , we have to go to <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
and then <unk> offers <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate <unk> in the island , <unk> , you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> by <unk> , you can use bed nets , yes , you should do it in any case , but you will never get rid of memory completely .
and that &apos;s like the message .
so many people come and look at that , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the diesel , you don &apos;t have any more the spinning mass that causes a certain inertia on the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically taken by rotating masses of <unk> masses where the wave is everywhere around the wave around europe .
we look at this web , you see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine hertz , we start a couple of <unk> <unk> , we start a couple of <unk> <unk> , and again , a little bit of <unk> .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly rough .
if you go somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have it anymore , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can have two milliseconds of two milliseconds .
and then you see , you see the enormous ones there .
and the message is now , we need to get into this rotating masses , if we &apos;re sort of at 20 , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on if we want to do that at all .
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simple , the power station is going to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a moment of <unk> in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t want to , or <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t go .
and we &apos;re just trying to try to tell you that you can break the capacity that can degrade the capacity , they can degrade by electrochemical memory into the net .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and to this purpose , people are going to come and look at our <unk> at the way , and we &apos;re looking at our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can do a piece of a long future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had over the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not utter , rotten , <unk> , we &apos;ve never described everything .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to be able to store the same capacity in the next 30 years in the next 30 years .
simple , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve sort of experienced in the last two years , that the scientists are asking to my side .
we have been able to get over 10 million <unk> , also , a german grid now at the german web .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so , of course , you also realize that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s only from this <unk> , to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so i &apos;ve always been trying in arguments , these <unk> , they &apos;re going to make a own little net , they have a own little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is very simple , if they &apos;re completely independent , if they &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> anywhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re an island .
then you &apos;re just using that , which is the sun and wind there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a carbon-free energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful for us to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that , that &apos;s where we &apos;re doing , and in that , the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;re collectively going to be a collective and use solar energy , it &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i &apos;m just going to encourage you to just encourage you a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , i think , los angeles , a day of the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , <unk> , who played on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you will be familiar with the story , because from <unk> papers , a book was going to be <unk> and jamie <unk> when steve lopez <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve anthony <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who was launched by his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row in <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you to read all of you , <unk> book , to look at the film , so that it was helped to understand the wonderful connectedness , but also how the music has made that connection , and how it was allowed to be the instrument , when this pun is allowed to get the <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , to walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo ma and hillary and about how the dodgers would never create it into the baseball world , and this was all because of the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in the state that nathaniel had been interested in <unk> with me .
i have to mention that nathaniel <unk> a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric shocks , and he had been treated with electric shocks , and with <unk> , a trauma that has haunted him whole life .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenics to these schizophrenics . they are sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of <unk> row , always <unk> on the streets of <unk> , the horror of his own mind .
and in the same way , in the same <unk> , nathaniel , when we first was with our first class in walt disney concert hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted him to poison in sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i &apos;m afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could sink to the violin , and that i could destroy him on a violin , and that i started to destroy the violin , and i started talking about scale and <unk> and exciting forms .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes were a complete change in a complete change .
it was like it was under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose catalyst was my game .
<unk> ritual turned into understanding a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and started to play a few clips of <unk> , and then i asked me to play them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , and started talking about beethoven , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the others , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but she had a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d just know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and spoke about music , was from this <unk> man , a confused man , which was moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to do , and delusions with their imagination and creativity in something in a real world .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
and this is why we do music , so we do something that we &apos;re doing in all of us , in all of us , in our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression gets us all of us and moved , inspired and united us .
what nathaniel rope , put him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family that he understood his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to go back to nathaniel music with nathaniel music , whether in walt disney <unk> hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me why i &apos;d become musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> of the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like an passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a paper on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was bred to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be able to sell it to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the ceo of the company called , i asked if i could make a event in a event about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this incredible problem for our cooks has become , how do we keep fish on our lives ?
in the last 50 years , we have fish as we have <unk> forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so probably <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
a lot of arguments . <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , take a tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> from 15 to one .
so , 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
don &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; only to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow out in the ocean , that they don &apos;t grow the environment . &quot;
&quot; this is true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will not focus out of our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what is yours ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask me .
well , i &apos;m <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me a decent answer to me , until i finally did with senior senior biologists .
i &apos;m also calling him as well .
don &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin <unk> , dead <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
if maybe two percent of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m looking at this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even that .
no , i have <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish had chicken after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish .
i ate him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish .
it &apos;s sort of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
there &apos;s a chef <unk> .
wait twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make a fish , taste as well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we call it <unk> . actually he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by making the country .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they huddled water out of the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make this work , not economically .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what the place is a lot of birds .
and this is what bought a spanish company , bought a country green .
what did you do ?
you have the flow of the water around .
they literally get the levers .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they &apos;re <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and they &apos;ve completely moved to the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare at the horizon that is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels and these density , voluptuous , lush .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part &quot; a crocodile for kiss . &quot;
okay ? so , there we were and on the wetlands , and i were on the wetlands , and i was <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to my knees .
and he picks up a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here is a pattern of bundle it on the <unk> giraffe .
well , it turns out that <unk> has spent the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
and i asked him how he became so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert with relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and dropping into <unk> birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was fascinating , you know , the <unk> community of <unk> , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it be so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish are eating , what they were going to eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , phytoplankton , the plankton collapse , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm who doesn &apos;t get their animals ?
later , i went on on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like that , &quot; unlike any farm that i ever had been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was as if a director would have planned to do a <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , one literally <unk> the eye .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on the birds .
well last year , there was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it has become the largest and one of the most important private community in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing that you don &apos;t want to have the last one that you want to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the <unk> are the phytoplankton .
the pinker , the better the system the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t kill their animals and a farm that &apos;s their success in health of your predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , , by the way , this <unk> shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where it &apos;s better for the <unk> .
every morning , you fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because you can follow the bare white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of trip of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , do you fly 240 miles to the farm , and then you fly up to the side of the night ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me , i &apos;d just been quoted a song from whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost going to cook .
and yet , when i tried to try her in this restaurant in a <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted x-ray sounds .
it liked sweet and pure than you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned it to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that &apos;s its success at success .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it &apos;s enormous because the water that goes through this farm comes in the river from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are all the rivers today , they tend to lead chemical pollutants , flow from <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves , this leaves , clean , as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm who doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that literally measures their success , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , but not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water is <unk> , it <unk> the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you want to do it , because his love of love , as romantic , as romantic .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , actually taste good .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you say that that &apos;s the things that are the future of good food , someone else says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not , because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than only feed .
a billion people are born today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because you have the logic of our flu , the last 50 years .
feed in herbivores , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals on the earth , <unk> on fish , and all the time we &apos;re asking , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was something . it was the <unk> business business .
we should call them what she is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that makes fast <unk> capital , which enables exactly this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile country , not through pumps , but through <unk> water , not through <unk> , but not through <unk> and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to feed themselves ?
in order to do that , you don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never made a good thing to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that that &apos;s for two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds that are in themselves , and businesses that rebuild the relationships , and businesses that are <unk> , and farmers who are not only <unk> , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are experts in flavor .
and if i really be honest with you , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;d like to <unk> you today , it &apos;s that the totality of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about the sum of their parts , i want to think that it &apos;s going to be able to think about patterns , and we can see that trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are the most active and it &apos;s on the <unk> over here .
we can take one step further out and line the data up and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
so if we go on , and when we take on the age , we say 40 years , we &apos;ll see that accidents are even the cause of the main cause is that people should worry about people .
and who &apos;s going to see that is true of men in particular .
so you can see that this is a lot of information and data in this way in this way , in this way , in this way , is remembered in a living narrative .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not even about content themselves ?
so what we are now here is the <unk> of every single sports sports sport that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk to my talk .
with <unk> , she can dive in a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly at a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to put it in all of lance armstrong .
now , if i &apos;m just going to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything on the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take one step back and look at it .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , we &apos;re looking at this kind of information , wider , bigger <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re not looking for or not just <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single individual and put them into a little summary .
the summary contains a short picture and a symbol of the area that she comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this way , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get an idea about the issues that are on wikipedia to the <unk> .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i elected the government , i know , that the <unk> that most of them are most at the most time <unk> people in the year .
this is really important , because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single brain area .
it &apos;s just to realize that when you go back and look at the whole thing .
looking at a certain one of these summaries , i can go back to the subject of time , &quot; people in the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some , you get from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , the bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can go and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the web , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at the websites -- and we bring this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and you jump directly at a specific plate .
so that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at the look of websites in this way that can look at the same way in the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course of the time time .
here &apos;s the status of the demonstration that i kept here .
and i can tell everything that i &apos;ve seen today , again , <unk> .
and , if i take a step back , and i look at everything , i can start talking to my course , i can rearrange my course of the course of the <unk> , and here , i looked for <unk> , and here &apos;s after a live trip , or here &apos;s a live labs .
and from here , i can get in the side and go back to you .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes the picture greater than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking about being drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on your head , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , so that we &apos;re going to go to a lot of things , and that can see patterns that would be otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , it &apos;s going to be on the past , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get out of it .
and if we know , we can even pull out , we might even pull out out of it .
i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school , i went to school , every day an hour .
and my nose was always put in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts are tainted in other worlds , and in a <unk> way my deep curiosity <unk> curiosity .
the curiosity is also that i always was in school , when i wasn &apos;t in school , walked through the forests of the forests , walked through the forests , frogs and bugs and <unk> , and <unk> , everything went home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it &apos;s always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the way .
and my love in science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder we had never imagined before .
well , that &apos;s probably good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games , and there &apos;s no video games that gave the imagery of the landscape in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that . if we read a book , when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the canvas .
my reaction was to do this , and i think of aliens , aliens , robots , <unk> and all this .
i was constantly caught by the teacher , i was always caught in the textbook , hidden .
it had to be out of creativity .
and it happened something interesting , which was fascinated by the <unk> <unk> , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i &apos;m sure i would never have a alien world to get a spaceship . it seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter on the earth here on the earth , and she was also fascinating and fascinating as all of the things i &apos;ve always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> my father , until he finally got a <unk> in buffalo , new york , and two of the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in buffalo , new york .
the ocean but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 12,000 hours under water . 500 hours of it .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich as we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , human imagination .
so for the days , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean holding on , with the same intensity as ever .
and then when i <unk> a job as a adult job , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best opportunity , my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books and so .
so movies were able to get images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m looking at , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in the <unk> , i could connect my <unk> for the <unk> and diving with the filmmaking .
so , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create of liquid <unk> , and that we &apos;ve had to make a kind of liquid <unk> .
what it came out was the first <unk> <unk> that had ever seen in a movie .
so the film didn &apos;t put any money in the time , he just played his cost , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was just as <unk> from the magic that went out .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , we know the law of law is not different from each other .
so you saw something magical .
and i found that very exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more on .
together , with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and success hanging out of it , like that effect would be going .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money .
from these two experience , from these two experiences , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend stan , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was to be able to do the phase of analog processes with visual printers etc . , and start on digital <unk> .
and we then did that , and we got a competitive advantage in the time .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve actually started in the company -- too slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is written the bar in some of visual effects and <unk> effects in a whole new heights , with much human , expressive characters that were made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be all <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar hit very nicely , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that will fall .
the <unk> i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it became a <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but secretly , i wanted to get <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . it didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m convinced you , i believe , &quot; we dip in the wreckage . we go the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good marketing vehicle for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it &apos;s going back to it again , that your imagination can create a reality .
and we actually created six months later , a reality where i was in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really blew me out .
and in preparation , there were enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and everything .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , a noisy life .
well , they were also <unk> and more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , then you &apos;re floating into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope to be alive , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as well as i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was literally obsessed with the same deep sea .
anyway , from the part that have to do with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , and the science at the time when we saw them , he didn &apos;t find any words .
so that &apos;s really really <unk> , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i told me , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to come to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they explored it with <unk> .
we returned the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , and to look at the inner of the ship which has never been done before .
no one had ever explored the interior of the web . you didn &apos;t have a matter of it . so we developed the technology .
well , there i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is pretty similar to this <unk> here , and i know that once the band is played there .
and i can fly with a little video of the ship &apos;s license .
and i &apos;m actually <unk> it , but my consciousness was within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;d be physically within the titanic side of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a criminal form that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i took a corner , i always knew what &apos;s going to be in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to take months for months , because i was <unk> the film .
because the set of set was an accurate copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints .
so that was a highly strange experience .
and she made me aware that you use such a <unk> <unk> , and you can use the consciousness in the vehicle in this other form of existence .
it was really profoundly profound .
and maybe a small view of what may happen in a few decades could happen , if you &apos;ve been able to explore something to explore something or other things , in all kinds of things that i can imagine myself as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we began to learn what we saw at the bottom , for example , this <unk> , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s like aliens , but here , on earth .
they live with <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t exist in a <unk> system , as we do that .
and this is how you see animals , right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in the same time , and it was back again from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re sitting at nasa who are sitting on the space and they go to russia , you go to russia , and it goes to russia , they fly to russia , and it &apos;s going to go to the international criminal community , and they fly our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out that i took <unk> to the deep sea .
and i took them with them and <unk> them down to the world : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the vents , so i took them to look at samples and the tools and so on .
and we were stuck with in fact , but in fact , science , was done , more specifically , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence between my existence as a child , as a child , and execution into reality .
in the course of discovery of discovery of discovery .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure , you know , a director also needs to lead a leader , a leader or something .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do ?
why do i do this ? what &apos;s going to come out of ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of energy . it doesn &apos;t trace out .
all of you think i &apos;ve been thinking between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; touch , &quot; and he would have <unk> the nails somewhere on one towel .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the will to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there are the <unk> environment that there is , and because of the strange environment that creates when a small group of people make a team .
because we &apos;ve made all of this with only 10 to 12 people who worked nonstop for years . sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning is that you have each other , because you overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain one other .
if you go back to land , and says , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the whole technique , and the whole technology , and the whole thing , you know , the whole technique , and the whole thing , you can &apos;t explain the other , and the people who have something together , and you know , you know , you can never explain somebody .
there is a connection , which creates each individual .
so when i came back to go back to my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you hold his team and <unk> their respect .
and that &apos;s what really changed the dynamic .
so i was again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we <unk> &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that we didn &apos;t have before .
very exciting .
an awful lot .
and we were going to have a half four and a half years of time .
and it changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who said we would have really been very well <unk> and transported on the planet .
for me , it was more kind of a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get out of all that ?
what do we learn ?
i think the curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning your team is more important than all the world &apos;s <unk> .
i get a young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry yourself .
get others to you . don &apos;t make it even bet against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and the study , don &apos;t fail to be an alternative because there will give it a <unk> .
no important endeavor , has ever been done without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks like that .
and that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you to the way , and no failure is an alternative , fear , but thank you . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise may be surprising because my <unk> on the foundation mainly about vaccines and seeds to turn the things that we invent and deliver to the poorest 2 billion to allow the poorest two billion .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more important than everyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years , and we rain too much , and the things will rain , how it can &apos;t change their fragile environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
also , the <unk> for them is very important .
the fact is that if you could be able to reduce the price of the price , it would be far from far to the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like time .
it &apos;s actually based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s take the price -- we &apos;ll cut the price -- we hit a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they &apos;re <unk> carbon dioxide , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the result of the natural ecosystems , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt this very rapid changes and <unk> whole systems .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> , and which is <unk> <unk> , and where the other consequences are more , there are some cards , but not very many .
and there is certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
so , i &apos;ve asked the projects several times , &quot; we really have to get down to zero ?
no half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different as to say , we &apos;ve got a 12 feet high truck , which has to be under a three feet , and you can put it back underneath .
this is just going to go down to zero .
well , we get a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans , about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that get it down to zero .
it &apos;s very constant .
just different economic changes , it has changed all , and we have to have to spend <unk> rise to a reduction and a reduction in zero .
this equation has four factors -- a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left , and it &apos;s going to be on the number of people , and it &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people , the average energy for every service and the co2 , that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each one factor , and we think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it looks at nine billion entries going to go to 9 billion to the nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , which we could be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor are the services we use .
this is all , the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heat .
these are very good things , and <unk> means to make these services to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to do <unk> and use less use , but on average , that number is going to grow every year , and so more than double the number of services that are delivered the service of the services per person .
here we see a very powerful service . is there light at home to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , on efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s probably good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other forms , through new ways , in new ways , there are a lot of services , their energy , their energy , their energy to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , such as manufacturing from <unk> , 105 : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> -- &amp; lt , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s a source for improvements .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a factor of three or maybe a factor of three .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone up by 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that to zero .
when they burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every time of electricity today for electricity today , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i use the word &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
and people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
usually you &apos;re going to be wrong and some of them , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we need to be <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i deliver this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos , and somehow the people like that .
the idea was really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i got this one .
i decided that this was my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are a few natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all sorts of things like this , but they don &apos;t bring them a lot .
we need solutions , either or a small scale of scale , and even though there are many directions of scale , and even though there are many directions to look for people , i really see five things that can afford these big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
this may be a <unk> contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , the answer is that we need to work on all of those five work , and we can &apos;t give you all of them , because we can &apos;t give us all of them because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s take a look at the burning fossil fuels , by burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems maybe it seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes from burning from burning , moving under <unk> , and then put somewhere , and then hope that there is there .
there &apos;s a couple of bacteria that can make that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get a lot of co2 , and there &apos;s a big challenge for the supply of co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it sure ?
who can do something guarantee what literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard problem .
next , <unk> .
it also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human engagement , despite human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are potentially soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and they have -- although it &apos;s great that they have no fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that make these technologies are generating dramatically than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , a thousand times more than a normal power station .
moreover , these sources of interruptions .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t fly the wind constantly .
that &apos;s why you have to depend on these sources , it &apos;s a way , you have the energy in times if they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges on transmission . if we say that the energy source outside of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk that the energy of where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension to the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , and that &apos;s what the world uses , and that &apos;s what the world uses , and that &apos;s what the world uses , and that &apos;s what the world uses , and i found that all the batteries we are now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to say these <unk> sources of <unk> , 30 percent of the rest of the energy .
if you want to support to 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of brain .
well , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
and i think here in the ted group there are a lot to get together there .
bill <unk> has several companies , including one called <unk> that has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , making great things and interesting ways , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , is tracking a nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
development has stopped in this industry at a few time ago , so there &apos;s no surprise that some good concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that instead of one part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate reasonable whether it was going to work , but since since there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , with the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s a deal .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the <unk> is much better .
in fact , you burn waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as <unk> .
instead of breaking your head , burning it , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is incremental , a little like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column that &apos;s a lot of a plank of &quot; traveling of reactor reactor reactor . &quot;
it really solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste of 99 percent . you have the part that is burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
this is the u.s. u.s. military for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re inexpensive and easy , and it &apos;s just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and still more agriculture , and hopefully , <unk> , and hopefully <unk> and clean .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their lifestyles completely change .
the other note says if we use the technology technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this becomes an key feature of this system .
if we go back from there , what might be testimony to 2020 ?
it should have the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reducing the way , the less we get down , the smaller ones will be down and the temperature also will be the temperature .
but in fact , this note is the things that we are doing , which we don &apos;t have to go to the big <unk> , just the same way , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to follow these breakthroughs with <unk> and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are a lot of great books on this topic .
al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> energy uses <unk> energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed in which this is going to be discussed , because we need for all sides .
there are a lot that has to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish , that we invent this technology .
if you just take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose that wish , or i could choose this wish , and i could take this wish , and i would take this wish , i would take this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it &apos;s going to be horrible between the long-term and <unk> , between the united states and china , between the united states and rich and rich and rich , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what things do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss these <unk> , and they would be shocked by ridiculous low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , controlling co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead dialogue and lead full and all the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of the investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer doing all the big scientists , which we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works sensible , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> to find more billion to find more billion and the place that actually build the first of it .
and as soon as i promised , when it promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the profit , the energy density is so different than <unk> as we know it .
to understand the right : this is almost like a vertical column in the ground almost like a vertical column , and then the process begins , and then the process begins on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . today , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor over , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong and go wrong , and it &apos;s going to go wrong and <unk> , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think about a plank -- it &apos;s buried in a column without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns it for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that offers a solution to the trash .
<unk> : yes . well , what happens to the waste : you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor , and then you burn it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste that has already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in these reactors . this is our <unk> .
so , what is a problem for these reactors , which is what we fill in our own , and it will be reduced to dramatically as a process of the process .
but while they talked about different people in the world .
where is the biggest interest in doing this ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t put us up in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s carrying in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> and talked about how this fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese are doing something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , that &apos;s why everybody who has a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first one .
in your mind , <unk> and probability and likelihood of calling something like this ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to make .
so this is kind of the deadline that we demonstrated the <unk> that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything &apos;s right , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easy .
and fortunately , there &apos;s dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of things that work on their pilots for their pilots to make it <unk> .
and it would be best if there &apos;s several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the great possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would be even without the <unk> , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid shift , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty of this is that a million times so much energy has a million times so much energy , as one , if you can deal with the problems , and so , if you can deal with the problems , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league , almost in a league .
if it doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try to keep the services stable ?
<unk> : if you come into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and in front of a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need an <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> map that &apos;s called <unk> , which is trying to <unk> the warming to <unk> the warming , so we had 20 or 30 years longer to <unk> us .
this is just a <unk> .
you know , you don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work in the insurance because you don &apos;t have to work on insurance , so you eat , so you eat , because you know that you know that is going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> , if you have to have it faster , if things come faster , or that innovation needs to be faster than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for them to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you tell that negative effects that have done with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistake now , and you pay a lot more later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of problems , if you have all sorts of problems to invest in something that you &apos;re going to do is that the investment is not so clear , and there &apos;s people in the rich world , and there &apos;s people in the rich world that will look at and say , okay , it &apos;s not a great drama .
the fact is that the uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make economic economically , and then the skeptics are going to say that it &apos;s no co2 , i wished to say that it &apos;s no co2 , but i &apos;m going to make it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all the time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals is fighting malaria , and so on that there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources , and so on that there &apos;s a bad waste of resources , while there are better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it &apos;s not supposed to suffer other things .
you get to big <unk> , and here can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund it . for me , most of the waste is happening .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short , you &apos;re just going to fund the learning curve , and i think we should try to try more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> that you get , it &apos;s a very high <unk> , you can only keep up the rich .
i mean , each of us here could be five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
it &apos;s now , &quot; why is the research not talking more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , which was associated with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he takes the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that gets supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter <unk> introduced a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and the idea is pretty simple . <unk> has to have the greatest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about a meter tape , about a meter of tape , about three marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard , because people are pushing very quickly together .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since since then , i did about 70 workshops in the world with students , students and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something that makes deep sensations in nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them .
typically , most people start to orient itself to the orient .
you talk about it , you think about what it is going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
then you &apos;re going to invest a little time in planning and organization . they &apos;re drawing and put in spaghetti sauce .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> .
and finally , short before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put them gently down to the top , step back , you &apos;ll admire your work .
but what happens is , almost always , it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; is because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more , <unk> <unk> than others , and among the worst is fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there &apos;s teams that have a lot more , <unk> <unk> , and among the best are new york students of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , what is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids invested in the spaghetti time to be <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> <unk> were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s going to do is that you start to start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that she <unk> the possibility of fixing prototypes .
<unk> shows this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each time , the kids get immediate feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of doing prototypes , a lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of us lies at about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , more than adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
three is the highest , what i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but this is going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator at the team , they will significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and recognize , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special capabilities in the world .
they lead the process , you understand it .
and that team that <unk> and they look at the work will be important to improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , the characteristic , you get about six that have robust structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s take the <unk> .
so i offered a $ $ six dollars for the winner .
what happened to you ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a temporary construction , he would have carried the price home .
so , is it not interesting that high forms is a strong effect ?
we went through these practice with the same student .
what happened now ?
now it understood the benefit of the prototyping .
that &apos;s how it became the worse team of the best .
it &apos;s the highest construction in the lowest construction .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
and you might ask , why would someone actually invest in creating a <unk> company ?
the reason is , i can help digital tools and processes to help some teams to help cars and video games .
and what the <unk> does , it helps you to identify a hidden assumptions .
because open , frankly , a project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or ethos to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and those of you who &apos;s interested in the world can go to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , actually , this is the construction sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and we &apos;re using our thinking optimal how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do this as a machine .
a big machine , a big , playful machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room must be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends for a lot of time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time , or twitter or twitter or , &quot; america &apos;s looking for the idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you can somehow be drawn to the <unk> , to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , you go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that had ever been on the planet , no matter how scale you do , health , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died , everybody died when they were 60 .
my grandparents spend this number on <unk>
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is born in new delhi today , as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve been shaped the demographics of the earth in a way , like any war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases exist that the millions of us are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , which are successes in the scientific way .
and from my view , the scientific method , things try to try things , look , if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people on this world every day to bed every day .
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and this is embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : gas : they disappear , and they &apos;re not going to go from that chaos , we &apos;re going to go away .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think it &apos;s .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country , to rape , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that it &apos;s not destroyed .
i think that really , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night , and we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we also were also able to be able to make it sensible as we can do it today .
we &apos;re at amazing , amazing events on a lot of areas , and yet , i really think that we would have to go back hundreds of 300 years before the enlightenment , we &apos;d have to go back to a time that we have to fight progress in which we &apos;ve been fighting about these things , more fronts than now .
people are moving into their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth will free it .
and listen , everybody has a right in his opinion ; even a fairly way to make the progress .
but you know , what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have it right on your own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about immunization for &quot; the new yorker . a little article .
and i was amazed to come on resistance , on resistance , on resistance to what the most effective procedure in health care is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just do what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i &apos;ve written about an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that molecules would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules in a particular rather rather than a random form of nature in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we type we &apos;re going to eat , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles worried me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who didn &apos;t know all the <unk> at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that made me mess .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as early .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about that , with a couple of quotes , which is &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in the science , sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it doesn &apos;t be so .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> of mass destruction , the 2,000 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . so , be skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand it .
don &apos;t take anything than granted .
but now here &apos;s the evidence that you have to take the evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that from the reason that we now live in an epidemic in an epidemic , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago a story was published a story , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with us , <unk> , <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
and lots of studies were done to see if that was true .
so a lot of studies should be done ; this is a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all right , no correlation , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe what we see , we think what we see is what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe on a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
catastrophic ways of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world that goes down to measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
because there anybody here ?
did one one in the audience ever see anyone in measles ?
not very often happens .
in this country , not , but 160,000 times over the world last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can do it , and people like jenny , and people like jenny and illiteracy of platforms like jenny and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and illiteracy of live to preach .
and you can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it was <unk> us from one of the worst evolutionary counterparts .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , pop up .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed with some other people .
he can save the life of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , except of vaccines to talk about vaccines and vaccines , says how much they are , and that people will just stop <unk> .
and this is actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul was talking to a public standpoint , he can &apos;t tell any arms of <unk> .
he gets calls home , because people love to tell him where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
so you take them back to the disease , horrible diseases , and this is happening .
we &apos;ve got measles in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
what about <unk> ? take that . why not ?
so a <unk> of mine had written me a few weeks ago , and i told you a little bit about <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe you have a day in lagos , a plane in lagos , and you just fly to los angeles , in the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> today .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . do not as if it &apos;s not .
we love to play in lying . we love that .
did you all have the vitamins ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> , which helps you go jumps .
i know that they &apos;ve done that because half of americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . more than never never do .
that &apos;s okay , they like to <unk> <unk> billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> themselves that can afford .
so we run away from that , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s a serious business , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of props here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;ll give billions of dollars for it ; it was .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream out and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do the people , do what you want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some <unk> who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go on this way , where believe and the magic , replace the science and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 of his people around , because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as antiretroviral drugs , of which we know that you can actually stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths deaths in a country that becomes worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a healing debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every branch , every branch , every branch , each <unk> , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we did it in the last eleven 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked , and some of it don &apos;t work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more more , and of course , there are risks , and we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend millions of people to prolong millions of people .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re re-engineering food , re-engineering food .
why do we do that ?
well , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to catch seeds .
and you know what my answer is about ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix we .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of evolution , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow us to do the science , because we &apos;re scared , and it keeps a <unk> , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shameful . shameful .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? re-engineering food . re-engineering food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like they died .
they &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s only a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all the right in it .
and then people could eat that , and they would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to have genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones to greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , which is about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far as we do so far as we do , we think , i think , not want to be guilty of all colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation you want to say , &quot; you want to say , &quot; don &apos;t you want to go to this ridiculous machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to do that .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can put them up where we want them to <unk> , and we will move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine , and we &apos;re going to be happy to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a few time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician &apos;s interested in that , it &apos;s a way i &apos;m interested in , as &quot; a deception that will be real , if somebody &apos;s just noticed enough that . &quot;
in other words , there &apos;s a measurable effect in some studies , a measurable effect , which is what happens to you , because the person &apos;s going to do what happens to you , for example , if the patient is only enough to do it , a measurable effect in the body that is a measurable effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
it becomes a deception to something real , because someone it changed .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least for least since the 1950s , in every time for the 1950s .
i even learned him from <unk> <unk> in the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll explain it for you and then explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , look at what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to keep the knife just in my hand .
i push my sleeves .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve or come out of it , i &apos;m just going to do my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that it &apos;s going to move anything . as long as i can go here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes good , the knife will be held through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually in its place in fact that i can shake it , without the knife like like the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no <unk> , and they can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i &apos;ve got a lot of children who are interested in magic , because you can find a lot about deception , because you can look very much about deception , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably , many of you here in the room here in the room .
and it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing goes away in my sleeve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that that &apos;s the actual secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i put my hand out of you , so you see them from the back of the back , and you see it from the back , my favorite , just from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
a great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who &apos;s not a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> me , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t recognize that there are only three fingers , because the mind and the way it took information , they don &apos;t count one , one , two , three , but they have a group .
but that &apos;s actually not about this , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be stuck there , but not the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i leave my hand , the same thing is going to be going on by putting myself through this movement , that the finger is coming back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show them your friends and neighbor . thank you .
now , what has to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really was really blown away me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
and that turns out , if you offer a placebo against a white pill on a white pill in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just one round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you make the shape that you give this placebo against placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and put this blue and put this blue and put a letter on it , they &apos;re actually measurable .
and that , although none of them do -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good like a blue pill .
what ? that really popped me out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not anything .
if you take capsules these are more effective than pills pills .
a colored capsule , which is yellow at an end and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dose is a role .
a pill twice a day , not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the carefully statistic . i &apos;m sorry .
and the key thing is , ...
well , it &apos;s a role to play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate herring , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected to a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . this is a lot more stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector of projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really valid property . it &apos;s just our faith in us that are a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a trick .
i take something that is obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the way .
this is an inch for 18 inches . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of a little bit sterile .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not very special meat meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and push through them through the other side .
if you get evil -- if you fall out , i &apos;m presented with a couple of friends last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman who i didn &apos;t know .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to look very quickly , you look for the next 30 seconds , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to find the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same thing , but you can also tell you if you want .
so , it &apos;s like that , right here , where my meat begins at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that ?
and just just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side , again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had in the same situation .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , and it &apos;s not so stupid to have the skin just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the schools are coming in now .
let me show you out of the closeness .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can get the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going to look away , look away , don &apos;t look away .
people in the back or the ones that will see at the video at some time , you &apos;ll say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impressive , but if it would be real impressive , it &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me <unk> a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i &apos;m usually going to take the needle .
i would show my arm clean and show you that there are not wounds .
but i think in this frame here and the intention of doing something real , i &apos;ll just get the needle in it , and let &apos;s go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to get a few times at the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be excited about it . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people to count the number of books that were published in the past five years , and they gave them about 40 years , and they gave up a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all the tide of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act about these cognitive traps .
and this is true for <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so confused as everybody else .
the first one of these traps is a <unk> to admit .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
and i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could just be able to give it , but in the big and all of the things that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to think of the complicated view of what is what makes .
the second trap is the experience of experience and memory : essentially , they are between happy and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the miserable fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact to distort well-being without its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who said he was heard a symphony , &#91; unclear ... he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely a symphony of the recording .
and then he added , really pretty emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had <unk> music in 20 minutes .
they didn &apos;t know because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had kept .
what it really says is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the present is capable of experiencing the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt , &quot; does it hurt when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that you can get the <unk> and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that allows the physician to make the question , &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or , how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units , and the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this starts really starts with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts to immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we feel about from our experiences is a story .
and let me start <unk> with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that block a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and you &apos;ll ask , &quot; who of both have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain who had the patient a patient had a patient .
but there &apos;s another question , &quot; how do these patients thought they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a a much worse <unk> <unk> had the <unk> for the patient .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a big part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear worse than the others .
and the ones that is worse , where the pain is all at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people for their peers , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing about ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as for b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view b clearly b clearly had an inferior time .
well , what you could do is , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually be <unk> the <unk> of the patient as you just shake the tube to make it too much to him .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do it for a few minutes , you can do that the <unk> itself is a <unk> on the patient , and you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a much better thing , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what is what draws a story ?
and this is true for the stories that make us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and so a story of a narrative is turnarounds , and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> self lives continuously .
it &apos;s a little bit of moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most moments of our lives , of our lives -- and i have this point -- they know that there &apos;s about 600 million of them for about three seconds . what means that there &apos;s about 600,000 million of it . there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave behind .
most of them will be completely ignored by ourselves .
and yet , you get to get the impression that they should count that as these moments of dna is going to happen to our lives .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use while we are in the world .
and as we use them to be important , but it &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is about time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday , and the second week , as well as the first week is the first one , the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a holiday is not better than the <unk> holiday , because there are no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> itself , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient , you know , we have two <unk> at two different surgeons , and decides what he &apos;s supposed to choose less bad , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that is selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as smart memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self itself , and you can think of yourself as a tyranny of self as one , which is the <unk> self by experience that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that when we do vacation , that means that we do , and we do vacation , mostly in the service of the market itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve made a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think pretty often in terms of how often i think about the other time , how often i often think about .
and i probably &apos;ve probably seen my memories on this <unk> journey , i would tell about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever opened the <unk> of the folder with the 600 pictures i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours and a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , like a little appetite , i have a <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to give memories so much weight on the weight of the weight of the weight that we make ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the beach all their images are <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember anything .
well , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you would choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how they &apos;re going to choose that conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , you think , because if you think of memories of memories , you could get another answer .
why we pick up the <unk> that we find is a problem with a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are these moments in the life of itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> itself over time .
if you &apos;re talking to the happiness of yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfied or pleased the person to think about your life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different is different from happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , and i &apos;m one of researchers talking about well-being that we screwed up for happiness .
so the distinction between happiness &apos;s happiness and the happiness of the self is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure both of the two practices .
the gallup organization organization has a worldwide poll where more than half a million people are asked about what you think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of self .
and the main lesson that we believe is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and it doesn &apos;t tell you a lot of how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an impression of a correlation , a correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody is eight on a scale of 10 on a decade , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with its <unk> self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness &apos;s happiness is .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly happy to be satisfied with people that we like , time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the two species of self , you will do very different things .
the implication of what i said here is that we &apos;re very lucky to think of happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we &apos;re not focusing on the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you think of this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate are not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to the hope to be happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about how terrible the weather in ohio was in ohio , and they will feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup poll .
is this something that you can leave us from , because you have a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found at the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of <unk> itself .
if we looked at how feelings are vary with income .
and it turns out that under income from 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample below 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year is people unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy , the poorer you will .
and we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not buying a <unk> , but that lack of money out of money are certainly miserable , and we can measure this misery very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> itself , you get another story .
the more money you are worthy of happiness .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , all the american <unk> is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on your head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
there &apos;s a chance that politicians that the country generally take a <unk> as seriously , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s evidence for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , you &apos;re going to happen in the united kingdom , and in other countries you &apos;re going to happen .
and people are able to recognize that you should think of happiness when you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether you want to explore <unk> or whether you want to explore outcomes , so we need to have this discussion .
as you can be lucky , very different depending on how you think , and whether they think about ourselves , or whether you think about ourselves .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be in the next one or two or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been going to be <unk> now for 10 years . and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to do the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time with playing play , more and more time with playing games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time if you think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite appropriately .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most most problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase the time .
i calculate that it took time for 21 billion hours for <unk> billion hours a week .
this seems to be a little bit more <unk> , so i repeat it , so i repeat it , so if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes exactly why i think that games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings , and so he got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but very good enough enough , so , very <unk> in the solving a really difficult problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see , you see a few nuances here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are a sign of optimism .
this is a player that stands on on the edge of what &apos;s called &quot; <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so extremely positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something like that . this is a <unk> victory .
there &apos;s a very short victory of victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world , when we take the hurdles of the next century , the face of the next century , the face of the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we meet difficult problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life i am bad . &quot; <unk> , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis that i &apos;m doing in my ph.d. why we are better than the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think that we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as they are .
and i &apos;m not just less successful , even though this is .
we &apos;re going to do more . i mean , i &apos;m good at the context of motivation to do something more <unk> , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and instantly , to solve the problem , to solve the problem , as long as you need to try to try it again .
and in reality , if we fail to get out on obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated , we feel threatened . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed or <unk> .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible to think , to think , you can &apos;t just achieve anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings of play in reality ?
so i looked like world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that &apos;s going to be derived in <unk> , so possible .
so , first , if you get in one of this <unk> , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to get you a <unk> mission .
but not just some mission , but a mission to fit perfectly at your current level , right ?
so you do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to do . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn <unk> . there are always important to do something important .
and there are plenty of employees .
and where you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that way in the real life , that sense , that at a <unk> of a <unk> of our staff .
there &apos;s the epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve driven by the level of &quot; level , &quot; and &quot; it belongs to it or &quot; 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in life .
if i &apos;m going to leave this stage , i didn &apos;t say , + 1 : a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not getting the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it is that it &apos;s so satisfying , any time on the edge of a <unk> , that we want to spend our whole time in these trade-offs .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> has spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound <unk> .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million years ago , we started to go upright .
the first way to go in .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re going to spend play with play , that &apos;s just a sense of making a sense of the scale of the human development of the human development of the eyes that &apos;s extraordinary .
but it &apos;s also appropriate . because it turns out that we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people .
we develop collaborative thinking , cook creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
let &apos;s look at this interesting statistic that recently came from a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person today , in a country with powerful <unk> spent 10,000 hours to the 21st of age .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours in the united states , they &apos;re going to spend in school and spend the fifth grade to conclude by high school -- if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a complete tour of this , where young people learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of them have a new book inspired by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours to be able to spend any matter to the 21st of a 21st century , we will give up in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever , whatever the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a total generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers are good good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never seen human potential to be available .
so many people , we currently have in the world that spend at least an hour every day per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> system evolved to save energy and work on <unk> , rather than <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so in india , in india , china , in india , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is what these games are to master .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first , <unk> .
ok , imagine this like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately to do a hurdle , to believe that we have to succeed with success .
and players always believe that a complete victory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth trying to try and go .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
there are a lot of interesting research that we want to show people more than we played with them , even when they defeated us .
the reason is that there is a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that a time with us spend time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to be able to stay with it .
so this allows the <unk> of <unk> from <unk> , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours is playing a week , like <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier , working hard to work hard than we can relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings are optimal when we do hard to do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when you get the right task .
and ultimately , climate matter .
players love it to become part of the awe of awe of the brain .
here &apos;s a <unk> to turn it into the same light , you know all of wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you &apos;ve collected more information on world of warcraft on the internet than some other subject in every other new <unk> .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
they are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real one .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to witnesses less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is logical by an economist .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that that makes sense , because gamers can reach more than the real life .
you can make stronger social bonds as a real life , and they can get more feedback and rewards in games as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world as in real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , for 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
there was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
the games were playing games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom of starvation .
it was supposed to be such a large famine , that the king of <unk> decided to have a <unk> idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> a national strategy , you would eat a national strategy . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating , and with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded by <unk> , they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the <unk> , she survived these famine years that they ate and ate the next day .
as well , i think , let &apos;s put games today .
we sit out of games to get out the real world .
we &apos;re going to put games to all of the things that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially it doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and we get what we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 years , after 18 years , after 18 years , the famine decided , so the king decided to be a last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the victor to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and looked at the search for a new home , and they were just going to leave a lot of people as well as food to survive and they were looking at the rest of the area where they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but recent <unk> show that the <unk> that the <unk> that then was going to be the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently came to the notion that <unk> <unk> story actually is true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global science system that could explain almost 20 years of what could explain .
so this might be this crazy story .
you may actually have saved their people by playing for 18 years , and then they have <unk> for 18 years , and then they had these <unk> and so much about them to play with each other that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also do that .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played <unk> for 18 years , we have warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re willing to be ready for our own personal game .
so they sent half their civilization for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be able to do it that half of us have spent an hour per day playing playing games until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and this question , i &apos;ve got my work in the institute in the institute in the institute .
we have this banner in palo alto , it presses how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people make people to make this idea into reality .
we think we &apos;re wins wins , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i designed to get to try to provide people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , but we have a real life to be realistic , so they &apos;re going to get a real life , and they &apos;re going to get out of how much oil is going to be true , and then you have to figure out how to make your real life , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it would be true , and we ask them to be blogging about it , videos or photos .
we tested this game with 1,700 players , and we &apos;ve been accompanied it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players have <unk> behavior in play .
so , we have a bigger , higher goal , higher goal than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called <unk> at the institute of the future .
the starting point is computation &apos;s calculation is that the people left only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the global <unk> <unk> .
so the call to a player , to sign , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you know , jerry <unk> , where it is &quot; <unk> , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on march 3rd , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in 2010 , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and funding it is to learn , social learning .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high , &quot; for <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you to invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , especially in the world , who are going to benefit from their own social company to save their own social company to save the world .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think , next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree with me that there are the human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these disparate superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make tight social nets , <unk> and the desire to be important .
i really hope that we play major games in order to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play .
if i went into the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create any future imaginable , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start games games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i &apos;ve seen a couple of months ago when i was writing a little article on a few months ago .
i always have my <unk> hand right now , but i was going to have the work of text done , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been able to <unk> in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; , &quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so hurt , also hurt , useless and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list out of a friend according to a friend and read , it had to laugh , but i had to stop reading , but i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading after this <unk> <unk> and with the emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> old <unk> , and i just thought that the issue is really quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i started with elementary school , and i started to build my sense of self outside of my family sphere , and to form my sense of different children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that somebody like me was a person who can be positive in any way , whose lives can be positive in any way . now , i &apos;m going to have the opportunity to be celebrated .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i would expect that i find a <unk> piece .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that describe to this words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and as we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks , really believed that the pronunciation was a great force , because what you have is a great force , because what you can do loud .
so , what do we actually do <unk> -- one disabled man or a powerful people ?
you know , you know , an people who are going to call a child , you might be <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> and ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be fun to open the doors ?
one person that opened for me the doors was my pediatrician at a <unk> dupont institute in <unk> <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name is , how you can think that most americans couldn &apos;t do correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies , and he was just created with children as well .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to be repeating individual exercises , rather than a lot of times , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- and i hated them . and i hated them . i hated her . i hated her . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a <unk> child with dr. p. , and i tried to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me in one day -- these things were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you are so strong , powerful and young girl , you will give one of those tape .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the way that richest year-old girls were going to be in the ward of the world , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes , and it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself about how much his vision of me and powerful young girls , and i was formed to myself , and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and powerful and <unk> human .
this is just one example of a lot of how adults can encourage a child &apos;s imagination .
but as we already prove about <unk> examples of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t have a room to imagine something that we all wish to do is to allow us to see it to each other as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were triggered in many cases in many cases .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , you can tell that my legs , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from titan , and we have an identity of the power of the aging body that allow people to make a own identity , and people can allow people to be able to make a own identity , and they can be able to define an own identity in the world , orient to groups around the world that they pick themselves .
so perhaps this is what this sort of shows this technological change very clearly because it has always been a different truth , which is that every human society can be able to adapt to a lot of society and very powerful and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always felt about me , and i &apos;m always feeling so uncomfortable , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable , and i &apos;m always feeling so uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i think i &apos;m going to understand why .
so this phrase from trying to live with <unk> lives , that success or happiness depends on the challenge , as if my life would be so successful , and as if my life would be so successful , because i could dodge the way of a life with a prosthesis , or whatever people have seen me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotional or emotional or even either .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> is no obstacle that we need to be <unk> to be able to get better with our lives .
<unk> are just in our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> than my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s very much to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of the impact of the <unk> of the <unk> of a human .
there are <unk> in life and challenges , and these are just <unk> and every person &apos;s real , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to be able to get <unk> or not , but how we &apos;re going to get out of it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepare to get good to get out of it .
and we &apos;re not going to look like our kids , if we give you the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to be clear two things to be surprised to be an amputee , and the other social believe about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only one and sustained , which i had to sit apart with me , is that the world is constantly saying that the world is constantly explaining to this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart of the heart , and even hard , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even to ask a forecast to the quality of life that you expect , we have to pay attention to the beginning that someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the way that you &apos;re in the concept that you &apos;re looking at what &apos;s broken in one , and how we repair this , for every single disability than the pathology at pathology .
if we weren &apos;t holistically through people else , and not all its forces and possibilities and acknowledge , we create to the natural battle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we <unk> a man who has a value for our society .
so we have to look out about the <unk> and look at all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great <unk> , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be <unk> or denial , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it , and we should be able to avoid them from the carpet , but it &apos;s about that to recognize opportunities .
i may be more likely to say that we don &apos;t necessarily have to be able to get rid of <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to hug them , but that we &apos;re open to hug them in the <unk> , and maybe even dance .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> than something natural , <unk> and useful and feel that through their presence through their presence .
that year , we celebrate 200 . anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote over 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , you know , very true in the human character .
i would rearrange it so that is not the most powerful of its species , and also not the <unk> of its way , but that can be the best thing to adapt .
that &apos;s what creativity creates creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the clash of human mind is defined by conflicts of conflicts .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what we &apos;re carved from the wood of wood , when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps that is the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning that &apos;s going beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are there for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
frankly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal one .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical one , but not the normal one , and you would really know the poor , gray person , you want to know if you really want to know ?
i don &apos;t think not .
it would be great if we can do this paradigm of normal against another of the possibilities or the strength to make it even a little bit of a little bit more dangerous , and you invite them to release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their own special and valuable skills into society .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always got people from the members of our society , and they &apos;ve always claimed to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals have older people around 60,000 years ago , and people have worn older people with heavy physical injuries , and it might happen because the <unk> of the human life was valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable treated .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in the red zone in this red zone in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i look at this older man , and i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you shouldn &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her first , i brought her from her mother to her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it made a click click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who knew just from stories about this day about this day , because i was , of course , very typical to my birthday was two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics my mother , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been pointed out , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never run , and you would never be going to be an independent life , or you could never lead me to independent life , and they were just going to lie to me . &quot;
it &apos;s really extraordinary , i found that he gathered my whole childhood cream in my entire childhood , whether i had my scholarship in the world , whether i had my scholarship , and he used these clips to <unk> his students , and he used these clips from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his favorite x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical that can be the quality of life for the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> went on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you don &apos;t get a little bit other , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get children themselves , children can do very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with that , two different things .
and i also have changed the course of the time when you had asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i had my prostheses on legs and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have <unk> .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experiences .
and perhaps this change could happen also , because i &apos;ve seen so many people who opened up so many people , instead of trying to be able to be able to cut me , or i wanted to make an idea of <unk> .
you see , it takes just one people you can show you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to get someone to activate your own , internal forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- and the human mind is so <unk> -- if you make a door , you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them up to open the doors .
the meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is in one , that is the potential for survival .
again , what potential do we want to use ?
in the 1960s , one case was done in the &apos; u.k. , they were transformed into <unk> <unk> .
they call this <unk> <unk> in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student will be <unk> harder , get better teachers and so on .
they then have a <unk> period of time to students with a &quot; well , you know , you know , they were very good , they said they were very smart , they were very smart , and after these three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it breaks the heart to hear the heart of the <unk> , it was told that they are only enough .
and it &apos;s the same way after three months .
but just those who are still in school -- besides the students who tossed the high school .
the key at this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just said that be the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a spirit of a mind that has broken a mind that has broken no hope . he &apos;s not missing our natural , <unk> , <unk> and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we do it , but if we create the human mind , continue to help themselves and other people around themselves and other people to find , curious and <unk> , we actually put our forces really positive .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and the poem knows god , not the god of the name , not the god who knows , &quot; every child who knows only four words , but the god who knows only four words , he always says : come on dance with me . &quot;
come on dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are currently ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more accurate , more more and faster and faster .
or want to be <unk> , stronger , have more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how about good health to live longer ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of them who are always getting more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
a few . probably about the creative people here here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i love as a doctor .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is this all a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the opinion of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , i once wrote an essay with the title , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of any sense of evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who are not taking the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get your personal <unk> , and i &apos;ll give you the <unk> , and i &apos;ll give you a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , which is about wrong , because nothing else is going to be wrong with you .
but if they accept biological evolution , what you think is it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or is it also us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have put a bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , and they &apos;ve had success ; it has its surroundings .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , it was 20 or 25 different varieties of disciplines from hominids .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the most part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite the same .
so , you realize that we can pull out of it and make the mechanisms of a bacterium to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat a diabetic &apos;s phone ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about about bacteria is that each of us in our gut of us in our gut is all more bacteria than the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times so many .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks you , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all nutrients that they would only want to do with any effort in their own .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> , <unk> the outcome .
but otherwise you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about three to four billion years ago -- the first <unk> of creatures , perhaps about three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , and then the human species , and then the human species , which shapes in the last <unk> years .
in this huge floating symphony of the universe , it &apos;s only a long way of life on earth , and the animal kingdom , like a single length of sync , and human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
and this is also what i &apos;m talking about from this speech , that &apos;s why i hope they liked it .
well , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to run in both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms came out , things started to change .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and basically , in the introduction of sexual reproduction , the end of sexual reproduction , the rest of the body will <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of our body is going to enter our body in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / death , death of sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it came to my increasing doubt .
i came to this to understand the emotions of george burns , who <unk> his show his show in the 90s in the &apos; 90s .
and one night there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i will take the soup . &quot;
i came to the doctor as a doctor that i was a goal of <unk> , as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health for a disease .
i wanted to lead to a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about treating the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you &apos;re and i &apos;ve developed as <unk> rockets to send the genetic flow into the next level of the orbit , to go into the sea .
i think we would all bring the mood , and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer life .
it &apos;s not inevitably the biggest or the fastest , or the fastest , not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and that &apos;s where fish would survive , if fish were there , there are vacuum vacuum , in the result , they &apos;ve managed to do a <unk> environment .
so , what means that if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and most importantly , how we went into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a range of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of balance .
and the reasons for that would be that we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and been away from the population .
and second , we as a species of our environment as well that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us that they adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and circulate and circulate us so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution of evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it becomes an evolution of the traditional way , of course , imposed from nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are <unk> .
and so far that isolation is , when we colonize a species planet , it will be insulation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new evolution that not just is , of course , but led by us , and decided of us as <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s see the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also in the body of genetic adaptations that can heal disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do that changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome in a price of about $ about $ about $ about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long for a long time to be the reality that it will be the 1,000 human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , at the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , who encourage the natural process of evolution that encourage the natural process of evolution , to work faster and <unk> proteins -- which is <unk> arnold , <unk> evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the creator of the scientist was awarded the scientist <unk> for his research in which he took an <unk> <unk> , and by the manipulation of just four genes that go to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially to be able to take any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria that can produce viruses that can &apos;t be protection in front of themselves , but also the immunity to other viruses can serve .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gait with influenza , which has been grown in the cells in the cells .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
this is all today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
then imagine two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> , or the <unk> , you could change your children a better chance to make a better chance -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of diabetes , the risk of cancer ?
who wants to not want a healthier child ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science , the same motor of science can enable us to prevent disease , also allowed us to adopt <unk> , <unk> -- better memory -- better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that can allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it in a thousand years , and we can compress it in a thousand years , and maybe even over the next hundred years .
these are decisions with these grandchildren , or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more more accurate that is more friendly ?
or will we be selectively controlled different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to make a society form and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to need to make this decisions ?
so in good like evil , and before you think , you might think that these decisions will be on us .
thank you .
and i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or one else , which helps to stand up and get up .
we &apos;re at berkeley at berkeley in berkeley .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning , and that gives you extra strength and push their speed further , and they &apos;re going to help them to keep their balance for example .
this is actually the true one of human and machine .
but not just that -- it goes together and connect them to the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers that carries about 100 pounds on the back of his back , and there is the request to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would think that we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds about <unk> terrain , many hours .
so flexible design is allowing it deep to close to living , to go and carry and highly modified movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and raise my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re in the way that we have to imagine our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our view on the wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people , the world &apos;s estimated in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , who was in the <unk> of her life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s from the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population whose number multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or the wheelchair is a wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been about 500 years , as i said , really successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me introduce you to you now that by amanda <unk> , who was worn by 19 years ago , who had the outcome that she could not run for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , is our <unk> .
it &apos;s got sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> , which you move forward to this kind of <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every movement and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after that , not long after that , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to go to me and learn to climb , to climb , and actually drive the hands of wheel .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for amanda , and for amanda , , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of the <unk> of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t leave the poverty of poverty , i &apos;m a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> of the fire .
well , in our city , in the age of volunteers , you have to be quite early on , you have to be very early in the age of <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers of the <unk> , and i had pretty good opportunity .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> <unk> and find out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with <unk> , which was certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> , <unk> under a screen outside in the cabin <unk> during her house .
the other volunteers who came up to me was , &quot; we call him blank luther -- we call him blank luther -- first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , which is now for the rest of his life who could tell people that he was going into a <unk> house to save a living thing , just because he was faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a couple of shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hope was , but i went -- the hallway that goes up to the hallway , which is over that time with the real <unk> , at that time , at that time , at this point , was pretty done to get a few shoes .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met my <unk> and the dog .
we put them out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his lot more attention was getting more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , they received a letter of the <unk> in which she was looking for the brave use of our house .
it &apos;s a lot of what kindness may : somebody had brought her some shoes .
and in robin hood , as i spoke to robin hood , as well as i volunteer when i volunteer , i &apos;m looking at generosity and kindness in a very large scale , but i also see power and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room in this room , and i see people who are either going to be able to succeed , or on your way , i want to give you a good memory , i want to offer it .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you &apos;re going to give it .
use them in a <unk> room where you put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will be an opportunity to save a human life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going back from a community that knows the secret of the death of humanity .
a place where the women lead to the <unk> , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the <unk> river .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the prize .
during the chimpanzee , in the chimpanzee , fear of large , fear are led by <unk> females .
they really get up there , because this leads to a <unk> society where lethal violence has not been observed in .
but unfortunately bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live in the depths of the world &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just hard to get access to it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but the heart of a violent debate , which has been in decades of a violent argument that has been used for decades , and almost so many lives of the world war ii .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that those destruction is at risk at risk .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> lead that you don &apos;t even have a stadium with <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear you laugh at the trees , the trees .
who are the relative ?
we know as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos of the bonobos have more than <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s a game essential for engaging with connection and the care of tolerance .
this is what we learn and the rules of the game .
play increased creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about energy production -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , variety of connections .
and if you &apos;re watching bonobos at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human communities , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images out of the wild .
first of all , <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
it could be the evolutionary origin of this , &quot; you put him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think i love it , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are distributed , both in both bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , and also , as the game is a game and <unk> , and also , as the game is a game to <unk> as well .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of them are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays <unk> with water .
i think exactly how you &apos;re going to play it alone , and we &apos;re <unk> limits up our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us research that makes us research and interact , and the unexpected innovation that we form is the real land of creativity .
this is just a smaller <unk> on the insights , the bonobos in our past and present .
but it also also is a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to greater challenges , through bigger creativity and information to cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s crucial .
for bonobos , for bonobos and people are equally made of your teeth and claws alone .
right now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe it seems to be <unk> .
and therefore , my favorite thing , let &apos;s give you this gift of evolution and play together , as we play the creativity of <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , at the same time , at the same moment , every single time , every single baby &apos;s baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every baby , a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to do too much time , because if you think about the whole time , you can &apos;t listen to me at all .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm <unk> <unk> , which hits the <unk> chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm , is the sperm that hits the <unk> of the <unk> .
they both are <unk> , both of the light .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people .
i have two hats , i have two hats .
i &apos;m looking at the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studying a studied , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s the human body , the animal , animal body -- as they <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , as they thought about body .
and the other hat i carried in my work is the activist as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as i say , when sometimes i say , as impatients , by people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were a lot of times as usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender are <unk> -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the kinds of <unk> , which is not the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> <unk> , the <unk> gene , that we &apos;re all going to grow towards testes .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are at the palm of stage testosterone .
but because this individual is missing up to the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no response to it .
as a consequence , the body has more of the typical female effects .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until she reaches the puberty and grow their breasts and develop their breasts , but you can &apos;t get her period until someone &apos;s coming up to a little bit different .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , it carries testicles in itself , and you have a y y .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies to call it <unk> .
it &apos;s in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> that are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i think -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t think i &apos;m probably the typical rule -- most women as i actually talk about <unk> .
we produce superstar companies , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
and the consequence is that somebody as i actually have a brain , that there was more <unk> , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not only in the middle of the spectrum of the spectrum of their gender -- in a sense , they can be distributed over the whole range .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got the phone call one 19 years ago who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he just found that he was <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> was so powerful that they created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , the <unk> <unk> became male male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody saw something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he &apos;s <unk> , that the doctors found that the doctors found that he was inside the female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this type of body -- it &apos;s <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- if surgeons are often adapted to the norm , not because surgeons would be adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason for them often made different interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic level goes with a certain identity .
so we &apos;ve got the concept that a woman is going to be a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be supposedly , an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this terrible idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different , and that &apos;s confused with us in terms of this <unk> .
so we have lots of romantic ideas about <unk> <unk> .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen the most of the excitement in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , her gender at the <unk> world cup in berlin .
a lot of journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what test you are going to do that tells us whether <unk> female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
now , we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not going to say that nature is not going to be pulling out between male and female and <unk> and <unk> ; we are that that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , which is what they say as well .
so , we have a situation , where the further our science progresses , we have to admit that these categories that we have kept in stable anatomical materials that have been <unk> <unk> , which are very simple <unk> , a lot of <unk> than we &apos;ve imagined .
and it &apos;s not only about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , as it turns out as a lot of more complicated than we have allowed us .
at our observation , we get into all sorts of different areas .
for example , we push to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we only differ by a few <unk> ?
while we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly in a zone , where we have to recognize the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see that we see that in the world &apos;s culture , in our current culture , in today , is the conversation about the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what point is a body to human beings , so that it &apos;s a different thing as fetal life .
we &apos;ve been very difficult today -- perhaps not so public in medicine -- about the question about when somebody &apos;s dead .
our ancestors used to have never been able to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they just kept a feather under the nose , and when they moved to it , she didn &apos;t bury it .
if they didn &apos;t move more , you buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today , where we take people <unk> organs and take them to others .
and as a result , we got us at the fight with the really difficult question when somebody &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories like that .
now , you might think that the whole crash didn &apos;t make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , i &apos;m nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , is tense .
and it makes me tense about thinking that democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to do first that i &apos;m a big fan of fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know that they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which what they were doing is that i &apos;ve got to look at the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what we have happened with the <unk> .
the fathers were from my view of my view , which is why that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember our fathers were the concept of the monarchy the hurdle , and the monarchy was taken in a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
<unk> of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had had the political power to have these political power , because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to father to son and so on .
the founding fathers back this idea back , and they were simply replaced it through a new concept , and this concept said that all the people were <unk> .
they <unk> the field playing <unk> , and decided that <unk> that cared about common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
so they did that part , because they were part of a <unk> system , in the two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations <unk> , and meadows things , like an supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of aid is based on a very <unk> basis .
and they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it did they managed to be a concept that was a concept that has been common .
and so it has really been prepared for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for that ?
for example , the women who used the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the fathers that says that anatomical is more important than the anatomical difference , and they said , &quot; that we should not have a uterus and <unk> , the right , the right , to full citizenship , etc . , etc . &quot; etc . &quot;
and women do successfully succeed .
next , the successful civil rights civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are more different color , which are in anatomical areas of anatomical differences , again , again , successful .
we &apos;re looking at the same thing at <unk> .
of course , the problem is , and we start looking at the similarities , and we start to look at the similarities , we need to start asking why we sustain certain things .
now , you mind , i want to sustain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish for a fish like a human one .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to sex with sex or get married .
so there are some anatomic things that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we should think of .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it and why it makes sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been <unk> in the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 on the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , she was born on the one june in 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , is born by <unk> , so he &apos;s born by the one march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months <unk> , would get all kinds of rights three months before henry -- the relatively <unk> sex , the right to choose to choose the right .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of birth .
we &apos;re finding other ways of what their rights are .
<unk> , because he assumes that he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s going to be male , because you think that he &apos;s male , he can be going to be <unk> , what maria &apos;s not worried .
maria , in the other states , not in all states can &apos;t see the same right , the mother in all states in all states , and to marry this .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have the permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways to be problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science is going to do this progress in the anatomy that we have to admit to that we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science is on its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems to be a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to take a line somewhere , and so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas at a point decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y y .
now , in practice , people aren &apos;t tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream talk .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t say , &quot; your skin , but after the property of their character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are you judged people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people so , because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of golden adhesive that probably are more beneficial than some people i know .
i want to give you a <unk> that i &apos;m probably seeing some bright <unk> , which are more intelligent , more intelligent and more mature decisions than some of their sexual relationships than some <unk> i know .
so how do we <unk> the question for the properties of character ?
it turns out as a really difficult .
and part of me wonder , what if the content is a personality that would be something that could be done in the future , which could be done by an fmri ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to think about questions about questions about democracy .
in our services around democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do it well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it &apos;s in iran , where a man who feels in their own men , is being punished with death , it &apos;s been punished by death , because he &apos;s going to be able to do a <unk> in which case he may remain alive .
and the states of these things exist in us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , which had a few <unk> twins who had <unk> in order to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i went to him , and he asked him why he did these surgeries -- it was his answer -- it was his answer to the world that children would be very badly treated , and therefore he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , did they consider political asylum , rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without changing the state .
so i think we must be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve been talking very much about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look like , or looked like we had the mothers involved more involved .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and that &apos;s what i think is that there might be different kinds of insights that are <unk> from different species of animal anatomy , when people are using a <unk> .
since years , because i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways , how they think and acting in the world .
what we &apos;ve experienced from <unk> studies is that women , in average , but on average , but on average , are more complex social relationships and care about people that are vulnerable to become vulnerable , very much attention .
and that &apos;s why we think about this , we &apos;ve got an interesting situation in front of us .
and years ago when i did a graduate student , i asked me one of my favorites that was my interest in feminism -- i watched as a feminist , so it still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what he &apos;s female is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is going to <unk> it about gender , that &apos;s why the feminism is not not female .
but the more i was thinking about his question , so i thought it could be a little <unk> in feminism .
this is to say it might be something , in average , the average of the male brains are different from the male brains of <unk> social relationships for <unk> social relationships for <unk> .
so , where the founding fathers were very <unk> had been protected as individuals in front of the state , it &apos;s possible that when we &apos;re able to protect more mothers in this concept , we can &apos;t just protect how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we have to go on anatomy -- less about the individual body -- less about the individual bodies to think of identity and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a human connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , to every opportunity to try to find a different <unk> of crazy outfit , to take a <unk> outfit , and photographed in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and it &apos;s also on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for serving my dollars is usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it &apos;s shopping to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week at ted week .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
so <unk> for a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve got bet that i want to wear all other things that i would want to wear if i just came to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have heard of me as the woman who here at ted in their underwear in their underwear , that means that i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;m really going to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to leave you some of the lessons that i do , whether you believe it or not , from this <unk> , not to carry new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has got me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : <unk> becomes totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time to try to try to be able to be myself and adapt to me at the same time .
be just who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not only going to understand them , they &apos;re going to value it .
wednesday : give your inner child .
sometimes people say , i would be able to get out , as if i dress up , or i remember their seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize the moment for them .
if you believe it &apos;s inside and the outside , you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> match everything .
and finally , saturday : a personal , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without telling a word .
and it was always proven to me and again , when people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate it all over .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn itself is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to make these things too emotional , because the corner is always going to give you a very <unk> , more <unk> , <unk> outfit that just waiting for me to love , and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy , and every boy in italy , but the reason why i &apos;m going to show you this thing in the formula one in the past decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver , and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , these days , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , like this one -- something like this -- it has a few thousand sensors in real time , and it &apos;s going to pass it back to the system of the system , and then they use them to send it back to this car , and they &apos;re going to make things back in real time and change things in real time .
this would be , in <unk> , called a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consists of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what today is interesting today is the most interesting thing that is starting to come up in our lives .
our cities were in the last few years , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they get to computers in free .
and as computers in free , you start to react in other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we &apos;ve got cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the land , but 50 percent of the world population there are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , it pulls out this sense , and it pulls in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli : for moma later , as the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this changes radically the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo was being the moses shaped , it &apos;s called the moses and he had him at moses , and i &apos;d still see him in moses , and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
well , today , our environment , the very first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to track our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that sense .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it was formed four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done there was actually a new kind of network of network that was used in the world -- this is a <unk> -- and this is a <unk> -- and <unk> information from this network that are just collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was in italy for italy , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won &apos;t .
now you can see what happened that day , only when the activity is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , before play .
you see the <unk> .
the end of the afternoon , people here and there to make the calls and move .
the game begins in -- silence .
france &apos;s making a gateway . in italy , in italy .
<unk> , people make a quick call , go to toilet .
second <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
first phosphorus , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to celebrate .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , they all went to the center to meet the prime minister and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the image of the space of space , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see a big party , and you see the rash of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
even a different example of feeling , you know , it &apos;s not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know all about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows them all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so , in fact , we &apos;ve actually designed some little markers to pursue the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we started with a year ago , something more than a year to tag the things that they have <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you &apos;ll just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands in the trash and start tracking it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
of seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day , that the cup we throw out , it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw away every day .
and if we would show that people , we can push a behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague on mit , <unk> <unk> , could be able to see a lot more about that , and the many wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to the second part that we &apos;d like to talk about the first part , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
and it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us and said that spain and <unk> a beautiful tradition in public places , in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a <unk> age , they have been able to do these tubes in front of these tubes and the valves , <unk> , which open up and close .
they cause something like a <unk> <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall off , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them <unk> as you can see on this picture .
well , we presented the mayor <unk> .
it really made him .
and we got a mission to design the <unk> of the nest entrance .
we called it <unk> the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach him , it will open up and let them go in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy when you want to reduce this , you can even reduce the roof .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to know , you know , these days , if you get the roof , you get the roof of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t get the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the sensors that open the water that opened the water .
well , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped working .
but in fact , it was more fun in this night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections of it .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have small helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that you saw earlier , which is moved with others , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , but infrequently , which is changing what changes , the light is not the position of <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine that the screen could appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud from <unk> , which you can go to , and move through that they can look at them from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , which is a <unk> v to shape like a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on it , it looks like that , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are run .
it could be a impulse to a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so forth .
i want to show you something to all of you .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in milan in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as momentum .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time , and a <unk> .
so that you can understand the movement .
they can do it all the time .
but then , if we &apos;re all <unk> , you can play with the color and gravity and play with color .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a sense of momentum for <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics for the olympics .
it &apos;s called a cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re looking at people with something to do something and change the environment -- almost like something that we call out <unk> how we call a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a small donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing of the events that happened last years , the last few decades is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized all of us , knowledge , and makes it accessible to the internet .
now , for the first time , we can see the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can shift from the digital world by the <unk> forces of the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this means something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be the following challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually actually engage the people in which they &apos;re collectively doing things together .
the cloud , again , cloud <unk> , in the same way , a cloud of particles is of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s an physical objects in london , but covered <unk> .
you can move in and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from down from the bottom of 2012 , the most important moments of 2012 and more than the connection to community .
so both the cloud cloud in the sky , and something you can go to the top , like london new <unk> <unk> .
you can get in .
and a kind of digital <unk> at night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people aren &apos;t separated by nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first <unk> .
myself , awe .
my heart came out , i was <unk> , while i was trying to believe what i was .
the <unk> <unk> around me almost 60 feet out of the water , and i could just wonder that that was a snowflake in a different snowflake year year .
<unk> is born as calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact with clear ways with their environment and their experience .
some refuse to give up and clinging to the bitter end , while others are not going to withstand it and <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think you think they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg melts , i put its <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it releases <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i go to my footage of this <unk> in this <unk> , as i would make portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never happen again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> of your life cycle .
a part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you to show you a iceberg that i put in <unk> in greenland .
that &apos;s very rare , in fact , you can actually witness a complete iceberg .
here you see this now .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like this is a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of this .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood towards him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , and graffiti is inevitably a more complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch .
so , we decided to say , tony -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony again .
and i just want to go again with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , it &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these machines using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard the higher <unk> and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do it .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
has someone seen the film &apos; butterfly and <unk> ?
so they communicate along the way , walk along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just just just a check of a check , and instead , i did not the slightest idea of how i should be <unk> .
i committed to the place and i committed to his brother and his father -- in the words , i &apos;m going to get a device : tony &apos;s going to say , and we &apos;ll find a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art again .
because it is a farce that somebody who carries all that in itself , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference for a few months later .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put light on any surface , and then to draw with a <unk> , which is only the negative area to be detected .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
they say all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the <unk> coming , after the <unk> , and finally , people actually do art .
but there were always a life cycle in the presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and ate her from all of my wife and we thought , &quot; well , second , if you can use a laser to control things , we should find a laser , so that <unk> can control a laser , so that we can do graffiti , that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , a year later , a year later , a lot of organization and forth , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we have <unk> the insurance doors , and in fact , there &apos;s a device to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
this was incredible .
and he &apos;s really very funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from the world <unk> -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we &apos;re <unk> and all images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re programmed to <unk> in venice , my kids were involved in venice , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the university of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a device on a <unk> , and now we have a device free , we can build the code for free , the software you can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely freely from limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
now , every paralyzed <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> before the great unveiling before the great unveiling .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew tony for the first time over seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we have his bed , so he can see out there .
we &apos;ve put a projector on a projector on a wall of the hospital .
and he went back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot .
we also had to have a lot of <unk> in the parking lot , so we were working on that as a part of the <unk> .
and at the end , he took us an email with this <unk> : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve made something drawn for seven years .
i feel that i was pushed under water , and finally , someone stepped up and my head and my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t this mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us on the shelf and we continue to develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes from a <unk> .
and somebody who has such a <unk> potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re doing that to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
think about it , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves from us .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored , when one of the early inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> thing is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that this was a april , in the city of the city of los angeles , in the city of los angeles one exhibition is an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot of the hardest representative of the federal development -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
do it -- you all do .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and had never had anything to do with <unk> , but i just surrounded me with amazing people that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should each of you , and every single day , in which you have something to do that that &apos;s going to be done . if not , when ? and if not i do , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably america &apos;s most <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like that .
you can have a farmer as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever voted .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , you know , an epiphany is typically that you &apos;re going to find it somewhere .
you go to the block and it was a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was <unk> in the <unk> green and blue , to a teacher to saved my life .
and she saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they did secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco -- and i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i found it in <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , my wife who said , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to know as adults .
please get to ohio , please come to ohio , and please come together with the man that i know that they &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i have <unk> , and i want you to get you a hurry . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we took them , and we gave them eight , and we gave their family eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who had to know me as adults , to know me , he turned it into a box full of ashes and was laid into my hands .
what happened was that the circle closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she &apos;s saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs everything the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is a lot of mentioned here .
he needs the same thing -- it would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
now , imagine a big explosion , while they &apos;re on a thousand feet up .
imagine a airplane full smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them on the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine on the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches off the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most important words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was <unk> to end .
i want to tell you three things that i learned about me on this day .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s all different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to raise a hand , and i didn &apos;t know , all the fences that i wanted to do is all the experiences i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine we are , and the person &apos;s there , i open it .
i never want to move more in life .
and this urgency , this goal , it really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was , when we had the george washington bridge , so much around the <unk> , so i thought , a person , there &apos;s one thing i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to become better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been given to my ego .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time that i wasted things for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t have <unk> for two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and in the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing into 20 parts of how you know it from a documentary .
while we cut <unk> , i had this feeling , a human being , not terrifying .
almost like we were preparing our life for our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really really happens in one thought , which is that i just wish to do one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
one month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
not yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , all of the sense of me was making sense .
i realized , at the time , by connecting the dots , that it was just about being a great father .
more than everything , everything , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was the miracles that didn &apos;t die on this day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and come to life .
my call to everybody who &apos;s going to fly today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they cut them , because they think they would be forever there ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
and the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want the bomb to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can do the systems to <unk> the systems that can control and valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with this centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop system , which is used by a laptop store , which is used by a <unk> box , and we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning of <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> went into the gray box , hitting the centrifuge , and <unk> the iranian <unk> logged .
it &apos;s a very easy thing to do , right ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we began to <unk> our research at six months ago , completely unknown , which is the sense of meaning and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew about is very , very complicated , which is the <unk> part , the <unk> part , he did by myriad <unk> failures .
and it seemed to be <unk> with these gray boxes , these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we got our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> , like a <unk> , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that doesn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve experimented with different kinds of cheese , i went to me that this is a <unk> attack .
complete on a particular destination .
the <unk> <unk> is active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to infect it on this goal .
and if it doesn &apos;t , don &apos;t do anything .
so that was really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power plant , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what is the goal .
so , <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s in two digital warheads in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack it .
presumably , they knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you heard that the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like outmoded <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart from this code .
so what we were looking for as first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this cause .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this up with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or <unk> .
to make these theories , let &apos;s remind us that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to act in iran , because most of the infections were reported .
well , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
basically , it goes out on top power nuclear power power , and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and i &apos;d called her knowledge to compare their expertise in the code , and we found out the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> into connection with the <unk> .
the rotor is that this is this moving part within centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this system , you &apos;re actually able to crack the velocity , and then you can actually crack down the rotor of rotor , and eventually , going to explode .
and what we &apos;ve also discovered is that the goal of the attack actually was to make it slow and scary -- obviously , to make <unk> disabled , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get behind it quickly .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of that by watching us very , very data and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> <unk> is very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started using scientific literature , like these <unk> in <unk> , and found it found that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that makes sense , it fit together .
and it &apos;s got better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 levels .
and guess what we found in the library ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied .
now , you don &apos;t understand me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks .
and often we were just running into a dead end and to collect us .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality is reality and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and apply the rotors for the rotors and slowed the rotors and it slowed up and the big <unk> moves with six <unk> into interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- <unk> me out of it .
there is the gray box , and there &apos;s the gray box , and you see the <unk> .
well , what this thing does is that it makes the values of sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides <unk> code that &apos;s still on the <unk> , which is running with the wrong layer of energy .
and actually , this <unk> fuel data has been taken from <unk> data before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not only that <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where one human <unk> can &apos;t respond quickly enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the big ice works too quickly , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk is at risk , really bad things happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither <unk> , it &apos;s not the <unk> .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do specifically with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , it would work as well -- in a power station , or in a power station .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> , how we &apos;ve seen it at <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the consequence we need to ask us .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the causal environments .
we have to ask us the consequences and we start preparing better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there was a lot of them saying that people think the <unk> behind it is .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
otherwise , our problem is even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
and i spent the last few years to place in situations that are usually very difficult and very hard .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a fighter -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat , nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little hard at the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career today to prevent situations , and that &apos;s just to look at the way that you &apos;re compelling and very interesting to try and look at some kind of understanding what they &apos;re compelling for the audience and more fun .
so when i knew that i would come here to look here to a tedtalk in a tedtalk and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i took an ad ago a few weeks ago .
i would send out some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility of <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , received a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to get a title of the talk , which is not a title of a title , and not a lot of evidence of what the subject would actually be .
so what you got was this : her name is : her name : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be the subject , and they finally ended up to fly the ears , especially if i took your company stupid for their involvement .
but more than that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me to have a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work in , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve done some pretty terrible situations in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could be ready , nothing could be able to do with something like that hard and dangerous as to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from the top to the end to the end , from the end to the end , all in the end to the end , the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
so this was more toward the accent .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x <unk> , but we &apos;ll be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every kind of category in the movie .
we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car they &apos;re at the danger of &quot; the <unk> drink , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring it to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the movie is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , all the film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy to do if <unk> would help happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because it has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet it , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case to address some of the things .
who knows when the film comes out , we may see like a tribe of <unk> .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a hard thing about this ?
jk : both .
so , it means not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do .
there are some places that we can apply .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera from &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant in reality , &quot; we want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just how all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no thing wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising is , the idea of advertising , your product as well as possible to present it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and ancient media and the <unk> media and the <unk> media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting thing that the masses brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake .
that would be no problem at all .
that would be okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency at the world theory , that &apos;s one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- based on deception and <unk> , to discover and understand it , to understand it , and it &apos;s understandable to information , especially to information , particularly , which is the last line -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re doing a lot of transparency about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes from that , it has been implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of <unk> -- like this strange bear , who still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s really risky .
what else else ?
a whole dish , cool <unk> .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell you that story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was caught in lying -- and there &apos;s a look at me , and i looked at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are every story three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s just a company , one agency was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i had to do john <unk> and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , and i had to go straight to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand becomes understood , a broad problem .
i have friends that make large , gigantic <unk> <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> as i do .
and my friends , the big ones , a large one , massive <unk> , say that the reason their movies are so successful , the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends who do a little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , giant formation ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what are we going to see in the film ?
whenever i do me on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see ban <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are they fresh enough for this interview ?
are you going to do ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so , maybe you should give a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you will have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well for women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you an emergent frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like the other brands .
so do these things -- you know , people remembers ban -- that &apos;s somehow why we &apos;re interested in .
what describe to you ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under the <unk> .
so we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really to do something positive , unlike &quot; fight and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love fun clothes .
&apos; 80s <unk> hits <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think it &apos;s a <unk> , the style i &apos;ve got , &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many <unk> and so a stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or one jewelry and one stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
a man two : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
a woman 2 : part hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
boy : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be able to be the <unk> , but i often see the interface of the <unk> interface and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could come into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for them , they could help me .
you brought their images , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live -- like people who live around -- like people who are the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from a place , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what connection is this thinking and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do they do ?
what is the <unk> ? what &apos;s you currently in ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you that are not them .
which other players have gone through ?
it doesn &apos;t have to be scared . what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be going on .
and there went a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> are two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
so , that &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , instead of both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , and that they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they turn them into something positive , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands act like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , has mini mini <unk> and <unk> .
well there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask you to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would you be ?
they have a <unk> ? are you something that brings blood into <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s slightly quiet , more quiet , more conservative ?
these are things that are things that are playful , fresh things like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , profane , delicious , magical , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are it established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate ?
is it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , stable , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
over the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 <unk> who were willing to give up on these control to try to give people as attentive and playful like me , to tell us to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally have to tell stories -- stories that would never support a research team .
and they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using these days to <unk> the <unk> of the brain , both advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city for five years , it &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school where companies are going to form their way into impoverished schools , in all america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects i got to get the most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and this is what these brands did .
because they were <unk> the <unk> , they negotiated the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really be interested in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is to think that our view of the world .
and what was it ? what it was successful ?
now , there &apos;s the film called the movie festival first , we can look at this .
<unk> was the debut in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there &apos;s 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually only a period of two and two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film has been not <unk> .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which almost every time we talked about , who we were talking about , their clients who recommended your fingers .
something that i realize is that when you try to arrest your chance , if you arrest the chance to take risks that in these risks .
i think when you get people from it , you get them closer to the failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid risks , you know the whole company is prepared to get a profit .
i feel the feeling that we have to encourage people to take risks to take risks .
we need to encourage people , not fear of people who might be <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
&quot; you welcome the fear . say the risk .
a large spoon is full of , we &apos;re welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it &apos;s a bit of honesty .
and this said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you &apos;re going to welcome transparency , &quot; you &apos;re showing transparency from my good friends from <unk> to <unk> a <unk> for ebay .
big data will be turned into large opportunities in the world .
<unk> shows , &quot; call transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what happens to the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , displayed on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude , to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i went to <unk> something to museums and art , my favorite ones who are today , i gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and access to their access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t get me -- but i had a lot of museums , and i didn &apos;t have access to this art .
and then when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i was trying to do this yearning -- art accessible -- to make technology together .
and then we put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
you &apos;re just going to be <unk> .
you can look around here in all the museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh .
i actually come into one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come to two ways , very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re going to go and love .
you want to orient up in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just on . a lot of fun .
go through .
thank you , but the best is coming .
so i &apos;m in front of my <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who really care about art , can click here -- but i click it now .
this is one of the images that we captured with the so-called <unk> .
for example , for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy . his expression is priceless .
but then you want to really go deep .
and so i started playing around to play , and i realized that there &apos;s something .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i noticed slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit of a little known at the met with a couple of known at the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a goose beat on a stick .
it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to go really close to you , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview of the point , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s leave you quickly to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
the previous example of the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s just when you want to see , like van gogh this masterpiece to this masterpiece ?
you go in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite image , until i &apos;m really going to do it .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s many other , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
every one of you , everybody -- is the same or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and go online in your own museum -- from all these images , you can get your own collection of collection .
simple , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put everything with comments , send your friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when they look at this masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they think not even from museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art and they represent <unk> .
the biggest question that i asked me is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in two camps .
this is the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we could have a scale to measure the oil reserves , we could represent your brain .
for example , this is somebody that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you move your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been interested in one of these extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , the brain is something like this -- with a high <unk> , which is in both <unk> at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or whatnot .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , together with most other experimental environments that need a good share of logic to put together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and look like it , and then look like it , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years , is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can think odd sound about it , that one thing at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , but they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember to see a child playing on a <unk> .
he was another toddler , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that it taught me to play a very valuable lesson with a very valuable lesson , which is great things not just leave you , and they stay on a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with their particles , imagine all sorts of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be in two different places .
and so they all write those observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the physics of the physics a few years ago to describe the little tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t needed them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this is not like my intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side of this didn &apos;t like it .
because if all things are made of particles , and all these particles are going to follow the quantum quantum quantum mechanics , then not just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that &apos;s not supposed to be so .
so i would make him <unk> <unk> to the whole thing , if we could show that <unk> also follow the quantum mechanics .
so i made it a couple of years ago , right ?
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
this is what i zoom into this . we look at the center here .
and here is a very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool of <unk> hole and getting the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the world &apos;s ability to be able to be <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it &apos;s going to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m going to make all kinds of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go to other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want them to bother , or , frankly , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are the same .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only humans , but the light that seems to be on them and the wind that seems over <unk> and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , this piece of metal behaves , we had to put out the whole <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we made the light off , we put it into a vacuum , and <unk> it all the air , and it &apos;s <unk> it to almost just in the elevator , was the piece of metal , the piece of metal , whatever it wanted to do .
so we measured his movement .
and we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead , it &apos;s just there , it &apos;s just there , it &apos;s a little bit of it , it &apos;s kind of like it &apos;s kind of like this -- like a <unk> and together <unk> <unk> .
where we gave him a little push , we could vibrate in order to vibrate at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows you to vibrate in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what i really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms are sitting there are still sitting there , and the same time move the same atoms and down .
just precise <unk> , she agrees .
the rest of the time they are <unk> .
that means each atom at the same time is at two different places , which is what the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth it for all this year , in the clean space , because , you check this , the <unk> between one atom and this piece is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if you can be a single atom at the same time in two different places that can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you have it ?
i mean , that &apos;s what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at a couple of places , how would that feel like that ?
how would you deal with it that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop these new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact just <unk> objects that are in a small space in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections around them , literally define who they are , and this is the <unk> and <unk> of the quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal to think that when families think about where they &apos;re living and work , you want to pick up the opportunity between at least one hand full of different cities that all in competition is all in the competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there &apos;s billions of people in the developing world that don &apos;t even have a single city that they &apos;re welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more valuable than it costs them .
so we could do the world very easily with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
that sounds like absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they just trade the building of homes on the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , this is already ; the other half yet .
and they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;d like to be about to do , in these homes , and their environment and their environment , to avoid complaints and <unk> from <unk> .
so it turns out as hard to keep out of all this extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place to go to a completely new pig , as provided the laws there would support such a building and not <unk> it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments can create new surfaces that have enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , <unk> and <unk> on the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , over 75,000 times their country , in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , and they wanted to know what they could do in your country and can be able to do the same in honduras .
at this point , <unk> said , &quot; what happens to <unk> , &quot; what happens when we have a <unk> area of our country , and if we &apos;re just going to get a message from the canadian <unk> and the united states , and the united states , you can work there , and the united states , you can do it all the field of the united states , what they usually would do to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer , in the summer of in 2009 , under a severe <unk> .
the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program both innovations , and <unk> .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i gave me a talk at tedglobal .
so by improvement , try and try and through the study of consumers , i &apos;m trying to try to reduce the complicated concept of <unk> city on which are essentially taking elements .
the first point is the importance of law , laws that determine that you can &apos;t care that you can &apos;t care about existing <unk> .
we &apos;re going to pay new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually for laws to help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala <unk> <unk> to the tedtalk .
and it showed him <unk> .
and they were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give that the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of an hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to do a lot of how valuable cities are much more valuable than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable interest is in a place like new york , and think that there is a space in some cases per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion in a place when there was a pause , and there was <unk> , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk introduced in very simple shape that a <unk> city is a place where the laws of the rule are going to be there , which is the laws that are given there , and people provide the ability to choose either of those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we have to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to be our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was asked to keep a talk at the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve been given another with some facts that has been a graphic like this involves a graph like this , which is trying to make a lot of value in a city , it needs to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and this sketch is the new airport that was built in <unk> .
that airport alone has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you to make a new city , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area from least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
well , well , polite , all of them .
the faces of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
the director of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the statement that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the possibility of a city to live in honduras , and rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also makes new opportunities for leaders .
and the leaders of the government would rely on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , which they &apos;re going to bring from the laws of this charter and engage that everybody is able to trust that the charter is really enforced .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> was going to come here and build this city for all the parties to build this city for all parties in honduras , which has been scared and mistrust .
we &apos;ve been in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s got a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they voted on congress for a change of the constitution , which is for special <unk> .
in a country that has a heavy crisis behind it , has been elected in congress for a voice to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , but it has to be authorized by congress twice by congress .
on the 17th of february 17th , there was <unk> to a voice of <unk> to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> in the world that most of the world was most interested in the world &apos;s business in the business of <unk> .
it &apos;s a place in south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban slum in south korea , built in south korea as the core <unk> .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
there were two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a <unk> , and you already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that <unk> allows , and it &apos;s also working on an external law .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide a dish for the <unk> appeal of <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested in .
they actually bring funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been understood , there are many <unk> .
there are a lot of businesses who would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who like to live there .
all over the world there are 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to live in a different place .
a million people leaving latin america and go into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to be their families to <unk> their families , sometimes they have an individual mothers who need enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes children are trying to find their parents that they have , in some cases , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen more .
so what is it for an idea to build a completely new city in honduras ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or in hundreds of these cities ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition in competition ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends who were asked me to say , thanks ted .
do you know how many decisions they do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions they make in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently made a survey on 2,000 americans , and the average number of choice , the <unk> of choice is a typical americans on a day is <unk> .
and recently a study was made with ceos in which she saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the various subjects , and i &apos;ve been working on the ceo , and how much time they relate to decisions that relate to issues .
and they found that one of the average ceo are busy in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues was , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were going to be within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of your decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you do in the nine minutes of people who are an hour category ?
how good , do you think are it doing that ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , only if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you when i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a nasa university at stanford university , i went to this very very <unk> convenience store ; at least it was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time we &apos;ve actually drinking even <unk> .
i &apos;ve loved it to do that business , but i &apos;ve asked me at one point , well , how do it come to you ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had over 75 different types of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes , who came from a thousand years .
so i decided to go to the leading day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model , that you really do all of those possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists who came every day and usually their cameras had had .
and we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve set up a little video tag directly at the entrance at the entrance .
we &apos;ve got six different flavors that we put six different tastes or 24 different flavors and put 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve got two things , first , i would be looking at two things and try to try <unk> ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than if there were six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what people would buy a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who stayed , when they were 24 , they &apos;d actually bought a glass of <unk> .
from the people who stayed when it was six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do it , people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who they had six times a glass when they had 24 to their choices .
now , if you don &apos;t choose a glass ticket , probably for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that we &apos;ve also affected us with very sophisticated decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it comes against our own interests .
so the theme of the day , financial savings are saving .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were looking at about 650 plans for almost a million americans in the united states .
and what we looked at was was whether the number of <unk> , which were a half of the <unk> , which has been possible to be able to be saved by the probability of being saved by tomorrow .
and we found out that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that in fact , in fact , the participation was lower .
now , if you &apos;re now looking at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , had a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered nearly 60 fund , the <unk> now fell on about <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate in <unk> , even if more possibilities are , even it has negative consequences .
so , the people who participate decided that the more possibilities you were available , the more <unk> they were saving her stocks and fund .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they put their whole money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , is the decisions that somebody would recommend if you think your future resources is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential consequences of people who are able to provide more negative consequences and more choices .
they push the decision -- push on , even if it comes against their own interest .
they make more inferior decisions -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they tend to decide to make them less content , even if you make an objective better better .
and the main reason for this is that we might be able to enjoy this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we actually couldn &apos;t move to compare to compare and well , and then actually something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways -- that they &apos;re just tested in their business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true for true that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry that they lose <unk> .
but in fact , we can see it increasingly , and more , if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and then there &apos;s an increase in sales , and then there &apos;s an increase in sales , it &apos;s reduced to the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement improvement .
as a <unk> and gamble and gamble of the different head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 , you &apos;ve experienced an increase of sales .
when the golden village corporation her were sold for 10 at the worst of the worst , she was experiencing that the profit around 87 percent -- a result of the two , the increase of two , and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average director today gives you 45,000 products .
you have a typical walmart today to give you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is today <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they provide them quite 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples of the market has recently gone to the time , how to <unk> the choices , something that david <unk> has very strong , and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff takes automatically in a <unk> part .
the ones who want to make a choice , are 20 fund , are 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to be limited .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t be able to be able to get them <unk> , it can &apos;t . &quot;
now , before we have lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to pay to all people in this audience to give to the most beautiful road to the most beautiful street .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read them to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read , and then i &apos;m going to clap you , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
is that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , they &apos;ve learned that the first time we had more information when the second time , but i would be able to make it to what they think it &apos;s in the second time .
because the images had made it real for them .
and what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that has to feel that the consequences of the consequences of the consequences .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more than 30 percent more , if you use a <unk> or a card card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really be a real money .
and it turns out that if you create it that something feels a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people who worked on <unk> -- and these people were all working in a meeting in which they were signed to their participation for their own cans .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting exactly as it was always as it was , only we &apos;ve added one little more .
the little thing that we &apos;ve got to do is that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives that would happen in their lives when they save money .
we did that simple thing , there was an increase in part of participation around 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or one rise to four percent the amount they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
so , for example , this is a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out that it turns out in the northeast area , and down in the northeast area , the number of ancient different types of magazines has been highly motivated to be highly motivated .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and i put them into 10 categories , or i put them in 10 categories , and you think that i &apos;ve given them more choices and a better <unk> , when i had given them for 400 categories , when i had given them 600 people .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of types .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> and the display on the right , then they clap into the hands .
okay , there are a couple .
if you think that that &apos;s on the left of jazz , and that , on the right-hand side , is <unk> , you clap , please .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and ones on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> .
the categories have to say something that provides a choice of choice .
and this is often a problem , when you look at the long list of all of these fund .
who do you actually get informed by that ?
so the fourth technology for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information with more information than we think we just have to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
this is a german photographer who gives you the opportunity to give her car to <unk> themselves .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
now , these decisions differ in the number of choices that provide a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the sequence of decisions .
half of the clients is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> practices to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients are going to go from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 diseases , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how cares about it .
if you use the <unk> of the decision , that means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that the people who are going to go from many to the low <unk> and over and over again , they are choosing .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence in that information .
so if i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning like i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gears choose to choose nothing about my preferences in the interior of the interior , i still choose to choose to choose .
it &apos;s also going to be excited about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to be interested in it .
let me wrap up .
so i told you about four techniques that the problem of the <unk> <unk> -- close to you -- do you put the alternative alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real than more categories , less possibilities , less ways , for complexity .
every one of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help them manage the possibilities -- good for them , you can use them for themselves , good for the people who they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you are for choice .
and the more we &apos;re more who we &apos;re choosing , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube , i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then that &apos;s why this is important .
we all want to be the stars -- celebrities , comedians , comedians -- comedians , comedians -- it seemed infinitely difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us that we all or all our creative activities can be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but on youtube , more than a <unk> hours of youtube is uploaded to the minute .
and again , only a tiny percentage of tiny percentage will ever come up and look at thousands of times , and this is the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> of this video he filmed in front park in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like it looked like the video last summer for the first time .
it actually didn &apos;t want viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that , if you &apos;re called five mountain <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what happened here ?
there were jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> &apos;s tweet that did the video last at the end of the end .
because <unk> , like jimmy <unk> , we show us new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , get down on <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of year .
it was almost 200 million times that year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like the &quot; double raindrop &quot; it seems to happen from nothing .
what has happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other tips are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j.
so important is that one person or a group of <unk> , and a group of <unk> has taken a point of view with a big audience .
then this community was formed of people who shared these big <unk> , and started talking about that .
now , there &apos;s 10,000 species of <unk> from youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a parody of every single day of the day .
unlike the ancient conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by putting it out or making it a new thing .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold this for crazy , you should know that there should be a solar system that has been looked at four million times .
even a cat look at this video .
cats are looking at cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground , which made it from a <unk> joke that we all participate in .
today we &apos;re not going to find pleasure on something , we &apos;re doing .
who could anticipate who could anticipate ?
who would have predict &quot; the &quot; double raindrop &quot; or rebecca black , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
what we have would have been able to write their writing , in which kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in which every minute of two days , there is only something really unique and unexpected <unk> like that i mentioned video .
i &apos;m going to admit , i was not very interested in when i told me a friend i &apos;d look at this great video , on a guy who went on in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i don &apos;t have a ticket , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities who don &apos;t have disabilities who don &apos;t let you go to the <unk> .
there &apos;s a very surprising and humorous , was a <unk> funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for all new things that we do .
and that all leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , is the features of a new form of media and culture that everybody has access , and the audience is defined by the audience .
as i said , one of the world &apos;s largest stars -- made his beginning with youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re also feeling as <unk> of our culture .
and these are not the features of the old media and they don &apos;t even meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk to 10 minutes about the connectedness between three generations , and like the amazing strength of this connectedness , when she had five days ago in the chinese sea , when she had five days ago in the chinese sea , and he was going to go back to a little girl in the chinese sea , and he never disappeared -- this little girl who &apos;s going to live in san francisco and now talk about you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will even put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man that &apos;s burning his <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who whole life from the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home is held together .
think of it at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he must admit that his life has been a single waste of waste .
the words , so a long time of his friends , <unk> now .
he pulled up in silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his grandmother .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to recognize us , we &apos;re going to get through it .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> silent break at the early sea .
my mother may was 18 , when her father died -- already in a gay marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had a job : the run of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely likely to fail to fail .
after a four four year-olds , <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat still in the lake , as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had her front of pirate , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little <unk> .
i &apos;d just had my sister , and i have to drink myself and i drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady <unk> of the engine , the clap of the engine , on the bug , the very large and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up with a lot of times , but <unk> of the men on our boat , or <unk> the <unk> of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start on six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the <unk> coast , and the young man who died , and he died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first <unk> that was one of the men on the platform .
no apple had ever tasted this again .
after three months in the refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations , building together a new life .
we let us go down in <unk> , one of the <unk> suburb , the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smells of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> was found between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on one line in the conveyor in a <unk> , six days , double layers .
it somehow managed to find the time to learn english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been assigned , and was put in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give . mostly , the new things , they were getting out of second hand .
two <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
it &apos;s a <unk> until the <unk> , because she had to get six years .
and there were the rare but the rare but <unk> , and here , and here , and here , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
after where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the movements of our grandmother .
my mother suffered <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night , so i could get her <unk> .
she opened a <unk> , then then a <unk> , and then a business has a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t get <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
<unk> and sponsors .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student who asked the <unk> demands of himself .
in uncertain life , i was tragic in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and tony .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of that aid , i was born in my last year , as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was being <unk> from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now tan le and social activist who had never heard of lectures , which she had never heard of , and in homes that they could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to put into a routine , and the convenience of the unknown <unk> <unk> back -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were telling each other their day and two daughters , who told each other the stories of their day and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was so old when we had climbed the boat .
no one was never a possibility .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , living on the bounds of the possible way .
and even though i finish my degree , i realized that i could not be able to buy a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture -- and not just okay , but something to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to collapse of the strike of the collapse , so it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve got enough of my computer lab to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you do it .
opportunities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be strongly <unk> .
there was an energy , a random optimism , a strange fact that strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which was not a <unk> challenge .
we had no cents for a year .
at the end of one day , i cooked a huge bone of soup that we shared us .
we worked down to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant doing , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure left .
before i &apos;m talking about my grandmother , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , which was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was going to go alone .
with 17 , she got the second woman &apos; second woman who was struck .
without her man &apos;s man , she was worried about a <unk> by court and <unk> in their own case , and there was even bigger <unk> when they won .
&quot; turns out as a <unk> .
i &apos;m sitting in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , a thousand miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> , and i looked at the other side .
i knew she was going to go to hi .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple in <unk> , and they sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> her , that we were .
at midnight , the monk and said , he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm , and the rest of them is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she was holding it for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t stop them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through women .
you can see who we were in and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who may come in our lives would come to our lives .
that was too simple .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease before .
can i give you a bug in your life , courageous every wave , <unk> , steady <unk> of the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because it &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first camera in the age of 15 years .
i combined it with my previous predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the use of the camera was the process of planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , ends , the process , if you press the outcome .
so for me , it seemed more to be more , to go to the right place at the right place .
i believed it could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to keep when the cause of the cause .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it has a unexpected twist to turn .
and still a realistic level .
or photos like these -- dark and <unk> at the time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to give up .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i &apos;d always like to look like it , as if you could have , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea as a moment .
what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the color ?
is it about the light ?
what is the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but in the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s realistic for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and can put different pieces to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
and we have three perfectly vaccine imaginable here , that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , they put together in a particular way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine the same process .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so things that make an image realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that aren &apos;t three special images .
but combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that bringing these pictures to have the same perspective .
secondly , they should have these same ones .
and these two images meet these two demands -- from the same altitude and the same thing .
third is , it &apos;s not possible to tell you to tell you what the individual images are starting and end by creating it seamlessly .
it makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually combined .
so by putting color , contrast , contrast , and contrast on the edges of the individual images , photographic and disorders , we put together the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , even though a single photograph , even though a picture can take hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape of the landscape , and the bottom part .
but this picture is actually completely composed of different places from different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place when you find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take trade-offs with the ideas in its head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i would need for several months to plan them to do the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been recorded in a <unk> .
the bank comes from another place .
it comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island on the island of red , to make it look .
in order to get a <unk> outcome , i &apos;m going to get out out of planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of work .
and if you do good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and pretty realistic .
so these are all tools , and the only thing that limited us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic technologies have failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things we introduced to the <unk> was to make a <unk> .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific , you know , i think , a cup of coffee or tea , and ask the patients , the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the main problems -- maybe most of the electronic health system : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s a button , and it &apos;s like .
and i get it every morning .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds of them .
it &apos;s pretty simple : every time i get to the scale , you send my data on google health .
and there &apos;s where you get from my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and that &apos;s not only in the moment that i need <unk> support or so , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 pieces on twitter .
so every morning , i get my <unk> and people talk to me , before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little salad , a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could do patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to make some kind of game to play their health .
the next week comes to the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to be able to measure the people from home to their blood pressure , to send it to your doctor and share it for them , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in . you can &apos;t only take control of control , the captain on their own ship , but we can help care of the challenges of the challenges that are in front of us , and we can help care of the challenges , and the demand of healthcare , twice .
so let &apos;s do ways that are easy to use and start embracing patients in the team .
and they can do that through these ways , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around <unk> .
we know one where all petrol stations lie .
and yeah , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next sleep to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving research was at this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website and then asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , &quot; if it &apos;s a <unk> , you know , where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed as it &apos;s closed , of course .
and about 10,000 times , have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find a apps for that .
and we &apos;ve created a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone &apos;s going to go on , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can find the next <unk> , to find life .
and we don &apos;t just want to be able to do this as a result of the product , as the product is called , it &apos;s also called <unk> .
and we want to bring it to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which is about helping us to help themselves like <unk> behavior , to crowdsource of the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday and someone &apos;s going to collapse , it &apos;s your own relationships or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing , what we want to ask is that companies on all the world is helping us to help us in <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in its position .
please help us and try and try to improve health , but take it into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to share with unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and i want to force my little <unk> that we force us to do environment by ...
it &apos;s going to pay to signal .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s load .
now -- we can just skip the video -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i launched a program to get the stars in technology and design to try to take sabbatical and work in an environment , which is so much about what they actually hate , we have to work them in the government .
the program for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the geeks for the geeks .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to be working with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what today &apos;s technology is possible .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what it looks like when he looks for a date , but what he &apos;s really addiction , somebody who &apos;s really searching , someone who &apos;s really looking for him , because he knows it &apos;s not very well in the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> by one meter .
how did he come to look for this particular way of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston in boston , &quot; program for america .
they were there in february , and it has last february of <unk> .
and they realized that the city is never <unk> this fire hydrant .
but one fellow , one fellow , a man named erik <unk> , even even something else , and that was that they had the sidewalks on the sidewalks , right in front of these parts .
so he did what any good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him , if it <unk> <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take away you .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so the citizens <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle , i decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago , they just introduced them to make people <unk> when it <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re now familiar with nine cities to use that app .
and it made look forward , natural , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually go .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team who worked on a project last year in boston for three people and a half months .
it was about a way that parents can find out with parents that are the real public schools .
we told us later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would be taken over two years , and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
there &apos;s a project in the california justice system that the taxpayer has paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that is written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , it &apos;s a way of the bug on the institution to the institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- not like a private business , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly to that app is that she represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of an active institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in the collective action with digital technology .
now , there &apos;s a huge community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people all across the country that get up and writing <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but you didn &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that is , if you all forget your feelings about politics and the line in the line and <unk> all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re doing it , because the things change .
politics are not changing ; the government is change .
and because the government finally takes their strength -- <unk> you , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought there &apos;s mainly the government of the government to choose to vote .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in communities .
this is the call centers for service and information .
where you normally come out , if you &apos;re in your city in your city .
if you should ever have a chance to work in your <unk> call center , like our fellow <unk> <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that people are going to call the government for many different problems , including that there is a <unk> in your house .
so so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , look , you can just open all the doors in your house and see a loud music and see if the cattle <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban journal in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked about a human .
but in <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turn the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here the digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government gets to crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m rather talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizens , but the government was a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you would have to connect them to government performance , if these were needed , but a neighbor is going to be a far better and cheaper alternative services .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we &apos;re getting our communities .
call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is not the government .
and most people understand that , but you think that one is the input of the input .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often we have elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re expecting the government to pick up our values and we expect the government that reflects our values and then hasn &apos;t changed a lot ?
that &apos;s because the government like a further ocean , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what is that , is what we call it .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay to pay for us to be something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want the institution to work for us , we have to make the bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real thing is going on .
we have to do the government of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that wrote a very detailed <unk> report that has written an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> for the <unk> .
it &apos;s not politically active , which is active .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to give you the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really think we &apos;re going to achieve what we need to do , without improving an institution that can act in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make it possible , the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by creating society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to just build systems .
now the average average age of our fellows is 28 , so , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight , because they can talk about who can talk to you .
you can make their minds on every channel to every time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , you don &apos;t care about using their voices .
they use your hands .
they use their hands to write applications that the work of the government improved .
and using these apps of our hands to improve our communities .
it could be to be a fire hydrant , <unk> weed to <unk> , a trash with a wave of light .
and sure , we would have a <unk> <unk> all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we don &apos;t only consumers are given and receive taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government , until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i all have for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , we &apos;re all going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role of telling people how wonderful the new technologies that are the emergence of the new technologies that are going to be the <unk> , and i thought i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think about , and i &apos;m going to try to understand what &apos;s going on with these incredible <unk> , which happens so quickly that we can barely keep up .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single one , boring slide .
and , please , you might show you the slide .
this is a slide that i just chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s kind of the <unk> shape .
this slide shows an analysis of an analysis from <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide we often find in our field , which we often find in our field is a kind of <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power in the <unk> .
and this is an novelty that we need to use this guy , and we need to use this guy in the field of technology .
some very strange thing happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn to the lights .
a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
well , why do we draw graphs in technology on the <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , you know , this is a way of the technology , so this is a way of the technology that i &apos;m going to show with a graph , that &apos;s the graph that becomes a graph that becomes a graph that will be silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i &apos;re going to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , and then this is going to come down on the <unk> scale , and that &apos;s a very different line in a flat line .
but if this is what happens here , it changes the circumstances .
so , if the result of the <unk> , as fast as the <unk> progression , we could get <unk> into a taxi and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
that had never been before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which the scale is growing exponentially a few years .
the question i want to ask you is when you look at the exponential curves , you see them , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is forever and forever as fast as we &apos;ve moved .
there are two choices .
either it will be a classic <unk> , like here , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think i &apos;m going to do something like this in the way .
it &apos;s really that , then that means that we &apos;re in the right right now in a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line here , in a transition of the world in a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also think of myself , is how this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that makes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to seem to be very <unk> when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future has shrunk for a year for me to be in the world .
i think the reason is that we &apos;re going to notice that there is something underway .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make a sense of trying to try to look at 30 or 50 years to look at the future , because everything is going to be a simple model of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make a sense .
now , i want to talk about what that could be , this transition where we &apos;re in now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to a few other things about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think i can really understand this , we have to take a step back and look at it on a longer <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on the entire world &apos;s life of life .
i think the very big picture makes sense when you split it into a few wooden .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a large , <unk> <unk> with many chemicals with many chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals are organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re doing the <unk> .
and i also think there are theories like anything like everything started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story , but i &apos;m going to tell you that at this time , small species of dna , which contain different types of dna sequences of chemicals .
some of these <unk> has a special combination of chemicals that allow you to integrate some chemicals from the outside and so growing .
all of those were , started there .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about alive in the same sense of life , because each one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe by chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have spread chemicals into the very disparate amounts .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> wave grew up faster than other and more integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and more chemicals and shared faster .
so , this tended to survive longer , and they &apos;re catching into the way to be involved in the way .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is it going to be a trick in an idea of abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , you have the capacity to learn the ability to get information to information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for the cell as information , and in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have found an evolutionary way that allowed them to find a way that allowed them to be stored in <unk> , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information for 2.5 billion years where they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and every living creature uses exactly the same letters , and the same code .
we are that we &apos;re just going to be , just for the <unk> , the thing in this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> of a white <unk> that i try to keep in airports .
in it , it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code of normal letters that we use -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 .
so if somebody would want to get a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even in the world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
i would have been in reality in fact , and then i &apos;d written it on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna designer &apos;s dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , very interesting step where things were completely different , which is to communicate these cells and share information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is also why for example , the consistency grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how you can stay away from penicillin , and we &apos;ve written this information together with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate themselves .
these communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all individuals have been repeating the community more often , and the evolution of the community .
the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close to them , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities of lots of <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism is actually an organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that don &apos;t have more on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level that evolution was going on , no longer was the individual cell , but the whole thing that we call an organism .
the next step happened in this community .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that do nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the landscape of neurons that have built these <unk> .
they started train specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and making information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning is going to be in the period of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn for example , a particular act of food , because she liked sick and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now this could be in the life of a single organism , whereas before , hundreds of thousands of years , because of hundreds of thousands of years , because these information evolved to be learned by the individuals who died because of these fruit died , because these <unk> haven &apos;t exist yet .
so the nervous system has the production system in this particular process because evolution could be in an individual in an individual .
it could happen in a time of time .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms would find a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the <unk> of us known version of this system is human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
and i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically taking sound of me in the hope to create a similar idea in your mind , which has a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , it turns out in sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to have a unified organism to work again than a unified organism .
and what we actually did is we have humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we go through the same steps that have gone through the <unk> , which have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods we &apos;re presenting data .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to make this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also , also , we can continue to develop faster than we were .
so today evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> small <unk> , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so we have <unk> <unk> again .
the first steps of the story i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> several hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just to take a few decades .
the process of the process is feeding itself and will so , i think , <unk> is the word for that -- if something makes its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
i live alive from computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not to use computers without the recently made of computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead instead of doing it , and what the designers of thinking is , we think , in a sense of <unk> , that the machine and the machine makes it something far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it &apos;s part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
and a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used for the last time , is the evolution itself .
in the process , we put in the machine in the machine that &apos;s going to be going on in <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> request a hundred million randomly selected of instructions .
now , please take these randomly chosen instructions , take all the programs , and pick all the programs , and then finally , who my policy is next to the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to take numbers out , that would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been used for it .
so find programs that are most likely to make numbers out .
of course , at random , the chance of randomly chosen the instructions is very small , so just numbers just spread out a number of the instructions actually do this .
but one of them likes to have a little lucky numbers to the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of these 10 percent of the sequences , which is what my targets came to the next .
store those , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> that are the numbers who are best in charge .
and in fact , with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the features of the process of the most complex programs .
so now , i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that are something closer to the targets than others .
say , &quot; please again again . &quot;
<unk> it again .
now take some mutations one .
and try this whole one again with another generation .
only these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , a few hours , a few hours .
finally , i get programs to make the numbers perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i can have ever write of hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they are obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that do the job .
because your life depended on if they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky &apos;s <unk> , <unk> a map <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look . look .
there is , &quot; this plane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make your flight safer , don &apos;t do you ? &quot;
we know that it &apos;s not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process , which is a lot different from classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much greater complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
so <unk> <unk> &apos;s technology .
so we use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are going to feed themselves .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time , as they evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make up what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think something else is coming .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear this now before i &apos;m going to get more <unk> .
my story begins here in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the west sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the king of the ancient indian face . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back at the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing that with airplanes .
in the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the <unk> to stop the sunset , and no tweet in my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill technology .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full world full of pirates and saturated ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was like our fancy clocks and the cameras were dreaming .
they were inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how to use them to use it to do magic , rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it makes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that storytelling , really needed more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on each light . &quot;
and so -- here , &quot; this box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and it becomes a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps , from gps , where i live -- which is right to me .
and the child in me is really excited about this way .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
i always found fireflies in a glass .
so you have to blow the ipad , and it &apos;s fireflies .
and the lights on the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated by me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and this is why every book and every world is a little bit of <unk> that i prefer to get out of the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always begun , but these cards were static .
and this map grows and lighting up , and it serves for orientation , in the rest of the book .
it also shows the other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were thousands of years in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that was challenging to new issues , including the <unk> .
the issue of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that kids in their suite is that kids are sitting in their suite at their lab , without a walk .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with your technology .
in an interaction of the book , you will go to a search . you have to go out and with the camera of the ipads images of the objects .
when i had a child , i had <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to go out to a chapter from a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology together .
the next book we &apos;re planning to do an interaction that you use the video of the ipads and actually see an animation of <unk> that appear to appear on a plant in a plant .
at one point , the screen filled with leaves the screen .
you have to make the sound of <unk> , they blow the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces are going to come to the technology of technology and technology to come to come to come to come in .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and the magic , and the fun of our childhood , through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially <unk> and in places where there &apos;s lots of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to see , to see how stimulating that is , has given me very much force .
in the short time here , i became clear , ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of any teacher , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor &apos;s doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had impact .
she had the last word in every day .
it was also the point of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in virginia as slaves in virginia .
it was born in 1880 , 1880 , the experience of slavery very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
and she found me that i could barely breathe . then they left me .
one or two hours later , when i encountered her , she came up with me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no &quot; no , i said , again , when i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;d let me alone .
she was something that made that you wanted to be close to you .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her time , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins ran around .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine , i woke up in the room and the living room . all of my cousins go around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the day and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you that you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i saw you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first telling me , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you need to promise , you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
so my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; when i was next to me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who was older and younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and took this <unk> beer , and my sister and my sister and went to the forest .
we just <unk> around it like else .
and he took a drink of beer and offered to my sister &apos;s one , and she took them , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s ok . i don &apos;t want to do a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today we do that , you do anything that we do .
i had , her sister had something . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . you just do . you know . &quot;
my brother , staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , what &apos;s happening ? &quot;
and then he looked in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still do you because of the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all of all their grandchildren you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to be confess .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s because identity does .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell the people around us , you can &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we have to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people in <unk> , and in prison .
today , this is 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest oil spill in the world .
seven million people are discharged on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , we have changed our world fundamentally .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of africa , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black black black who &apos;s 18 and 30 is in prison in prison , leaving on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles , baltimore , to 60 percent of all black young men either the black young men either be in prison , in prison , go on on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
but our system will not only be shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also going through poverty .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> in this country that they treated much better when you &apos;re rich and guilty of being an arm and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , the result .
and yet , we seem to be quite happy .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments .
my home home of alabama pulls them permanently , if you were prosecuted .
and here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population <unk> their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic <unk> will be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world who sentenced children to death in prison .
in this country , there are <unk> <unk> for kids without genetic growth .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a man made to die for one of him ?
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : has someone deserves a crime , but , have we made it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we were executed , is one that we &apos;ve been <unk> for innocent and <unk> and <unk> .
one of an amazing <unk> . one of japanese innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with an airplane , when for nine planes , <unk> , a famine crashes .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking about my students african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of <unk> , until the beginning of the second of the world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now , and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to people , you tell the people that they &apos;re going to stop in history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- you tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after that terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of driven surrender , surrender and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> didn &apos;t be able to overcome the willingness without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some of the talks in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists came up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
and of course , they can never give them in germany . &quot;
and it was quite quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , we ever have to get to the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> from us , aware of people and socially . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where german state would <unk> people , especially if it was a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to make people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , when it &apos;s black , when it &apos;s black , when it is black , and the victim is , in the same states -- in the same states , in their earth , the body of <unk> people in their own .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental footprint .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> from suffering , abuse , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s important to me to unite both .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to see in a complex world .
for me , the time to build , and think about the poor , and talk about the poor , the <unk> , who are never going to be at ted .
but think in a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational , so we value the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the key thing that i think that i believe is not only open to us , not only open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great liberal politicians , once said .
when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most , but what we needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that they need to be engaged for that .
there &apos;s no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be human , and to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t take us .
it will deeply touch them .
as a young lawyer , i had the great privilege of hitting pink parks .
and then woman parks always came back to <unk> where they were <unk> two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- a white <unk> , a white man , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women came together and i just talked about .
and then , to the woman , i said to me , and said , &quot; <unk> , ms. parks coming into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do if you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just listened to .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i sat there , and after a few hours turned out to me , and after a few hours turned to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what &apos;s the same thing about the same .
what are trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> for kids without genetic footprint .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate <unk> . &quot;
i was holding my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> .
she said , &quot; this will be very , very tired . &quot;
and then he said he was <unk> to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to be ways to ask these challenges : these problems , sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
when somebody &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that &apos;s not heard it , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
and i also believe that in many parts of this country , and security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think too many places in many places , the opposite is justice .
and finally , i think that even though it is so dramatic , so it &apos;s so beautiful , and <unk> , and <unk> , we &apos;re not measured by the things that we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and mind .
finally , a society is not going to be measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but what they deal with the poor , the <unk> <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing that balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas rush ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i put these kids who had been convicted of hard presence .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client , the 13 or 14 years old , to be in court .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge someone in something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at it as adults , but i see a child .
and one night , i stayed too long , and i thought , oh my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you have to be a wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more properly , i started working at a ground .
i had a <unk> , poor young boys as a client .
and i started with that . the headline was , out to my poor , <unk> , my poor clients like a privileged , white <unk> , white <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my center , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the police as <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there &apos;s just misconduct .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know whether i dreamed of these crazy ; or actually wrote it .
and i had not just written him , but i didn &apos;t just sent him to the court .
a couple of months , and i had just forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , i decided , my god , i have to make a <unk> .
i went to the car , and i was overwhelmed with -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so heavy , so painful .
finally , i went from my car , and i went to the stairs .
when i took the staircase to the court , to the court , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; they &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was to me .
it touched a very deep thing in me , identity , the ability every single person to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i went to <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you have these crazy radio ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors from my career and go off .
he always looked through the windows and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down .
and finally , this older black man had a very <unk> man with a very <unk> <unk> , and she sat behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the break , a <unk> came in , which was struck that the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the office ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , you don &apos;t give it out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far <unk> , but that it &apos;s <unk> .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and business .
that our all survive with survival is each of their survival .
that we have our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and most importantly , i want to see those of you who just see that , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
you have in this audience , this community , you see a obvious wish , and belongs to them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a mirror in this spring , which is what it is about to actually do a effort to do something from the <unk> , something else into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , in california , you &apos;re going to get a billion dollars for the death penalty for the death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> doesn &apos;t stop with a <unk> .
56 percent of all people don &apos;t come before .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is suggesting that money to invest money in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the dna epidemic is extremely down in america .
and that &apos;s the fact that they &apos;re going to be asked in a context of elevated <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find it in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come in prison .
we have <unk> <unk> from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> <unk> that people are going to be behind bars for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft of good , instead of them forcing them to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current risk is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they &apos;ve really brought a string on here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
if bin laden &apos;s death has an increased <unk> of mine .
two : famine in somalia , famine . speaker gave three : o.c. spray .
4 : malignant growth . speaker speaker would be dangerous .
six : social decline . citizen : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . speakers 9 : <unk> <unk> .
different speakers . weapons of mass destruction . tornado .
recession , gridlock . <unk> . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of these clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds have exactly to be attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second every second every second , our senses can ever process more information in than our brain .
and because we have nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our core distribution to the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> system , our <unk> .
in addition , and <unk> the whole information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , &quot; is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that are seven days , 24 hours on the day , 24 hours on the day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , in the last century , as strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problems -- climate crisis , water , water and water systems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re very much better at looking at problems in a very long time , but finally , they finally end up .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , that &apos;s the inflation of the population &apos;s population .
child mortality has to reduce a tenth .
and what comes out of this is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and cost itself , have reduced a reduces .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently living in a peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> in the last 130 years , from 25 percent of the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
we actually redefined poverty .
remember that a big proportion of americans that live below the poverty line , water , toilets , toilets , clothes , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , air air and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth would never have been able to dream like this .
the foundation for a lot of these are technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my great friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be a big leaps , which is a big leaps , and the <unk> of moore &apos;s law , and <unk> all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and is thousands of thousands of times more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is , in good like it &apos;s in bad times , war or peace , recession , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , make the faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic diet on the left hand on the left side .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
<unk> , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call sensors in autodesk , sensors and networks , robots , vaccine , vaccine , vaccination , vaccine , vaccination , vaccine , vaccination and food , digital biology , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen <unk> supercomputer watson in the risk of &quot; risk ? &quot;
so that was great .
i have <unk> the newspapers , and i was looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love these : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available to every single owner of each owner .
four years ago , four years ago , you launched a new university , which is called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies that we focus on how these are used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create products and services to create a decade , in a decade , in a decade , can affect life from billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can affect life from billions of people today .
30 years ago , there would be ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that are doing exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance of communication .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he was invited the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was got <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome of <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not coming from pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made it so cheaply so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think about <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 percent of the energy froze all over the <unk> of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar energy in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was over 50 percent last year .
last month , this was published with a study , which shows that until the end of the decade of solar , the sunny areas of the united states of solar energy , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl sagan was the <unk> of 1990 , when it was <unk> , went back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it meant ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a lifetime of life .
we live on a planet which is covered with 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saline , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to fight <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators in your mind , one of the innovators -- he gave me the permission of them -- he gave me the permission of the <unk> , and you &apos;ve heard by a lot of you . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the hospital .
it can make a thousand liters per day from clean drinking water a day -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the director of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start a big <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is a global global world in <unk> countries on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to do the 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
remember that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> when president reagan had 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for your smartphone on your smartphone , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world that information and communication in abundance , and communication , no one could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and a photograph , libraries and a photograph , libraries and the music to medical diagnostics -- now are literally <unk> and cheaper in their phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expect .
the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> called the <unk> <unk> <unk> x prize .
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a mobile phone so to connect with the device , that you can talk to the device , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of doctors .
imagine this device , in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the lung health .
if this device has a <unk> or a <unk> that &apos;s not known , it calls the institutes of disease and prevents a pandemic in it .
but now , to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and the way , by the way , the largest agriculture explosion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had all connected among two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to grow down from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads that we never heard before , will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of the economic history , i see one of the largest economic history of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier healthier , and they &apos;re trained to get better through the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be trained with the <unk> , and so they have the opportunity to use 3d computing and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the world &apos;s <unk> ?
how about a set of new , never before .
how about the oppressed , the oppressed , where they are to make a voice to make a voice and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus with extraordinary things can create extraordinary things , things that are big companies and governments only could do in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called the foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game that can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein is going to develop .
as well , as they can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days , the human recognition is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came up and looked at who the best <unk> in the world is not a <unk> , it was not a <unk> , a woman , a woman , a woman who worked in the day as a assistant of <unk> in the day , and at night the best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to provide the major challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online with the new challenges , and to do that what needed to do .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to be a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in the business that i can allow me to give up a piece of my <unk> <unk> to give it a piece of my <unk> .
but before i &apos;m going to talk to the real issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re going to be close and move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of baseball with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to appear and turn statistics and to make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get a statistic from a statistic that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat &apos;s beating .
that means that the players beat you three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball inside the <unk> , he &apos;s going to come up , and he doesn &apos;t get caught , and who tries to throw on to the first base , it &apos;s not done in the first base , and the runner was in safety .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> <unk> of baseball player who met over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine that i &apos;m going to feel more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get into a <unk> , which is a <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a remote area , and they have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> that <unk> at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on a <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s beating .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that none of the medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be or a doctor .
but what we &apos;re doing is that we included each of them , including me , to the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one makes it on the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was <unk> <unk> student .
in high school in high school , the brian <unk> would learn that brian <unk> for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters of the swedish hospital , the <unk> hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins and , i learned the origins and , every branch , every branch of a every branch , which is <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i had even known the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i moved with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the school with the impression that i knew , if i knew anything , or it knew anything like possible , or as much as possible , as far as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a printer .
i &apos;m talking to a <unk> here in toronto , in toronto , as a woman was brought a printer into the hospital school .
at that point , i shop at that point , i attended the <unk> service .
and it was my mission , when the <unk> council was looking for studying the <unk> .
and to give my <unk> feedback .
i studied a printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i tune to them , they made sound sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under paralyzed heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , instead of pumps all the blood flow , you see a part of the blood flow in the lung , and they put this together , so the <unk> came up .
and this was not a hard way to diagnose .
i asked them and made me the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> water pills so that it &apos;s <unk> the liquid .
and over a time of a year and a half hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home to talk to my <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t take the aside and did what i should have had to have a call to my <unk> , so he had a chance to have a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did for good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to do so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home to her home , i put a little voice in me that tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in really , i was really missing for me that i asked the nurse , which i asked the nurse , which was a little bit of a printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s fine when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go . &quot;
i remember it yesterday .
so i put the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> , and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , down the hospital , and went to a parking lot to drive with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t make .
i went back to the <unk> on my way .
and there was another nurse , and there was another nurse , not the sister that had seen a desktop printer , but another three words to me , and these three words fear most of the smartest people i know .
other doctors fear these as well , but it &apos;s particularly special because we &apos;re just seeing the patients so fleeting .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients that they &apos;d type back home ? &quot;
asked the nurse , asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she came home after she had sent her home , she broke her home , she broke them back to the <unk> , she took them back to the <unk> of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
hardly barely did , and they had blue <unk> .
it &apos;s bringing all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was shocked .
and i get through this rollercoaster , because she came after the <unk> of <unk> , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , realized that it was never even again .
they had no <unk> suffered suffered .
your family gathered together .
and over the course of eight or nine days , led to the <unk> .
the <unk> day , you <unk> -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , you don &apos;t forget the name of people who don &apos;t forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks , i gave me claims , for the first time , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know all of the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend &apos;s best friend , even though this is going to be a terrible discussion , and you get a terrible discussion when you get a terrible discussion , if you get a terrible discussion , if you get a terrible discussion that leads to that kind of mistake .
if you do <unk> , and never do the mistake .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about , is the ones who do it in the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that says that that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve made bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason for my <unk> , he was very upset .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he made <unk> <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked me these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why do i go home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a stupid moments ?
why am i done in medicine ?
but slowly , it made it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun collapsed , and i &apos;ll say , maybe i can feel better .
and i was something that was that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection , and never even <unk> a mistake that could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot on and i have a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink <unk> .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and once he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came up to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember to remember the patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
and it turns out it turns out .
he had an potentially devastating illness called <unk> .
so you &apos;re google , but it &apos;s not an infection , but it &apos;s the upper <unk> , and it &apos;s the top <unk> and causes the tar sands .
and fortunately , he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of shame and self-doubt , felt out and made me liberated and went back to work and again and again , and again , happened .
i &apos;ve been able to miss two times a solar panel .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only got 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no imperfections in their treatment .
and one thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of an x-ray of the kidneys . when he was without <unk> , my colleague , my colleague , at the bottom of the patient &apos;s patients at the lower right and called the <unk> .
the other thing was strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and i asked my colleagues too .
and he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right in the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was fine .
both of the people <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , what happened in the first five years , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened over the last five years .
alone , ashamed , without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes , and if i can talk about my mistakes , if i &apos;m going to tell me what really happened , how can i find it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room -- as well , i have no idea what you think about me about me .
when did you have heard the last time about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , she goes to a cocktail party , and there you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about the own mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues in a room , and to tell you the <unk> , i would not get to tell you the end of the second story before it would be really uncomfortable to you , anybody would get a joke , anybody would move the topic , you would switch the subject and forget the rest .
and actually , in fact , if i knew or my colleagues know that a <unk> would have lost the wrong leg , you believe me , i would have to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who are not making mistakes and those who are not doing the <unk> , and the no limitation that <unk> with bad results and those things .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like an antibody that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we do the people who make mistakes from medicine , that a safe system remains .
but there are two problems .
in my sort of 20 years of medical <unk> and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and false treatments to me so much of my first article that i have for the &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; black ways , &quot; writing .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system every day , in which one of 10 <unk> either is one of 10 <unk> or wrong , which is always an wrong or <unk> and more more populous , and more more different or more populous .
in this state , around 24,000 canadians , around 24,000 canadians .
in the united states , we &apos;ve got the institute in 100,000 medicine .
they &apos;re both powerful <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> center in which medical knowledge is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive error , so we can take a perfect <unk> for an patients with pain .
and then i take the same patients with <unk> , make it <unk> and give it a slightly <unk> breath , and suddenly the story was <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all that are errors are inevitable .
so if you take the system like that , as i &apos;ve been taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , in my show , black art , &quot; i have a habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the microphone .
and then your pupils dilate , they &apos;ve come out in front of the head , then look down , and then look down , and start to tell your stories .
you want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to say to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i do . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you put in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the new defined doctor is a man , white to his humanity , accepted it , is not proud of making mistakes , but putting everything from them , so it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they &apos;re telling you other mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> supportive way that all of them are .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system in life , and then people make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is that the system is going to be able to figure out which we make mistakes that people make mistakes that anyone who can be able to make care of the potential error , in fact , in fact , to make things , which is the potential <unk> , and it &apos;s also rewarded for people like me who are making mistakes and to be able to be able to be able to make the mistakes for that rewards .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
i am a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to be able to learn to pass there .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words , i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was there .
you might think he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one as a very much &quot; common . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s , he was fish in a great style .
now it &apos;s in the red list today .
this story we heard many times about the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> will describe them as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is a different concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i studied it when i studied a lagoon in 1971 a lagoon .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate me .
and i got a awful lot of mine , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really do it from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was <unk> by a few mangroves .
there was <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well in ghana and creating average average .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was shrunk for half its greatness .
grown , five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third story tells me about my favorite <unk> in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , in the &apos; 70s -- in the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant in countries that were already 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing ship called the <unk> <unk> .
and i was driving on the southern sea , and we did all the southern ocean in the entire southern sea .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came on , and then it became <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within one year , you lead an elevation through and then start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or white coral , gets crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , you threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a life alive .
she was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is built up all of fishers , if you drive into areas , in which they had never found .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt to the <unk> of the new level , and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you zoom in , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> .
it changes the time . it changes , because for people , they are all the act of all .
every generation looks at the images that they &apos;re looking at the beginning of their conscious lives as the standard and will come to everything .
so the difference is perceived as a loss .
but you &apos;re not going to take the previous losses .
it can be a order of change .
and at the end , they &apos;re only going to get the rain lanes .
and that is , largely our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
now , you could think that the problem in the problem is that when they lived in <unk> societies , killing animals , they were killing , and they were aware of what they did .
because obviously an animal is going to be a lot of times , just once , before it &apos;s <unk> .
so you don &apos;t even lose animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
the time we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the ocean are the big fish .
they &apos;re fewer rare , because we catch them .
at the time , little fish are left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
now , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm , scientists , that it was really different .
you &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a earlier form of view , aren &apos;t the way you want to make the evidence .
so , for example , the anecdote is that the report of a <unk> report , who observed in this area , in this area that can &apos;t be used in this area , or not normally by <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is a tremendous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine reserves , we &apos;re basically doing the past .
we &apos;re looking at the past that people can &apos;t understand because they have changed and very low .
so the people who can see a marine reserve and that benefit from the insight , which is allowing it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about people who are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
now , i think the art and the film might fill the gap and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there was a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> will remind you to &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been able to feel so touched -- apart from the <unk> , why were it so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one that i &apos;m going to give , focus on cameron , with &quot; avatar <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , <unk> , you had to put if you had a typewriter to register those in the government .
they had to register a leaf out of this typewriter .
the reason for it : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could find the creator of this thought .
and we can &apos;t understand in the west , what anybody could do , and how i could be able to cut the speech of speech .
in our own countries we would never do that .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> from 2011 now and print one side , then this page is bright yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern where the page is clear to them and <unk> their printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments , the way our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three ways of the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that their money made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth online , but they &apos;ve been using it illegal by putting money from our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected the keyboard , as we &apos;ve collected over the keyboard as we &apos;re shopping for an infected computer .
america intelligence ago , two months ago , the swiss account by mr. sam jain here , and on this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free feet , which is unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely that we become victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
in the future , most of the crime are going to play online .
the second second system we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about one , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and have become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it in the money , <unk> as anonymous , and the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
we &apos;re going to be in the case of <unk> .
it shows a great definition of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to register , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody was hacked and hacked a lot .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of this group , whether he could be able to do it for possible that the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a little bit of a living ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate you takes when you have a website with <unk> service , for example , gmail .
now we &apos;re all using all of us , or many of us , gmail , or one of their competitors . but those services are especially common in <unk> states like gmail , because they know that they can be encrypted in the <unk> and that they are encrypted for the local <unk> , so that the local government cannot be <unk> in their conversation .
but if you look into a foreign expert .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the insurgents in april of the egyptian <unk> <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in these records was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes in germany , who had sold a couple of programs that they sold some programs that they could absorb -- in very large frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is exactly here .
so western governments provide governments with <unk> , so they can use their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago in a few weeks ago , and this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> to collect their <unk> .
so if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer would be saying , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we are today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , but every right , we &apos;re right that we &apos;re going to be , forever .
and do we trust that we trust one of every future government , a government that we might have to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it seems strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
and the first hadron collider were <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of a simple idea : modules , made out of cement in cement , which can fit .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the ability to build things larger than we , building buildings , a rock after the other .
essentially , the <unk> had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with it .
it was automatically called <unk> stone .
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego did it for all possible .
lego has essentially taken the <unk> , the <unk> building in the world , and then made a building block for our imagination .
in the same time , bell labs , he announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that he <unk> us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks in a world that would be interactive .
as the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build a lot larger , more complex cycles , a stone after the other .
but there is a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time was reserved for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets together .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is <unk> and orange .
so everything you need to do is one blue and put them together , and they can connect them very quickly and build very quickly .
you add a blue in a green , and you can make light .
you can insert a switch in and so they built a little <unk> .
take the switch out to the switch , which is here , and this is here , and they &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the simple play , it &apos;s actually pretty powerful .
instead , you have to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to use them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so in order to slow this speed or slow it down , they just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slow down .
and the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> kids around children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how they start to understand the electronics that surrounds them , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
as an example , as an example works , or why the doors of <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought them to <unk> .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience with no experience that started playing with <unk> as material material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we made risd , and put them out of some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a lobster from squishy , which is fear of darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> , another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material to all available .
so sensory source is open source .
you can go to the website , you can all download all the <unk> and they make yourself .
we want to do the world of the creators , the inventor that encourage <unk> , because this world we live in , that we live in , this interactive world , us .
so , go ahead and start to invent it .
thank you .
