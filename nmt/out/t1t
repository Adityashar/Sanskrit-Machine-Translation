you know , one of the great <unk> in the journeys and one of the joys of the research , in common with people who can remember the old days , they &apos;re still touching them on the rain , they touch them in the bitter petals of plants .
just knowing that <unk> is still beyond the milky way or the meaning of the elders of the inuit , which is the idea that the world is in which the world , in which we &apos;re doing in the most absolute sense , which is the idea that the world is where the world &apos;s <unk> , even as a consequence of a group of certain possibilities , even successful , many generations ago .
and of course we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to have a <unk> separation by the death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter that it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , and this is an <unk> in the southern desert , or even a <unk> in the desert , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there &apos;s another <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of changing on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only meet with hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that can be as important and for the reason that the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> can be able to think of as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths and intuitions that are being defined by the early minds of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re able to do as amazing species .
and as the same as the biosphere was heavily eroding , this was starting with the <unk> -- only with even greater speed .
not a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all kinds of times are not true , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- corresponds to what we &apos;re known as <unk> in the area of cultural diversity .
and the crucial indicator of this is extinction .
when every one of them was born in this room , were talking about 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the totality of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means of the soul with a certain culture of a certain culture of the material world .
any language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , a idea , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages , today , today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half in monterey .
they didn &apos;t teach infants anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be lonely to be more than the silence to be <unk> , one of the last of your people who speak your language , not a possibility of the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors ?
and yet , this horrible story actually is actually somewhere on the earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , dies an elderly , and takes the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of them say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be a better place when we all talk about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let them be <unk> . &quot;
and then they would suddenly recognize how it would be if they could not speak their own language .
so i want to take you in a sort of trip through a journey through the <unk> , a quick journey through the <unk> , to try to make them understand what was actually lost .
now there &apos;s some of us out of us that i say , when i say &quot; different ways of his life , &quot; really different ways of his own .
take the example of this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east of sacred snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t do cognitively between the colors between the colors and green , because the <unk> of the forest , which people depend upon .
they have a strange language and a <unk> that will be called linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this roots in the <unk> past . the strange of these big houses , where the <unk> were talking about six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just hear up and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating strains that i &apos;ve ever lived in , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was contacted peaceful .
in 1957 , five <unk> contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they took shiny photographs of himself from the air , which we were forgetting as a friendly gesture . and they forgot that these people from the rainforest never seen something of their life in their life .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find nothing and <unk> the business business of cancer are killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t have killing the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we had the people that he had become so old , he gave him that one of the people died , and we killed him .
but at the same time , she had a clarity of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine from 40 steps , and determine what animal species that owned .
in the early age of years , i got a really amazing job when i was interested in to go to haiti and the secret societies , which was the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> and the poison that was used for this to make <unk> .
to give a sense of one sense , i had to give you something about this remarkable faith and <unk> is no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s about a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them , the great world leaders , what would you say ?
christianity , buddhism , buddhism or whatever .
a continent continues to leave out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith . of course there was a religious belief , of course , the remains of these very profound religious thoughts that was during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what <unk> is so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living lead to the spirits .
the ghosts can be <unk> from below the big water , answers to the rhythm of the living , to <unk> the soul of the living , so that the <unk> for a brief <unk> moment to god .
<unk> say , &quot; your white goes in the church and say about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind . how can you win damage to you ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> of the brain without burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the spirit of the mind the body is so to affect the body , if it &apos;s <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all people who i met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada <unk> de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization that the caribbean <unk> in colombia , and in a result of the conquest of the conquest of the conquest , moved to this people in a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s rising over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were never conquered by the <unk> .
until the day today , they become by a ritual priesthood . the education of education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world in the base of the glacier for 18 years . two periods about nine years of pregnancy , they spend now <unk> <unk> in the lap of the great mother &apos;s lap .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re introduced culturally into the values of their society , values that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic response -- or we could say the ecological -- or we could say the environmental -- equilibrium .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , they will suddenly take out one day , and for the first time in their life , when the sun begins to see , all of a sudden , when the sun begins to see , and the priest of the first light , when the sun begins , and says , &quot; do you see ? it &apos;s really what i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about war and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> , and the old gossip of the fancy wild , which is a <unk> thought , or say , these people are more associated with nature than we do .
so , aboriginal are neither <unk> , and they &apos;ll be from the <unk> weakened .
it stays not much place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , which is shaped by the idea of being able to be aware of the idea , but on a very close intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because they &apos;re <unk> into the human consciousness .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes that will be in the andes , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and a different relationship in montana , and a different relationship from montana , which is a pile of stones , which is a pile of stones , which is a pile of stones that can be eroding .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
this made me to another person as my friends among the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits , who are in the <unk> of the world , spirit that they would be involved in their <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from the many of you , the most powerful preparation of the <unk> .
what <unk> is so fascinating is not just the most fascinating thing , is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but on the way , there &apos;s been this wooden <unk> in your mind , but on the one side , there &apos;s something like a series of <unk> , but on the petals of a <unk> of the family with the name of the <unk> with the name of the <unk> with the name of the <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that serotonin and <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve got this stuff <unk> , this substance that they &apos;re producing from different species also contains <unk> .
this powder is to <unk> something like a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it gets no distortion of reality , but resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who &apos;s been able to put this <unk> as a <unk> mushrooms , and i argued that in the moment you know , in the moment you know , in the moment you feel the impact , you know , you know , to experience a <unk> .
but the thing with <unk> is that they can &apos;t take <unk> , because they can <unk> by one in the human gut with names , with names , <unk> .
they can only be taken into connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> from exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of reducing these two <unk> plants , which , if in this way , in this way , they create a kind of <unk> version , so that all bigger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistakes , which turns out as meaningless .
but you wonder the indians say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does this mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 variants that they all recognize in the forest that can see for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they found their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take any of the 17 varieties of wood and they sing to one in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than <unk> .
now , the <unk> problem is that even those among us , the sympathy of us have been able to have the difficult situation to be able to be able to take in the difficult situation as the real world , as the real world , that means our world , progresses .
so , in fact , in fact , you &apos;re in the 20th century , in 300 years , in 300 years , but rather than an era of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active and passive diversity on earth either active and passive diversity . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have always involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> listened to sioux , when she stopped bow and arrow , as the americans stopped americans , when they stopped americans and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you go in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are going to be covered by raw forces , whether they &apos;re going to see the <unk> of <unk> in the forest , whether it &apos;s been charged with raw <unk> in the forest , whether it &apos;s <unk> in the forest , which has been ready to see the forest of customization , who are willing to see their <unk> with raw <unk> in the forest , or as in the case of the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , which were <unk> during the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i work a lot , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people is convicted in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , not just not just sentenced , but <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if they don &apos;t have experienced it at <unk> level .
i was once with a young colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw the face of the statistics that you &apos;ve heard over the statistics and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this boy was identified as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug bug in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for the crime .
he was placed in the age of two years into prison to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that this brave did <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day , they came out of an tags on an <unk> and for these <unk> , she had to work in a heavy labor camp .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really have a choice before . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist saying , before she died , that as we would see all the whole range of human imagination , we wouldn &apos;t only see the entire range of human imagination , but that we would see the entire range of human imagination , but we have forgotten that there was ever different options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us the agriculture , and we put us in this moment of cult <unk> , the poetry of <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood &apos;s <unk> and hierarchy , specialization , had created specialization .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all respond to the challenges we &apos;re in the ensuing millennia .
when we ask these myriad <unk> to the human importance , answers , with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to <unk> the possibility of what we are : people with all people are aware that all people are aware that all people have to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the northern end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit and during the <unk> years of <unk> our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather man refused .
the family , the fear of his life took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit were not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of her sled were originally made from fish who was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid before the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out out , he took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces began to market , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the <unk> and as it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and playing a <unk> , took the skeleton of the dog and hacking a sled , <unk> another dog and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
so you can do anything like anything .
and this is in many many ways a symbol of the inuit and all the native parts in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit , in april 1999 , the complete control of an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that <unk> <unk> with their people and reaching .
and finally , i believe , it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who are to the distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in the past , and for all of us , are going to become the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children part of the geography of the hope .
what we ended up at national geographic is trying to believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling . our website receives 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we corporation a series of journeys in the <unk> where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonders , that this world has made it in a truly multicultural world , that this world has made it in a truly multicultural world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do you first , as fast as possible , is the fundamental piece of work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year , and it &apos;s an environment where they &apos;re either local or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can seamlessly and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of <unk> and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the performance of a system can be like that , is the number of digital pixels in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can really show something like this , to show that this is a real representation of <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a magazine or a newspaper to read about a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also made something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really rampant this ideas to stop this limits for the screen on the screen .
we hope that this is no <unk> and others anymore -- that should not need to be necessary .
of course , the mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this domain .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take something else out .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project with the name that really connects two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> that from noah <unk> , a <unk> at the university of washington , under the counseling of steve <unk> at the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see this , if we create this kind of views where we can penetrate through images and have this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation , the images is here in fact .
the <unk> have held these images together with the real space , in which these recordings that were made out near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , correspond to the elements of <unk> , or <unk> , and these things became <unk> in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got some time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s what &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
i &apos;d like to go straight straight to the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is not necessarily the punchline behind this technology , and this is not necessarily the punchline behind this technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame , which was just held solely in the computer with images . give pictures of men on flickr , and they get pictures of men on flickr , and on the <unk> and forth . each of these orange represents a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in relation to this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
now , you know , i never believed that i will actually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception desk .
i suspect you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : all of the things of the <unk> : everything from the <unk> , a fairly large number of them that are all <unk> in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange strange .
many of them are from their faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame that was right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s going to be data from all -- from the entire collective memory of it , how to look like the visual -- and everything is going to be connected .
all these photographs will be connected and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
consider this as the sequel of the labor of the labor of stephen <unk> at virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , grows and its use for the user with the application .
their own photographs are going to go with metadata <unk> , which has a different person took .
if someone had the effort , and all of these saints labeled , and tells you who they are all of the data , and i can use them as a start to go into this space , and i can use them as a point of <unk> <unk> , and so a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> of social experience .
and of course , <unk> all of them are the extremely rich virtual models of the earth that doesn &apos;t only get through <unk> or satellite imagery and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software is that at a certain point , in the next time , all the images that are used by someone in the world are common to each other ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want them to create <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting if you think about the amount of <unk> information that are many of these pictures .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures where they put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information , which is the picture that is .
but how would it be when the picture you connected with all their pictures ?
then the scope of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that comes out of this , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope in unison with other things you &apos;ve already heard . and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
so official <unk> works so : if our goal is maximizing the common good our citizens , this is largely about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , a <unk> assumption for human .
if people have freedom , each of us , each of us is to do the things that make our good and nobody has to decide for us .
the way of freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have . and the more freedom you have , the more good you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply , that it would not come to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what to modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to just say about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if they &apos;re not <unk> the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> who could buy a large number of own lettuce , in the unlikely case , that none of the store for you right .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one of the electronics .
we can put together <unk> million different assets from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was been able to have every phone members , you wanted to get every phone by ma bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of this was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and you should not have that until now in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more likely to buy objects , meets the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer in the united states that they go to the ph.d. and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to a ph.d. and the doctor says , we could do b or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not she . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , that &apos;s a shift of burden for someone who knows something of someone who knows , and therefore , not in the best condition , and therefore in the best condition is a decision to make a decision .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like them and me , that , if you think about it , at all , if you don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect us to call the doctor at the next morning and to ask a change of the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice to show how this slide is supposed to show .
we <unk> no identity , we invent them .
and we are <unk> ourselves so often as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up at the morning , they need to decide what to be you to do .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which <unk> was that almost everybody had one had one , and they were able to get as fast as they could , and then kids were able to get them .
the only choice was &quot; who &quot; don &apos;t , and not what they did afterwards .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less than i used to do earlier .
and that not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or just a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get to you and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to be blessed with the technology that enables us to work every minute from every single place on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way i &apos;m not going to tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions again , again and again , if we should work or not work .
we can see our kids in playing football play , and we have our mobile phone on the rest of the hip and our blackberry in our waist , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re off all the one , every minute we <unk> our child <unk> , we also ask us , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also when the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we now look like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , <unk> ways is that it &apos;s <unk> .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about one million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> who took the employers who took for 2 percent .
you offer 50 <unk> to -- 10 percent less employees , as if you only offer five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are so hard to decide what you want to pick it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow is never coming .
you know , this is not just meant that people need to eat food if they &apos;re not enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money to drive , it means that they miss great <unk> their employers .
by which not participating in them to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think that the world looks like this .
you want to make the decision really really properly , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the false investment fund , or even the wrong <unk> .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and make a decision , we end less content with the outcome of choice as if we had the opportunity to choose between less ways .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is one of them , involve the big choice of different <unk> , if you buy one , and what happens is that they have a better decision , and what happens is that they have a better decision , and what happens is that you have to make the decision , and what happens is that you have been made of the decision , and this regret works on their happiness , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is , the easier , it &apos;s nothing to regret that is <unk> for the choice .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by making the way he told the way we think about what we think about .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive qualities of thinking about alternatives that makes you less content with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they would have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for itself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot about day .
<unk> increases the happiness that we get through our choices , even if that &apos;s what we &apos;ve selected is fantastic .
and the more ways there are more options , the more attractive qualities of these choices are going to account into account into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about this in now and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he does is : always who they decide for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this was struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans in the way , and they have bought them , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they have been incredibly <unk> , and if she carried them long enough , they &apos;ve started , &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sellers said , &quot; do you want <unk> , lightly <unk> or a long ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw down , and after i recovered , &quot; i &apos;d like to be the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was , so i spent all this damn jeans , and i &apos;ll say the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all this selection allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason for the reason that i was worse , with all this available possibilities , my expectations for doing what a good few jeans is up .
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations when it was just in a way .
when they came in 100 species , damn one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected .
so the add of opportunities in the lives of people &apos;s lives will inevitably have the expectations of people as good as good as well .
and this leads to the results of the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this . because if you would , they don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people who were a comfortable surprise .
now , in the world , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection , with perfection as expectation -- the best thing you can hope is as good as you expect it .
they will never be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;re all coming -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short designer moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i could not make it better . i don &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad jeans if it &apos;s just a way to buy , and you ask why if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask why who &apos;s in the answer . the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : they .
they would have better do better .
with 100 different types of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , feel frustrated about it , they blame themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only thing , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also , if you have a <unk> of the depression , and then , if you have to explain these experiences , think of it , think it would be your fault .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s generally better to be objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is something more more than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that that more choice is better than a little selection .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve lost this point for a long time that we &apos;ve improved a lot of energy .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule question , the thing about thinking about this , which is what all of these selection enables in the industrialized societies , is the material of wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of you whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve <unk> has told you yesterday about how this more expensive and hard to <unk> the car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry about that .
if something about what the people of our society enables us to make decisions in the societies in which people would have changed , not only the life of humans , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great selection selection .
finally , reading this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
they don &apos;t know it possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they have no freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , lower happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to narrow with perfect security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> being <unk> is a recipe for misery and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects already before the human genome and what could mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized the biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new life and build new lives .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists are trying to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we try to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which has the smallest genome of a species in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to achieve that with a smaller genome .
we managed to prevent it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic card , which is very simple , in comparison to us . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we can eliminate all these genes that we can eliminate one according to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to make this chromosome to what allows us to vary the individual components and so some of those fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecules ever before ?
and if we can do this , we can launch the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has increased very slowly , and so our last point would put up in a exponential curve .
we started about 15 years ago .
it took actually some years starting with a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , so it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you do a piece of power , the more errors happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces and <unk> the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria kills .
we built little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and made into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles are then made by the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
recently i talked about the oil industry , and they said they could actually understand this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in software in software in the software in a biological system .
but we wanted to go further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters in the size of the virus , so we thought we could vary it in tapes .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in computer , these digital information must really be <unk> .
when we first sequenced the genome first 1995 was the <unk> in a mistake .
we found the <unk> 30 errors . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been <unk> .
a part of the design is to create pieces of 50 letters long and that have to overlap with others , to build smaller <unk> .
we have built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in <unk> .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- this letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially we &apos;ve only signed .
some people were told that it was no poetry .
we have so constructed the pieces so that we could just split them with enzymes with enzymes . there are enzymes those repair and forth .
and we started making pieces , starting with the pieces of five to <unk> letters in these days , added these together in order to put these back up to self-assemble .
in each step , we have these pieces in surplus as we could sequence them because we tried a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right work -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then these are not just growing in e. coli . and so beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we applied ourselves other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to fixing dna that can join these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of radiation .
you see in the upper field , that chromosome drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all over once it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space exist and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve only used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we put them off .
this is not <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we actually can see it with the <unk> .
this is images over a long amount of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve only done recently .
these are over <unk> letters in <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would contain <unk> pages , just around this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simple if you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this cloning .
at <unk> is the chromosome into the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown a whole chromosome of a chromosome from a cell and going on this .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly said , they could pick up this chromosome . and it was very amazing as we could pick it into a cell , and it was very amazing than we gave it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very <unk> .
the new chromosome was in the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to take the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all kinds of species here , or a third of <unk> , every time of thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who have changed evolution as a gene that has changed at a moment , much of biology .
there is enzymes the <unk> called the <unk> that are actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we put in .
it was <unk> in the cell and saw the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes we &apos;ve added in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and <unk> completely into a new species on the new software that we gave in the cell .
all of the proteins change the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve moved .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things change things quite dramatically .
now i argued this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution
and i have argued that we could possibly create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be made a new form of the cambrian explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re doing this six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people have existed on this planet for every year in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , medicine , fuel for eight billion people .
it becomes a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion drums of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million drums on a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material landing in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve been now talking about our discoveries of all the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of this .
we &apos;re in the first line in the limits of biological reality and that of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this fast <unk> to do this what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot of the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to create <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of active <unk> at the time we &apos;re actually sitting down to design and make new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fossil generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn , recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation that are going to be coming out of a lot of energy , like <unk> or different species of <unk> .
but as we think , the only way of biology is a huge impact on the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go .
and we think we &apos;re first going to be the first with the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , with virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane to use hydrogen as energy source .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought to <unk> , <unk> carbon dioxide , to power that process .
within a short period of time we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the whole <unk> industry . right . if you can &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? a <unk> of the energy .
but the same time we &apos;re working on to use the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we are light years away from people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i gave one introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those people who were not there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment which ever became -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a <unk> second of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just amazing ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in construction so they see the scale .
the last year last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> which the whole track around the lhc <unk> to <unk> to a part of the lhc to put an rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> , or this , when someone went to google side and the front page .
it means we reached an cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires -- this golden wires here here .
these wires lead <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
well , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no that doesn &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far down , they become called <unk> .
so at negative degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand this tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets , there was a <unk> .
by making heat heat slightly and <unk> resistance and <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is very wonderful as you imagine that the magnet weigh 20 tons and shifted about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on your way back .
at the end of march will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up and expect to collect first data in june or july let &apos;s focus our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a way , these accidents are taking the value of science and <unk> in such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it is so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our borders , forms the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to one of a english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who was what i suspect when he defended the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his training was so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , as to assume that our <unk> are <unk> in nature that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change .
however , recent is recent life in my life and my career , which has happened to me to think of my work completely .
this strange event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , love , in the world went out for some reasons in the world , and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t care , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as to the doom .
seriously -- the demise !
for example , they come up with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that they never become the success ?
do you have not afraid that they <unk> their entire life and never create a book who cares ? never ?
okay , that makes really courage .
but it would be worse if i wouldn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first told them about 20 years ago , that i wanted to be writer that was confronted with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> are not afraid to have succeeded ?
don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of an <unk> kills ?
you don &apos;t know fear that you &apos;re going to get this craft your life and never get something that you are going to die on a <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter ash of the failure ?
so about you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all this questions is : <unk> yes .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things that no one would show up .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking : why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that of someone should be expected to do the work to do the work ?
and what exactly is with the creative enterprises , that they make us insecure about the reciprocal quality -- in a way , how other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair to be fair -- the group of chemists have not receiving the reputation of <unk> people .
we were writers , but not only the writers , but not only the writers of all the <unk> , seem to be able to be new incredibly unstable .
all you need to do is to look at bitter <unk> of really great minds alone , the young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , were really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death , <unk> each of my books had killed me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even twitch when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for such a long time , and somehow , we have the notion that creativity and <unk> , of course , <unk> and that art -- always to the <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel about that ? because with only an inch , i feel like that , i feel at all .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s taken over to the next century .
i find it better when we encourage our big creative encourage to live .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start with this dark path of the conjecture , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career here .
that means -- look : i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work , which comes after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s most likely that my biggest success was behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that you can bring someone to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to me that i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological construction building .
somehow , i have to find a way to be able to make a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the response will be on the writing .
while i looked for models for models for models to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for other societies to see whether you could find other societies , and i &apos;ve been trying to see if we can help , as you can help , with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity .
this led me to old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in the old greece and rome did not believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity <unk> demons .
from socrates known that he believed he would have a <unk> that <unk> him from <unk> .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> genius <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly smart individual individual .
they believed that a genius was the kind of magical creature was being living in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist in the work of the work was kind of invisible and the result of the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work is brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not perfect , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people in the west really have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came up and all changed . we had this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual in the universe -- over all of the gods , and there &apos;s no room more for mystic creatures to take orders from divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started to believe that creativity was completely from an individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people like this or those artists call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to say , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person is to allow the pelvis and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence of all of them is a <unk> , human psychology .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the cancer and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations to success .
i think that this <unk> is our artists of the last 500 years .
and when that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t get the <unk> from 500 years from a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would register <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> that people <unk> and <unk> on their projects etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything i &apos;ve heard , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that goes -- like everyone knows it has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always sensible .
in fact , he can feel really like <unk> .
i had a little encounter as i had a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which was over the fields , but she told me that she was working on the fields . she told me that she was working on the fields . she told me that she would feel and listen like a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a <unk> train out of air .
that &apos;s about the country on them .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could do a moment of one moment . and this was -- in their words -- <unk> run like the devil <unk> .
she ran as the devil to the house while she was tracked enough to a sheet of paper and a pen had to get it quickly enough to get a piece of paper and a pen to get it through them to capture and capture on the sheet .
in others , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran it up and ran it . she didn &apos;t missed it , and she was missed it . she said it would go to land and -- as she said -- <unk> after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said there were more moments in which she was almost missed .
so she goes down to the house and looking for the paper and the poem drive through them , and she reaches a pen as it comes through and then -- she said -- was it like to grab with her other hand and get it .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem was fine and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought <unk> this is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time and sweating , and really awkward .
but even i have a <unk> , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had to work or ideas that &apos;s from a source through me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we start to lose this in relation to our minds , but we even lose ourselves in the contrary to intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musician tom <unk> . i had to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what &apos;s the most time of his life , who was trying to dominate these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him to dominate them and deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was driving on a freeway in los angeles , and there everything changed for him .
he went at high speed when he suddenly hears a small fragment of a melody , which , as it &apos;s a lot of it , and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he has no <unk> .
so he begins to get these old <unk> into him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t create it .
but instead of getting out , he just listened to .
he stopped the whole train and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , <unk> excuse me , can you not see that i go ?
<unk> , i can just see a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on to a <unk> moment when i can take care of you .
if not , <unk> is somebody else today .
go and <unk> leonard .
his whole <unk> has changed after this .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever used .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , was salvaged than he was doing nothing as trouble , where he was doing anything from the trouble , where he came from . he realized that it had no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing that was not quite a tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i was working and i &apos;ve saved me .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love . i fell in one of these regions of the <unk> that we all fall in , if we &apos;re all going to work . this is going to be a disaster . this is the worst book that ever became written .
not just bad , but worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript and talking to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i talked loudly : <unk> listen , you and i don &apos;t know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not quite my fault , right ?
because you see that i have all i have investing in , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up and your share of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to go further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to show up to the board that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows in the deserts of <unk> people with saints with holy dances and music that were funded for hours -- to dawn .
these fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , happened something special . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that they &apos;ve all seen in your life before .
it was as a time <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> . he did nothing differently than he did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything made together .
and all of all , he seemed no longer more human .
he was getting up from the inside of the inside and from below below the bottom of the <unk> fire .
as something that happened at the time , people knew what was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still have at <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer in spain has done something magical : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great than it is , a <unk> view on god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky thing follows the next morning when the dancers themselves wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 watch on a tuesday -- and he no longer was a <unk> of god in her .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never go back to that altitude .
and maybe someone will never call god name when he turns . but what &apos;s going to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a loaner -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of their life that will be passed on to somebody else when they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , that &apos;s all changes .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book that will appear soon -- as dangerous , very expected , very expected to success .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;ll be crazy about this , is no fear .
not <unk> .
make your job .
hang on for your contribution , whatever he &apos;s going to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine divine divine divine is calling you to the site , decides for a brief moment of miracle through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance still your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that , and i have the feeling , we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you to be the mere human love and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , who had shrunk for nearly three million years of the size of the lower states for 40 percent .
but this is not strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it shows the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it <unk> in the summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood that comes out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , there &apos;s the warming of the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there is large amounts of carbon dioxide , which if he <unk> <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> material in the atmosphere could double if we cross this critical point .
today , <unk> in some flat lakes in alaska in alaska .
professor <unk> , walter <unk> in alaska is to another prosthetic seas in alaska .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it <unk> us .
and a reason is , this huge heat warms up from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up by <unk> .
these rivers are taking very rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month by last month , the entire continent has now got an negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> , is particularly strong at the melting .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , see up the top new lakes that were glaciers who were frozen .
40 percent of all people on the world get half their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have expanded .
but when you <unk> , most of the water is <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra level of oil .
this affects the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all around the world have increased in a really <unk> and previously , an unprecedented extent .
so many times in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years we have 70 million tons of co2 by co2 -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific precisely from the american continent and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a dramatic decrease in the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the exact biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminate the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars in order to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
after christmas , at christmas , at home in tennessee , one billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this happened about christmas .
one of the commercials of <unk> around christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy kid .
there &apos;s it in shell and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> becomes every day clean .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear one . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they talk about .
so the alliance has called two .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it to the supreme court to spend a sizable <unk> on the way to bring the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and smells of good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let them leave that .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that these all connects to this is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to bring us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america &apos;s new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways of the fastest ways of the old , dirty fuels , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good jobs .
<unk> america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking them to ask your childhood when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach out the hands of it and <unk> , the <unk> , and moves , you actually learned to understand and changing problems through understanding and changing relationships .
the spatial space is very closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , which would be when we could use computers , which would be when we could take computers and take data , and they could take data , how we want to take it ?
this question was so emotional that we decided to study and <unk> <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with the hand , they can perceive each other , and they have a screen and you have a <unk> .
much more importantly , you &apos;re physically why you &apos;re just able to reach them through the outward and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> the manipulation of <unk> data .
and when these tools are really going to become physical and an awareness for their movements , each other can recognize each other and see the intricacies of our <unk> with you , then we can start with exploration and more entertaining <unk> .
i start with a few simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and when i put it into a direction , the video &apos;s going to play forward ; if i go into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , you make it interest .
if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , you notice that and can be nervous .
and they feel also their movements and bend .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply all the gestures on data , as you could apply this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they get together .
if we overdo it , we can slightly <unk> .
there &apos;s also some nice ways in education like languages , math or <unk> where we give people the possibility of fast trial and we want to see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m doing with a simple <unk> model .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of round of <unk> , and as you try to form words , are tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , and you have a new <unk> and a try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a media lab . i could move them to try it to try it and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> at the bottom right .
it turns out that he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by making the <unk> from the table , which shows this character .
here it makes the sun rise .
the sun goes on .
now he picks a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by making the <unk> <unk> , he can interact the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story open and he can decide how they developed .
flying cat .
the last example , for that i have time to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , <unk> and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes in the sequence that you can organize in any patterns .
and you <unk> them by just to hold a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect him with a certain clay and tends to be hiring .
and then then even simpler effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start , in which we <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and put these up in a series , they extend a little more the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something on this .
and now i put the filters with the drums so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by getting the pace in one or other direction .
and now i hook the filters with the bass . for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as she &apos;s going on .
so , i don &apos;t have to make them in the face , but i can improvise ; they &apos;re reducing by reducing them .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by looking out to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> , the better way to fit our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the verge of <unk> to the interaction with digital media , the information in our world to bring information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to everybody .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yes , so , what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back to a little bit , and it &apos;s <unk> at the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and research now for a few years , and that &apos;s what i started to know because i just wanted to know , and it wanted to make everything i &apos;ve learned in college studying .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think the biology of biology now , so quite generally talking biotechnology , which you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important , and yet , much more important will be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like these whole engineered plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that tries to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
now , under then there &apos;s things that are going to come completely in everyday , what most people are not aware of , for example , the most people who allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue back endlessly .
so from the interest in this technology , in this technology , i &apos;m just on <unk> .
so what &apos;s hacking ?
most people know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers <unk> , and then it &apos;s always like this , yes , the hacker break up somewhere and claws and so on .
this is kind of really sad for the <unk> , because that &apos;s not true what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually started and what &apos;s actually about it .
and they have the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about that with a playful , creative , original original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , so it can also be a <unk> thing , which is a question of something like things like things , and how can you make it better .
and it was just about software with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that makes all kinds of <unk> things .
and now still wait in biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , because , the <unk> code is an abstract code , because it &apos;s big , because it &apos;s matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and look at it , and so i find it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to find a lot deeper with this .
this was actually just <unk> eight , these these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , which is now members or active people everywhere in the world .
that &apos;s this has a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and companies and in collaboration with scientists and asking questions and ask questions and ask questions and ask questions , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about how to find a <unk> access to make a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> a network , which is actually more like a forum where you look true and talk online .
they &apos;re a little technical sequence and also a little bit of <unk> on the way , then also , they &apos;re asking questions .
and based on these networks that did the whole popular thing , has been developed as a scene that i &apos;d like to give a moment .
here in the image on the left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so in principle , a private school , charitable club , where everybody can be to be .
kids , old , all kinds of people go through it , and they &apos;ve made a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> .
here &apos;s a group at the bottom there is a group in indonesia called <unk> means that there &apos;s been pretty long .
more than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also living in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and combine this in quite a kind of <unk> way .
a group from ankara , which i met a while ago , which is a <unk> , which is what they &apos;d like to teach the public , which is what they learn in university , and they were trying to explain to people who &apos;s <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got up in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of a exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing what what &apos;s actually united of the , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with this , and also , in particular , in the society , so , okay , so , okay , what do you want to join , do your interest in that , do your interest in that ?
so , <unk> , to hacking biology , you need somehow material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you need also tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are so much <unk> machines , extremely expensive , just for <unk> , trained , <unk> , and so on .
and our approach was just saying , <unk> , that actually doesn &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every single <unk> has actually developed higher technology than most <unk> , that &apos;s really like this .
and all of these premise with that premise then , for example brian <unk> in england , and then a <unk> <unk> , has been able to take a <unk> and , yes , so <unk> , and then has been bred bacteria .
so everyone who has a soup , which he has left too long , also done .
i &apos;m trying to try this in my lab home , trying to take a little bit on ebay and then made a little <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so as well as so / <unk> .
that should actually be a joke at all , but .
here in the picture you see in the picture you see , in <unk> , so , in <unk> , a group in paris , which has been in college , a group in paris , which has been in the university of this , which has been doing pretty well , and also really interesting things , i want to do a project for a moment .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you can see it &apos;s relatively complicated , so that &apos;s there , there &apos;s a lot of people who do that home alone , to a lot of organizations , which is actually more <unk> in <unk> form .
but always always the approach that it should just be easy and to be available .
the first project that we &apos;ve made as international group , when we &apos;re basically aware of our selves , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all familiar with the people who always chat there and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website the founder of the founders , and he said , even real meeting , and then has been organized two events , one in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly on it in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , there &apos;s also what it was also about , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve got such a <unk> procedure .
this was pretty intuitive , so everyone &apos;s just got such as his wishes , his and what it does .
there came to my opinion , a very good code done .
and then we have that one of that is not compulsory , but that &apos;s actually , i think , has pretty well taken quite well , people are quite convinced from this .
and we actually tried to do that into the academic world , but there &apos;s not something like this .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in the regard , even one step further than the academic world .
yes , what about projects we actually do this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we wanted to make an optical engineer or optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , in a room , then you can capture little particles in the air or then in the ground , and then moving into this focus , so , then , that &apos;s a bit like such as a <unk> in principle .
this really works , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic <unk> , and we then thought , we took a webcam to the lens , the lens <unk> , the lens <unk> , then you have a microscope , that expands .
you see this down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> the laser <unk> and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot of this .
so another project that was from from the french group there &apos;s written from paris , which is pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he has so much like a <unk> , so <unk> or something like this , so he has been engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this shot of this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
then the visitors in the room could go in the room , sit on this chair at this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or as you thought , is then different lights in the room .
was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is that the <unk> , this is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to replicate , <unk> , fragments , to recover them visible .
so , when i do that the <unk> at the crime scene , then they go , collect any <unk> , and then you can say , <unk> , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair is about this man , like this .
and the machines that make something like this , which are pretty expensive as you buy commercially , the cheapest will go at <unk> euros .
and this is not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
and they have been there so two of these two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s going to be easier and cheaper hardware , and then we &apos;ve got this out of open source , so we &apos;ve actually brought this to recover and have the cheapest vendor of these devices worldwide .
i think , somehow six dollars or something .
but in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a frame where it &apos;s clear .
so it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i had started to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two centimeters or something like this .
you invites <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> then in these <unk> , and then i &apos;ve taken them on <unk> and then put it up .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but this is so my prototype , which didn &apos;t have looked at electronics and pressure , and that was put on , and that was the pressure was too high , the thing was too high .
and then i took a <unk> and it connected to it .
a <unk> , if you &apos;re full of power with water , that &apos;s enough pressure , so i think so 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and then you can get the particles strong enough and then go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros up , or something like this to be the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and this is also as well as this is the <unk> of the scene of the scene , and also the availability of technology and the <unk> that more people can get together there .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also no chance to make it really well .
because if you just read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it ourselves .
and i think technology will be more important in our modern societies .
and if you also have a <unk> citizens to make meaningful decisions in society , and join , then you need access to knowledge and the technology .
and you have to do it also and understand it to make it and understand it .
and the <unk> then under the <unk> <unk> and citizen science .
so that just as citizens will be able to be able to get through these scientific technologies .
and this is this <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is that they are also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that &apos;s there , there are less people registered as in fact .
so i know about some who haven &apos;t put out .
and that &apos;s now just the <unk> , individual people .
partly with these <unk> , and put these places together .
and that &apos;s all in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> it started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , there was the first one , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> all over the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to move into the same way , and then they &apos;re also very easily connected , so that wait more about it .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even again .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
thank you for listening .
that was it .
yes , hello .
how do we work people ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but also in the realm of <unk> , and in front of all things in the realm of the world .
there &apos;s about how to look at people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media and so they create a more <unk> experience .
in fact , i think the interactive media in us , cognitive models in us , so paradigm that has been programmed in our biological memory , so that we &apos;ve been programmed in our biological memory , very long , and that we can produce them just through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this <unk> that you &apos;ve seen in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is exactly at us , in our <unk> roots .
so now , what are <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve written four <unk> and i &apos;d like to explain to a moment .
to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
to these <unk> models , that we have a genetically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go to the same time , and i &apos;m going to show you by trial that they also have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve also been able to talk to these <unk> models , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition , which involves the denial of the linearity , and what of course tells us that we feel the linearity today .
the fourth point is that history is a place for us .
now , as this is with the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that .
how many doors has the house where you live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> the reality and it &apos;s no computer .
fantastic , right ?
and since we &apos;re trouble giving us to <unk> the virtual reality in our <unk> , we actually can actually do it all the time .
and this wealth of this wealth of the reality is to <unk> the people in the pre-industrial time , because they need nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memories played off .
in this head , knowledge <unk> and using this virtual images , the imagination , was passed on knowledge .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is when i could make a little trip .
yes , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time of human beings at the same time , and medium itself .
now , if you keep thinking a bit further .
what are the media today ?
then you notice that there was a change .
but that &apos;s what i get to talk about .
significant tool of <unk> have been seen since traditionally .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , were extra stopped to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still on very , very strong stories .
the author of the book the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , that we still have <unk> hours every year with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child which is to reach it to reach the most of his life , most of his life has spent most of the time of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on what we sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
this goes much further back to the cultures of the pre-industrial time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly amazing thing that we have based on our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe , of the <unk> tribe .
and the life lived in <unk> columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , from island from island to raise food .
and they did this with so-called <unk> .
this may be familiar with you , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they &apos;ve used the <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by songs .
where the language has been deciphered by the language of <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm have shown the geology , and that , of course , has allowed to be able to put these songs and into the left , and then , of course , to the left , to the left , and again , back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing away from top of a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
this is happening this is that <unk> age .
we &apos;ve done this before called <unk> .
this is happening is the age machine and happened is the book and happened is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve shifted the responsibility for our memories and that the own production of our individual memories have shifted external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so we &apos;ve got god to <unk> a piece far to <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> of the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , so it &apos;s so far to say that this mass media , and so on what we call mass mass media , and so on what we call mass mass mass of our memories , and our ability to <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the age age .
what has influence our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> influences the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be in the course of the centuries of the centuries and more <unk> by the influence of <unk> .
that means instead of remembering ourselves , we &apos;ve been standardized , very common , distributed patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more themselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing more in pictures of images , but we <unk> them to our language .
we &apos;ve got used to it that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still we are the <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s coming now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called <unk> .
that sounds very <unk> on and sounds very after fiction fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which will bring us those of these options back to all our capabilities again .
there &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this for a little time .
there are technical concepts like an example of reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then this is so a concept of what makes us do the virtual world with the real world , which means our <unk> to the virtual world , the virtual world will be addressed again .
another example is called the virtual reality .
so , of course , that sounds like the context of my talk , because we move us physically in not <unk> , virtual worlds , completely after the <unk> .
and other example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a man .
all that needs the ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i have in the degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are here today .
maybe you can just get up at a short time , so they can pause with the two things about the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again to this <unk> , cognitive models will occur .
this whole is a game , i have to say .
what the <unk> of course extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , then you &apos;ve probably probably probably seen any people with some <unk> or that they &apos;re playing with any <unk> in the hand .
in any case , they do this in there .
this is a game for outside .
and this is equipped to discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects to the virtual world , so the data is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to me that i need to expand so much .
you can make this much better better , there &apos;s more much more behind it .
it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get from the city a whole different sight , which is a whole different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get so on this way , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world is in our walls of our cities , is yeah .
and with a way , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , i &apos;d like to summarize this my talk , in the sense that the characteristics of the <unk> , and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> , technological , new products , actually not in the future , but actually to our roots come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be very much to you .
i just had been asked by whether this bag is a <unk> bag , and my instead of speaking .
that &apos;s not going to make it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve all the way there .
but so far i do it just just curious .
yes , kids are from nature from curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a designer from house , so i &apos;m looking at the topic of the curiosity and how the curiosity is too again , and why we might lose curiosity and we have to leave it again and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re concerned about as a creator as a creator .
if professors are curious , then they &apos;re often going to <unk> in so n <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half a year .
a <unk> of natural user interface to design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why don &apos;t start with so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interactions and so forth .
and there i just hold one of these little devices up because the things are increasingly more intuitive , and there are more natural , <unk> , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i have interface in the realm of design , so the next generation of the human computer in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship with how our tools or how the computer <unk> into the digital assistant .
so i got involved with that , when is what of course or intuitive .
maybe even a look at it again .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here shortly , we &apos;re going to move from the third in the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through the language .
this means , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve been able to communicate a common language , you could communicate in the same cave , you could be able to communicate in the same cave or in other areas and has created such as <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , a very living .
in fact , you had to learn , so no toddler can talk about nature , but we learn it <unk> and diet .
this was then overtaken by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of script , which means what <unk> and alive , which is what <unk> and alive , i &apos;m doing it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a whole different narrative when if there &apos;s a alive of life .
but <unk> then moved to this script as <unk> , received .
then the next generation , where we actually actually live primarily .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was just as a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , you know , if the people starts to read , and that is of course <unk> .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting thing , so a <unk> is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re in the moment , actually in this epic phase that we &apos;re involved in .
of course , that confused us , because we see on the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with complete transparency , what the new thinking is , what the new thinking is to think about , don &apos;t say that in the age of <unk> , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> , or no beef , i want to be <unk> and wants to <unk> it .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is when you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more at the local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global code .
not when i think of locally and the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this means from the local village , actually , is actually a global village , so , of course , as intuitive , as well , as well , the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village at the time , who has what , and when , that &apos;s what happens to whom , today about this expansion of our selves through the mobile level .
well , that we have to know global and faster and always have done better .
so as it used to look at the early village .
in front of the background , i just looked at me just to look at what does it mean for us , which is , of course , what we might have , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s also bad for us , what makes the difference ?
because often , people are not able to make it <unk> , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not only just change it that it is different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when , of course , something is intuitive and how can i take influence , and just according to the things that they &apos;re a <unk> , so as intuitive , because then they do fun , so they &apos;re easy to use .
you then keep busy looking at the study of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s also , of course , where you start and look at this and says , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it actually look out there ?
so how do we work if we <unk> ?
and what means of course , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work .
because steve jobs have said , you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you have to really see in detail when i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which means that in the core .
and this is what you see is that you have a our seven sense of the most of us , most of all of us , there &apos;s been seven , in fact , in the near future , the next time , and as extension , again , our self .
and to look , how process we process information , how do we take information ?
say alone , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
a lot of use the word , don &apos;t know what it means to take your detail .
but i have to understand in the core to understand when information gets information to information , when going to information information and from information , knowing what i can also intuitive , or of course , could be intuitive or of course .
and of course , how makes design influence on perception .
we see this here when i made things , then i can engineer them like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make you kind of intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a vessel , but i can sort of look directly , where is salt and pepper &apos;s inside .
and when i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , he &apos;s going to start thinking about where &apos;s what &apos;s inside .
and the left simply access to access and then hopefully , i hopefully have any sugar in there that salt just is .
but also our perception of ourselves , how makes you feel .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just as much as big , and yet our perception , depending on what we &apos;re doing things .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s no longer to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle starts to connect or associate it .
and if i do stop a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t just see a unit , which is a circle , and yet we see one unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , a circle , a circle , another .
this is what you call <unk> or just <unk> , which also affects ourselves in perception .
so important for the creator for the creator , they &apos;re in the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the continuity of continuity and so on .
often at the third then again .
but this is essential to the essential component , if you want to design things very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting as that &apos;s very interesting .
it sounds very banal , is so exciting if you &apos;re closer to that .
so we have the front of the eyes and now think we &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back of the back .
because they &apos;re <unk> an assumption that you can see something you recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re just <unk> to see our eyes before we see it back back to the back of our <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got that cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s also there , that comes back back .
then it goes back to the front , because that &apos;s not the back of the front of the front , and says , well , well , you know , you can see what you see , also what you want to see .
and then it goes back back and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how certain things happening and in what to happen for <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who of you know that picture .
there is exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s what what you see .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , exactly .
if i saw this once that there is a <unk> in there , then you know that .
they &apos;ll never forget anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , now you always see him .
that means i &apos;ve actually spoiled it in fact that they don &apos;t see any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short time , and again , again , to see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is these projection of vision , <unk> .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , really exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray is not actually not , but here in this <unk> mass as well .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds until i sort of , in the present , i can also get very well <unk> , and i can get a very well <unk> that i &apos;ve always done with three seconds .
it has to process it only as the present .
then it moves into the past and so i can bridge very elegant <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a completely interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fell in love .
this means , if you know that , look at what you &apos;re looking at as long because i don &apos;t conceive of it , because i can &apos;t have <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the most of the perceptions of the perceptions that we have .
that means this first idea is going to happen in a rapid speed , how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re also to protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about this .
of course , the creator of course , not only with the theme of perceptions and neural <unk> or neural <unk> , but primarily with the theme of the <unk> .
so , like a person is looking at certain things .
there &apos;s actually the practical functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> where i know exactly where i really can reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why does someone have a little bit of <unk> , where hardly do anything like any <unk> , so much of these <unk> sums of money , even though it isn &apos;t so practical ?
there we are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , where we have , of course , as a creator .
back to my actual subject of natural users and the topic , what of course is <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> means always , how can i get to a certain goal or how to get a user in a particular environment , more effective , efficient and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s how it says the norm .
how can i make something more <unk> ?
i can use that straight or do i need the n of this , or i need the training of it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i just make this different and make beautiful , not that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we just saw , and look at it , and then you can also understand why <unk> percent of our software is very intuitive or not more intuitive , including <unk> , including it as much more intuitive than the classic software .
this is intuitive <unk> not only since apple &apos;s <unk> , <unk> primary <unk> , if i &apos;d like to harness technology devices of human beings .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re using through this new way of <unk> , so the natural user , for example five times in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new way of the natural software just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;ll probably get four hours to go home , but your employers or someone &apos;s going to take them up with the four hours .
but i want to say that it is for us to be a corresponding <unk> , of course , to produce some things .
when we go back again in the realm of software here , so the first <unk> line , which were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing came up now with a <unk> neural model or mental model as the software is saying , because you have a idea of something , the metaphor of a desktop , to harness the computer .
so not more zeros and ones or ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
this really made a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s also still much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , there i do as much more common , the behavior as that looks like that .
this is also such a paradigm shift .
that i think that this is always <unk> for success , just <unk> a app .
and when i take a step back in this natural user interfaces , where i have a voice to voice , by a language , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> and cursor to drive things , then i &apos;m more faster and more .
but that leads me to the point , when will the things become more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and see , what does that mean from the view of the <unk> , when is really something also intuitive ?
and this is for us people is always a little intuitive when i just have to think about it .
so , he seems to not like to think , but it &apos;s pretty simple .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive time is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means when we look at that we can use existing <unk> from something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as a creator .
that means i can just put an intuitive , human <unk> on a software and so to make the software .
now , of course , the question , what is actually so the <unk> <unk> of us and now i &apos;ve already tell .
this is the so-called <unk> .
this is using each of us and <unk> is an acronym and they &apos;re for orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
that does all of you all the time , but he &apos;s doing it unconsciously , and it &apos;s really intuitive or partly instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world in the world and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without the whole time that most people knew this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to a half of us , so in their sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be less often than a day .
now i can just see this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar like the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than that the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m doing this now , for example , i &apos;m orient to the orient , for example , <unk> in the case , i can look at it in the detail , and i can see that , i can also send it somewhere in the detail or you go to somebody or so on .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to try this by a <unk> .
she has already eaten pies .
but now , i interact to communicate with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of this , can now filter this and say , show me all the thing with chocolate for chocolate .
and have a interface in once , which is much more intuitive and very much natural .
because that i can grab things like the pieces , <unk> , and they come to me , is significantly more natural than if about <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms or other mechanisms or other mechanisms .
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to be able to be able to come on to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much , for your attention and please .
i want to leverage you to a very certain aspect of curiosity .
the first thing if you become a child as a child , as baby , is that they have care of them , right ? and depending on whether their parents have allowed them to play more , more or less , the more , the more , they &apos;re doing their curiosity .
and curiosity is not learning .
so all of those who are here are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , practically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give , + give up two grams phosphorus , and every day you have to take two gram phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we could only dismiss the <unk> by the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t take phosphorus phosphorus and make it .
remarkably , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re doing something about what &apos;s a <unk> , but not so much .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus by two years , and now now , through the <unk> world , in the world , in the world , in the world , as in all the <unk> .
alone in the last 20 years , <unk> tons are distributed in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take all on .
it makes leukemia of children .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
this is not protection .
this is like if i would say , <unk> your child , it only takes three times rather than five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think of that from <unk> to the <unk> , then our whole planet will be used to be in or later a cemetery .
therefore , from the <unk> to think of <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
in the moment we &apos;re building corn and 30 pounds per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare , or <unk> <unk> .
that means we lose in the ground about five times more than new educated .
we can look at this first shot .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , at the <unk> 20 percent of the age of <unk> now .
and because we &apos;re older , the <unk> are going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s they all in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousand <unk> .
we could reduce that to 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted on the solid components of the <unk> .
people are over the urine .
yes .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is shown with it , right ?
traditionally we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you see the people when you have the people , when you say , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you will <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a lifetime of <unk> , you get the earth .
here it says , the more you are <unk> , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then , the ants are about four times more than us .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one may have seen termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they work a lot harder than we and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , correspond to your weight in your energy energy energy energy energy .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do and as sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re going to see on the earth at all , you can see that , for example , we want to be <unk> here , right ?
you can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to dumber as a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees alone .
you &apos;ve already heard something about <unk> from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want dumber than the trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> is not allowed to go back to our own <unk> .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would go back into the cycles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
this means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they &apos;re all called that our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t this sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but if it comes to the environment , the highest , isn &apos;t that , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can just have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can different .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
right , we can <unk> water in agriculture in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re going directly to take the waste directly .
in china , a <unk> is still <unk> , like , yes ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to <unk> our nutrients .
that means the whole western <unk> draws by that the city always has taken , but the farmers never have been something back .
so by using the cities , the cities had to grow more because the farmers had to go into cities and the cities always had to bring their nutrients .
so that &apos;s why all western kingdoms are always expanding until they have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five years because you always were able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you invited to dinner in china in china , you expect to be long as long as you seek the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet as you can regain the nutrients .
that &apos;s really nice about this , if you do that , so agriculture generates , in a hectare of land , with five thousand people in favelas , can be able to produce chickens and pig are <unk> and pig and ducks and vegetables and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas to go back about 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , as much bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is of course <unk> , but the facilities carry itself .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so through the design that can easily operate a farmer .
that means that the <unk> go back .
and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve been built now over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of those facilities ever got <unk> .
they could just easily <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then the plant would be ruined about years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , as much bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , they write on , in germany , in the best process plants in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> .
because the <unk> plant could be best to get the phosphorus back .
and that needs to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s fair to do it .
we &apos;ve been deployed now over three years .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world .
so opec is a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace by other energy .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s not about making existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mostly to ask what the right is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland you understand that , of course , because in holland is the land on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife sad is sad when you have them <unk> , and they come with 50 &apos;s roses .
totally inefficient .
but completely effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six point of <unk> of their life .
this .
that &apos;s not not exactly exactly accurate because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> will .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but all effective , yes ?
a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
therefore , not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right ?
not to burn a little bit better and put it up to burn all the materials to lose all kinds of materials , but first to lose all kinds of materials , but first to ask , how do you make these cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
when i put them back to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with <unk> and a glass of water on that .
wonderful , &quot; a ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in love in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means all what counts in life is not about saving .
the whole <unk> .
we say people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , this is exactly the right , right ?
in every place where you &apos;re <unk> , from , yes , you create <unk> .
but the wrong thing .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
as we think of the north .
there is everyone there is <unk> .
when they walk , everybody destroys the footprint the floor .
because the floor is going to die from the mosses , and the wind and the water is washing the ground away .
if you &apos;re in italy , each footprint means that the water remains in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that will be a marsh .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how do you get your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not save , avoid , avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , as the people in the high bow of the car is that , right ?
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , for example , that &apos;s a liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build everywhere .
and they contains seeds of rare plants , so that they contribute through biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of course will be <unk> .
a tv washing or a washing machine , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things , the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , which must be so much that they have to go in biological systems .
the things that only become used , go in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
very direct advertising , and not for the company &apos;s company in <unk> per se , but for sure that they &apos;re going to help this business to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things more freely from it .
yes ?
so when i put them up to food and say , this is free from <unk> , then you don &apos;t help you all .
no , we lay out what &apos;s in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
but everything in it is useful .
these are the first shoes where they can <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> and the rubber rubber into biological circuits , yes ?
all of them is <unk> of it .
and if we succeed , of course , it &apos;s about <unk> , for nike and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and this is the half of all the <unk> in the world that causes through the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help , questions at the people .
hey , <unk> , power are you really serious ?
because this has already changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not so sure if they really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit of it .
but it goes .
yes .
this is what just been shown .
this goes .
we can do the things so that they do when they &apos;re <unk> , if they &apos;re <unk> , they can use biological cycles .
technical cycles is just as well .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done in the circulation .
that also , in every store , you can <unk> things .
if you come on this , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
when the waste is that .
this <unk> rum , is almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , you can change on <unk> , then you can grow up with a baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia or tunisia .
yes ?
alone if they take these <unk> , they <unk> , sterile and the powder to plant trees .
so the baby &apos;s <unk> for all the life , at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i started to set up an institute .
now , many people work there , and they &apos;re all engaged in them .
there is extra a club to get <unk> where everyone can get involved .
so no longer save , avoid , reduce , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you make the curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , that i &apos;ve written as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so in english <unk> , understand .
<unk> are translator heard the written notes in <unk> music .
that you don &apos;t just communicate as a word for the text into another language in a other language , but also to understand the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , so it has to understand a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do it with <unk> .
to translate out of the germans into english , can require more knowledge because if you then ask for poetry or even about poetry .
<unk> is illegal for <unk> what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just got the written of the written notes .
you think that the composer in the grades is exactly what he has imagined there .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about the same or <unk> , like a verbal way , if also , really seemingly <unk> , a landscape of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> is the smell of the flowers not to smell , the degree of the <unk> only to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
that means the interpreter of this <unk> use of <unk> into another , which is <unk> , non-verbal <unk> .
today , i want to translate you to something else , so <unk> , even once in a verbal language .
so a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing about german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to the equivalent of translation of translation .
so the music works so similar to me as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be able to read notes and make keys on the piano or the right place on the piano .
namely , this is only the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the letter of letters you can see if you can do the language .
so , you need for the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively understands or you also can be able to talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> begins similar to like a <unk> .
after you first picked up a piece of a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to take out to backgrounds to backgrounds .
you accumulate information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers itself .
you studied the works that he made before and after later .
you put comparisons .
the <unk> , writing it .
how do he feel ?
how were the circumstances of the society and politics and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at the ted pictures or watching literature .
but at the time , you &apos;ve also been a rich knowledge to know the composers that you play more often over , and it &apos;s always easier to feel inside it and feel .
the composer gets more to my friend that you live together with .
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now the notes all other than a <unk> record of composers , but just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make sense and significance .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these notes could be .
now for me and for the composer , and what you could mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of making a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes from my mind .
it has to be for me in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my concern .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have the experience , the piece that i used to experience as new as new as new ways .
as you &apos;ve always experienced a happy new day again , even though with the same rituals of life , up with the same rituals , stand up to work , so as well as as well , i also go back to the same thing again .
i went back to a day that ended seasons switch to seasons , my pulse continues to slow down when the morning , takes it longer to be coming back as to home .
i take the breath of the audience , aware or unconsciously .
all that changes me and all that influenced my experience with the composition .
all wonderful is when i stand with a <unk> on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea in and immediately , this answers will with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and whatever you can &apos;t have samples .
it makes great fun to make music , and they &apos;ve been experiencing as the audience , like the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as in 20 years .
there i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and therefore , on my palette of <unk> , on emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but then new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and long-term professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune of making him very early with 13 years , and so i was at my school classes on his classes .
i was 17 , when i took on one of his courses again , and played the last of the four movies by chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is so a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
there he did and mean , this ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but no significant memories .
i play the piece of all the years today , and it has always changed for me , even though not a grade .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again i read something new .
one example of it from a whole range . monet &apos;s painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he was translated the <unk> , as he saw her , as she looked at it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
now i was also older as chopin with <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he was only lived for <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look at the notes , even when i mean , you memorize .
to hold <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially if he died already .
now how do you start talking to speak the language of music ?
i said , yes , you need about just as long as the spoken language .
often the <unk> is that you just learn the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to read that before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes to the grades .
if all the fingers in time and right like it is moving in the notes , then they come out of it that sound together as music as music .
if that &apos;s all happening , the students get the <unk> piece .
interpretation of interpretation is not talking about the <unk> .
all right , there &apos;s a quick piece , that &apos;s a fast piece .
<unk> , slow .
according to and <unk> , f and b , et .
that &apos;s what most of you .
but even when you put this data , it still remains something technical .
and yet it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you don &apos;t forget something completely <unk> .
which is that , to make music on the instrument that can do and feel available before .
which is that .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because it doesn &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have it over another way , so about an instrument to sound .
people who never sing out , have never felt immediately with your body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the musical system is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more music even if it gets bored .
no need to whistle a whistle or sing .
every own music will <unk> when you &apos;re constantly going from the outside with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if if i didn &apos;t sing ?
this question i can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they don &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to figure out whether they can &apos;t yet , or learn how you can do these little muscles that the vocal chords , which are <unk> .
that you can train .
or c , because you have <unk> them that they &apos;re <unk> .
there i ask , how <unk> competently was this diagnosis ?
have you already put a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it today ?
or d , you may don &apos;t like music to have music and so much to do it .
but what i &apos;m going to do is regret because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also be <unk> .
well , so you see , on all cases , no one must be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , please , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , but sure you can say it or not .
because i don &apos;t believe it , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t give them to food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to avoid classical music because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to consciously and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is too <unk> or too sweet .
tell what you feel .
at the time , they also get claims and want to get something more spices , or taste even fine differences .
why do i challenge now from my audience who also listen to action ?
because the music is a language and a language is communicating .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the food that &apos;s about a chef or a chef and a chef has to be eaten and not just looking at recipes .
so please listen to if a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults are actively doing music or at least active music , a child grows to grow a child , to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you actually play them in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds quite different than before .
that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a piece of this today that &apos;s originally before <unk> or <unk> of three years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have <unk> .
there was no a instrument at all at all .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the <unk> possibilities of the modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that bach had had to sound on the modern wing , which is not a <unk> <unk> .
also from beethoven knows that he heard more than he was already deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time as <unk> .
so the composers of us rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they become audible by what they were just imagined in the spirit .
and also what you would think about today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what they could have thought .
thank you .
do you know what your envy is ?
were they jealous ?
and how did that feel about ?
suck .
i got a friend , which goes a <unk> .
if i come to this , with my little v w , and next to me , comes to this feeling .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do like that n big car ?
that &apos;s already lost half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford so n small car ?
and then i immediately get one , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward sense .
our organism invented a great method to get the same uncomfortable emotions like envy just to disappear .
you can also try this with words like revenge or <unk> .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or something about what you &apos;re actually probably familiar with is familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard you might have heard when people say , nobody has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them the view .
in a lie , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to test that he &apos;s completely different in mind .
he &apos;s just fooling them and not themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it to do themselves .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a self-deception .
they can get less easily , yes , <unk> or also get down .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> once a woman <unk> .
this woman has then replaced the portrait of her at all .
picasso says , wait .
it will be more similar to them .
on this point and when you laugh , they see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artists share you something about , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see , if they just look inside the mirror .
the artist shares you in such a portrait of what they &apos;re only familiar with when they &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork over again .
then this awkward feeling , it could not look like it , and it &apos;s going to be more similar to them .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to <unk> our <unk> .
and not just in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories appear again .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility from this true language , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true language .
but we should easily be familiar with that you can &apos;t say a woman somewhere else .
here it takes it that we understand under <unk> <unk> , over again .
we need to do this lie to this lie that we don &apos;t even have ever lived in .
we don &apos;t just have just in art , in the <unk> , but also in the science of science .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of people .
that the person from the monkeys should <unk> and , yes , it was at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said that &apos;s not true what charles there is writing .
the person is supposed to be from monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it is true , then we have to prevent the people know the people .
why do we need to prevent people from something when it is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we <unk> these self-deception , this feeling , <unk> from the highest being , not from such a organism , not from such a organism , which is there , there &apos;s something like an organism , which is something that is for us .
so , we don &apos;t have these things .
we need to prevent the people know of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slow this mechanism out of itself , which is leaving on something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to see you one more story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told her .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them about a student .
a <unk> student .
they like it special because he has a bend for sincerity .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen .
and because i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> in this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said my wife , always when a person in a moral spot is because of course we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do this once and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , this is the real truth behind us .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
i &apos;m interested in the <unk> .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , the firemen .
there he signed up .
and <unk> , you also say his teacher doesn &apos;t say , you like to put fire somewhere , and i &apos;m willing to go after the fire later .
no , it just sees a lot better when we show that we &apos;re in charge to eliminate the risks , the other thing if they just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> on that <unk> , in the <unk> , he knew he actually was related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell that loud .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and conscious who immediately can do something about it , and the things you know about it , and the things you know is that they can do much better for you and others .
so just then , just like these words that we &apos;re also doing in the language of the politically correct cure .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know when we tell this , the social event are very disrupted .
we can &apos;t just do this .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that works to work .
i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones we actually know in unconscious knowledge that it is valid to spread out .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example shows you what many of you know and some of them don &apos;t need any of them .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so something more intellectual , says about leibniz .
she &apos;s something that is not <unk> , physical physical physical physical physical physical .
and if you have people who have the solid conviction that they have a soul , or you can also say that the soul is like this , or you can also say that the soul is just from meat and blood , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead , dead .
and from this soul , you think that they kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called the <unk> in the latin , which is your mind .
and when this <unk> then <unk> over the people , then he &apos;s filled with it , with nature , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is so the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as a little sense of what to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to improve by a lie of our world .
because now you can use a <unk> .
you know , you know , from school .
this is now a <unk> that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something , but also the willingness to lie .
which is so to lie that they simply can use this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences coming out .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i stuck here in particular .
a third sentence , which immediately comes to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who has no soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say nothing .
and here you feel .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logical .
because i can claim everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the tells the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but critically , if i have right , then it &apos;s just true .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , it has no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness is immediately able to do something .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences and doing that as well as the opposite of the first sentence already proved and assumed .
because actually , we would have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it uses it , that two sentences is correct , and a third <unk> that looks like this , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do that as if it was actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present hand , we have a whole modern example of getting back to the <unk> .
this is what you have to do , one more <unk> topic , a <unk> from philosophy , present .
this has to do that we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was johannes <unk> and after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which consists of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is so a <unk> .
and if you place exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he wants to go first .
so he says exactly in the middle .
that &apos;s how the <unk> introduced .
<unk> forces <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately do this one slightly bigger , then he doesn &apos;t need sense and nothing .
he automatically runs the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , which is going to attract out of the larger pile , then they also have a sense of feeling like a free will have to give .
and if we &apos;ve also been here in <unk> in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> in brain brain .
there &apos;s a scholars , the wolf <unk> , and by him , you sometimes say , wolf <unk> claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can go back to the second sentence and can say , when wolf <unk> &apos;s right , then he has no <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper , you find that in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and he &apos;s so <unk> .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you &apos;d have to have to have to see whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as much as the first sentence of work wrong , as you need to take away the contrary to evidence .
and now you can just just do if you want to make ourselves anything , if you want to test people happy , when they want people to make people happy to practice a lie .
practice , for example , if you look at a man that you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , that &apos;s called prophet .
you can &apos;t call you , that would be a little political <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one , for course , <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already you have a problem .
because as they &apos;re preoccupied with it , they &apos;re not able to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man completely happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he led them to a <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t get themselves .
because actually , this person doesn &apos;t care about to prove .
he &apos;s just interested in it to be <unk> in front of the need to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way , you experience the magnificence of the lie of the lie .
and when you have a way of having a way to feel this <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed me to tell you if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event and has asked me whether i want to give a talk here and my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it fell hard from my idea .
and i may think maybe my <unk> i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it is of course the sum of all , completely many ideas .
i probably &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been <unk> in <unk> , because i &apos;ve been able to study robots in <unk> , now , today , i believe i kit , kit .
and then i got to berlin years after berlin , because i wanted to do renewables , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , also the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot line today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but something like &quot; n <unk> , from somehow , from a hundred watts from the square square square of the square square .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful that he had the word back again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because all left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
there was just that it was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you thought that evil suspects .
the place of the <unk> , but this was called <unk> and he made wind and the sun and we started in the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was told , i touched me because many , many , many beautiful statements were that i &apos;ve lived through .
i spent 11 years in the collective years , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one said no one , the <unk> , this was a completely <unk> thing , because i &apos;ve always got my great <unk> , if i &apos;ve always <unk> my great <unk> , because all the colleagues of my father always have him <unk> him , you have the money on your child .
it &apos;s preoccupied with insanity .
and that was really very , very <unk> and you also come in this same stage in that , where i &apos;ve been asked after 10 years , that &apos;s where i &apos;ve been asked after 10 years , <unk> , <unk> , in collectively , in the collective of course , whether this is really so the great .
and i &apos;ve got it up to <unk> , and then we got out with friends with friends , which then became <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in the world .
a <unk> , but also , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then put back to the next topic of the future , and we then go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that means that the people &apos;s going to tell you what &apos;s wrong , that &apos;s not about store , we &apos;re talking about store .
and i brought you a project that i want to imagine now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewables .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where you could use a memory of sense today .
on this island , this is the island <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s so the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you anymore ?
this is simply technological not .
when they <unk> more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
this is also me always telling me the politicians when they <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
but cannot be a problem .
but not right , we have seven percent and our web is physically , the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , which was <unk> , have started the first contacts with the island , calculate .
as big , as big to be a battery , so you have to be such an island to 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewables .
and yes , i &apos;m going to keep a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred <unk> , about a hundred <unk> on <unk> <unk> on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear plants , because this is particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that occurs with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission to do it .
this is fast .
you put this <unk> .
and then it looks like this .
in that always run three of the <unk> , two will always be waiting .
yes , this is the bottom down there is the burden .
we also get very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , in the rule is a <unk> system or a system , which can just <unk> in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel will <unk> <unk> and the wind , sun control the burden so that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables a year , so energy a year , not the performance of the moment , then you have to turn the petrol off the diesel .
this means , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can actually take the whole web .
that is , of course , if they &apos;re going to have an opportunity in any way .
this has so none of the world .
that &apos;s in the small scale , so you can also use your <unk> over a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do in <unk> ?
this is already happening .
but if you want several of these <unk> <unk> , and that should build a web , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get up on 70 to 90 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another one that &apos;s going to be very , very , very expensive , that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive and that will not work that you &apos;re doing that from batteries .
this is going to be a energy fuel , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas or <unk> , that will be it .
they have to go to a <unk> and not just balance and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s like with a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have a whole bunch of simulations .
and have wind and the sun and the load of the burden and came to the outcome , a very interesting result that you would have a middle <unk> of about 50 cents a <unk> per <unk> per <unk> per <unk> per <unk> per <unk> .
this was the very first calculation of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> when the <unk> five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would to be done ?
have entered investors , i looked for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build one for society again .
and here again .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with diesel and also not <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> on the island , has meant that we &apos;re very great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we sort of in the area of the island of the island of the region in the scale .
that means we were looking for finding the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is she in the &apos; 70s at the &apos; 70s , today , <unk> , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can take this performance for six hours to do this performance , and this is the battery that we have <unk> <unk> .
and then they put up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he sits there , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the back of the hall , it looks like this , there is the big amount of behavior , here &apos;s the big battery , where we simulate the web .
here we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to show the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we also can also <unk> kilowatts on the web .
this is what we see here again , again , the diesel , here again , all the individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was the hall then done , until today , <unk> basically all of the one system of electronics , in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the topic and the theme of the subject and all of them .
you have to communicate the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is about the theme that you &apos;re basically taking on this island today , this is what we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back at the moment and <unk> , <unk> , like this , in the island , we have <unk> the wind , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
and then <unk> offers <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can already start to integrate <unk> in the island , <unk> , you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you will not do that without memory .
you can <unk> through &apos; n , you can use nets , yes , you should do in any case , but you will never get on memory completely .
and that &apos;s like the message .
so many people come and look at that because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the diesel , you just have no longer this spinning mass that causes a certain inertia on the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically taken out of <unk> masses of large <unk> , wherever the wave is everywhere around europe .
we look at this web , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s <unk> point nine hertz , we start a couple of <unk> <unk> , then again , a little <unk> steam inside , then we come up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly rough .
if you <unk> this somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve at least 10 seconds to hold the web stable .
and in the time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that more , this spinning mass , then you have to replace this with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can two milliseconds of two milliseconds .
and then you can see what massive <unk> there is there .
and the message is now , we need to get on this rotating masses , when we sort of , our goals , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
then we have to degrade our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply called the power station to hold the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t want to , or <unk> , because that doesn &apos;t go .
and we &apos;re just trying to try to tell you that you can degrade the capacity that can break down by producing electrochemical memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to this purpose , the people are always coming and look at our <unk> on , basically our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can <unk> a piece of a long future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not insanity , <unk> , we have everything out , human beings never .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that , in the next 30 years , in the next 30 years , are going to have the same capacity on the world .
simple , this is going to come .
there will be such a lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve probably experienced in the last two years , that the scientists are asking on my side .
we have been able to get over 10 million <unk> , also , in german , now , a german web to <unk> .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this <unk> , to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewables is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in arguments , these <unk> , they &apos;re doing a own little web , which has a own little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
that the question is really simple , if they &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> anywhere on the world and become <unk> , then they &apos;re an island .
then you only use that , which is at the sun and wind there where they live .
and this is so a little bit of our vision from a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve said the power of energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and in that , the talk is , also , the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;re collectively allowed to be a collective and energy , there &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i &apos;m just going to encourage you to take you a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you have to really be pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , that &apos;s los angeles times , a day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , who had only two strings that had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles about this later a book , which was <unk> by robert anthony when steve lopez <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve anthony <unk> , and whose promising career was stopped by his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he lived on the streets from <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i suggest to you all of you , <unk> book to read or look at the film , so not just to understand the wonderful connectedness , but as she was going to get the instrument , when this pun allowed to come to get the <unk> , the <unk> to get nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke to a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo ma and hillary and about how the dodgers would never create it into the baseball world , and all of the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to the subject of music . and a few days later i got an email , in the stood for <unk> for me .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel <unk> a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric electric intelligence , and with <unk> , a trauma that has haunted him his whole life .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . they are sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of <unk> row , always that horror of his own spirit .
and in exactly as a <unk> , nathaniel , when we first was with our first class in walt disney <unk> hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how he wanted him to contaminate him in sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that he could break him in one of his states and that i could destroy him to the violin , and that i could destroy him about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i played , i noticed that in <unk> eyes were a complete change .
it was as if he stood under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response to my game was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding potato and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and started to play some clips of <unk> and asked me to play them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , started to talk about beethoven , starting <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it also connected to her a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and spoke about music , was from this <unk> , confused man who just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to have his thoughts and delusions with its imagination and creativity into something in something .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in us all in us , in our inner , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression gets us all , and moves , inspired and united us .
what nathaniel integration , put him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and him <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to go back to nathaniel music , no matter whether in walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i became musicians .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was bred to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be feeling to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked whether i could give you an event on the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem for our cooks has become . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have stood the oceans like we have beaten the forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so probably <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments about this . <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , take us tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
also doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , a company who tried to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
don &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow as far out in the sea , that they don &apos;t have polluted the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will not focus out of our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> too 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what &apos;s yours ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and at this evening , i was in bed , and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask me .
well , i &apos;m <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me a decent answer to me . until i finally did with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him as well .
don &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i have <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish came to chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind of art , the way you get to know your fish , you know the fish .
i &apos;ve eaten him first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it has kind of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let a fish taste so good after he became <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call it <unk> . actually he means <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way that you and i understand underneath .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by taking the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they urgently shorten water from the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds about what &apos;s a lot of birds .
and this is what bought a spanish company , bought the country green .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water around .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water back .
they &apos;re <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and doing his company and his company completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they rigid out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are <unk> channels and these density , voluptuous march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands , and i were <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> <unk> .
here he lifts a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here is a pattern of bundle it on the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and dropping into more <unk> birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had at <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it be so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what &apos;s eating your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s so a wonderful system is that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , phytoplankton , the plankton , which is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm who doesn &apos;t sustain their animals ?
later , i went on on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like this , of course , like any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was as if a director would have expected a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally distributed to the eye .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on the birds .
now , last year , there was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private community in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing that you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp are eating the phytoplankton .
so the kiss the better the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that &apos;s their success at the health of its predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 kilometers away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced me a kind of trip of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it back to the night ?
do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , i &apos;d just been quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i don &apos;t cook almost that .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> in <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last defenses before something into the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm which is their success at success .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he <unk> , because the water is flowing through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things with itself , of the rivers that tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow from <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves the water clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that literally measures their success , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , but not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do it , because his love , as romantic also , is <unk> .
you could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , actually taste good .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that the future of good foods is somebody somewhere on and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than only feed .
a billion people will be starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years .
feed grain at herbivores , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time has asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper . &quot;
that was the reason . it was this thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that allows quickly <unk> capital .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened now , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions to enable any community to feed itself ?
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it and it never produced something really good to food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the environmental model .
this is that on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
and businesses that don &apos;t be worlds for themselves , businesses , the recover instead of <unk> , farmers that are not just <unk> , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i really be honest as i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that the future is good , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;d like to tell you one of this today is that the totality of the data we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about the sum of their parts , i want to think about how we can see patterns that would not be visible .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are the most active and they are over there on the <unk> .
we can take one step further out and line the data then and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now when we go on and after old , we say 40 years , we say 40 years , we see that accidents are even the cause of the cause of people should be worried about .
and who <unk> is that this is particularly true of men .
so you realize that this is going to look at information and data in this way in this way in a lively <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data why not even for content themselves ?
what we now have here is the <unk> every single &quot; sport <unk> , &quot; ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in their lab .
with <unk> , she can dive in a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to put it back to me all of lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to take a <unk> overview , i could think &quot; okay , what if i look at everything with the topic of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you &apos;re looking at this kind of information , bigger , wider , <unk> , <unk> , then you &apos;re not looking for or not just <unk> .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little differently .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way of information .
i want to take this idea a little bit on with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single <unk> and put them on a little summary .
the summary contains a short picture and a symbol for the area that she comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are on wikipedia at the most popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
now , after i elected government &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that &apos;s most at the most time <unk> people in the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
this is just to realize when you go back and look at the whole thing .
playing on a certain of these summaries , i can then <unk> in the theme of time &quot; people in the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from the economy . there &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can do jump and a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the web as whether it &apos;s also a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what different surprise could be .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can take these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step back and jump directly to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why that &apos;s why you just look at the look at this way , in this way , all the <unk> can look at the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i kept there .
and i can tell everything i &apos;ve looked at today , again .
and when i take a step back , and i can look at everything , i can rearrange my course of the course of my <unk> . here , i went to &apos; <unk> , and here after live , or here after live labs .
and from here , i can get in the side and then call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation around and the internet on your head , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , so that we &apos;re starting to go from one to the other , and by making patterns , which would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and when we know , we might even pull out <unk> out of it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school , every day an hour per hour .
and my nose was always met in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> ways my deep <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this curiosity also showed in that i always was when i was not in school , walked through the forests of the forests , wandered through the forests , frogs and bugs and <unk> , everything went home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our eyes with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of miracles that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
so that &apos;s probably good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games yet , with <unk> , the whole imagery was , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . if we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and paint from aliens , robots , robots , <unk> and all this .
in the <unk> , i was always caught by the teachers , as i put in the textbook , hidden .
the creativity had to take out .
and something interesting happened to me . which was fascinated by the <unk> shows , was the idea of a totally unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly i would never get an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could enter , here on the earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic as all of the things i &apos;ve always introduced to me when i had read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york had done , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in front of buffalo , new york .
but the ocean but , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours under water . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , very contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean holds on , with the same intensity as ever .
and then when i <unk> a profession , was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way , my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books and so .
so films of the way , images and stories get together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m doing , from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in the <unk> , i could connect my <unk> for the <unk> and diving with the filmmaking .
so in spite of my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we interfered with <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out of this was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever seen in a movie .
so the film didn &apos;t put any money in the time , he just played his production costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was just as <unk> by the magic that came out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , <unk> technology and magic anymore .
so you saw something magical .
and that was what i found really exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even much further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on how this effect would be going .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . though , we have a little bit more money .
from these two experience based on , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend stan , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
the basic idea of this company was to be the phase analog processes with visual printers etc and start and start with digital <unk> .
that &apos;s what we then did and managed to have a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve actually created the company -- too slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; that the bar in a visual effects and <unk> effects was supposed to be created by <unk> , expressive characters that were made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar hit very nicely , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to create that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that will fall .
the <unk> i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet . it became a <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but secretly , i wanted to <unk> the real wreckage of the titanic .
so i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . but the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m convinced you by saying , &quot; we dip up to the wreckage . we film the real wreckage .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that , that your own imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really blew me out .
and the preparedness was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and everything .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning .
you get up into this capsule , then you put into this dark , <unk> environment down where no hope of saving , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as well as i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was literally obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science . it was all . it was something . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that didn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had seen before , and for the science at the time when we saw them , no words .
so that &apos;s really really <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i told me , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and will put for a while . &quot;
and then we began to emerge to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and exploring them with <unk> .
we returned to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and himself to look at the inner of the ship which was never been done before .
no one had ever explored the interior of the <unk> . so you didn &apos;t have any resources . so we developed the process .
well , there i &apos;m sitting now on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that &apos;s pretty similar and that i know that once the band is played there .
and i have to fly with a little <unk> of the ship .
i actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i would be physically within the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i took a corner of the vehicle , i always knew what &apos;s going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was left for months after we were the film .
because the set of set was an accurate copy of the blueprints .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made me aware of this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk> , and so consciousness can fit in the vehicle in this other form of existence .
it was really profoundly profound .
and maybe a small view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all sorts of <unk> , which i can imagine myself as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started what we saw in the bottom , for example , that <unk> , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . this is like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a <unk> system , as we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re sitting in <unk> and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , go back to russia , they go to russia , and then flies , flies to the international <unk> and take our <unk> with them .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was beyond that i took <unk> to the deep sea .
i took them up and <unk> them down to the world : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations . i took them to the vents , so i took them to take samples and so on .
we were turned together , but in fact , science , actually , in fact , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as <unk> , at the time as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of discovery of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m now thinking , a director needs to lead a leader , a leader or something .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of energy . by similarity .
all people think i &apos;ve been between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and he would have <unk> the nails on one towel .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it about the problem to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there is . you &apos;re doing it for the <unk> because of the strange environment that comes when a small group of people are forming a team .
because we &apos;ve made all of this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on years . sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have , because you overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land and says , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to explain the whole technology , and the difficulty of the world , when you &apos;re working on the lake , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the other thing , and the difficulty that have been through and knowing that you never can explain somebody .
there is a connection , an mutual respect .
so when i came back to go back to my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you <unk> his team and make its respect .
so this was really changed the dynamic .
so i was again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we <unk> &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that it didn &apos;t have before .
very exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were got to a half for a half four and a half years .
it changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who said we would have really good <unk> and transported on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get out of all of that ?
what do we learn ?
i think at first point is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , a young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
that &apos;s some other one for you . do not bet against yourself , bet not against yourself .
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; don &apos;t fail . &quot;
but in art and the study must fail to be an alternative because there will guarantee it a <unk> .
no important endeavor , innovation was ever done without risk .
you &apos;ve got to be ready to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you to the way . &quot; is not an alternative , fear but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and the surprising may be surprised because my <unk> on the foundation mainly about vaccines and seeds to spin the things that we invent and deliver to the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , right even more important than everyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing over many years . it &apos;s too much or too little rain . the things will change how it can &apos;t be their fragile environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
also , the <unk> for them is very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price , the <unk> would be far to the most effective thing .
well , the <unk> is like time .
in fact , the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s give us the price of cut -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> the <unk> carbon dioxide , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> result , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to change and so collapse systems .
well , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some cards , but not very many .
and there is certain ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we have to get down to a near zero ?
not enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different as to say , we &apos;ve got a 12 feet high truck , which has to be under a three-year-old bridge .
this is just to go down to zero .
well , we poke a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce it to zero .
it &apos;s still up .
just different economic changes have changed at all , and we need to reduce from <unk> increase and a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the amount of people , from the amount of people who have to bring the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s take a factor of one factor and think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of those numbers have to come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go .
first we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it looks at nine billion <unk> to move down to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor are the services we use .
this includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to do this services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make <unk> and less use , but in average , this number will increase every year , and so more than double , the number of services will be put on the person per person .
here we see a very <unk> service . is there light to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods in <unk> , there are lots of services whose energy are giving some individual benefits to 90 percent .
in other service , such as the manufacturing of <unk> , 105 : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , is the resources for improvements .
in all , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction three or maybe even a factor of sixth .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now going to go from 26 billion tons on maybe <unk> billion tons . and that &apos;s simply not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor in -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out the question if you can get that on zero .
when they burn coal : no .
if you burn gas , no .
almost any <unk> for electricity today , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i use the word &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some coming , others not .
in this case , we have to be <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i get this out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitoes and somehow the people that did .
the idea became really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that this was my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are a few natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all sorts of things like this , but they don &apos;t bring all of them .
we need solutions , either one or several who have an incredible scale of scaling and unimaginable , and even though there are many directions in which people are looking for , i really see five people who can afford these big demands .
i have tides , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
this may be a <unk> contribution and if you do better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my statement here is that we have to give up all those five work , and we can &apos;t give us anything because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there seems maybe simple , but that &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes from burning from the <unk> , capture under the <unk> and then hoping that it stays there .
there are some <unk> that &apos;s going to create on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get in 100 percent , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it sure ?
who can guarantee something , what literally many billion times bigger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
it also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are potentially soluble , and that you should work on .
the last three of the five of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and also they have -- although it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
to one is the density that creates dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
moreover , these sources of interruptions .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , she doesn &apos;t seem every day and just flies not the wind all the time .
so you have to think if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , a way , the energy is also in times if they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges on transmission . if we say that the energy source outside of the country is , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk of where the energy of where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension to the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , and this is what i found with the amount of electronic energy , which is what the world uses , and that &apos;s what i found is that all the batteries we are now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a great breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this happens when you &apos;re trying to say these <unk> sources about say , 30 percent of the rest of the energy .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
well , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies who work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are a lot to get together there .
bill big has several companies , including one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , making great things and interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
development has stopped in this industry at some industry at some time , so there &apos;s no great concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate reasonable whether it would work , but since since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that : right ?
and because you burn this 99 percent , the <unk> is very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today than <unk> .
instead of breaking your head , burn it , burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is incremental , a little like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; traveling reactor reactor reactor reactor
this solves really the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
this <unk> u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to achieve and then let &apos;s talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and still something of agriculture , hopefully <unk> and cement to be clean .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note says if we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s super important .
this will be an key feature of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 testimony ?
it should have the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to bring reducing reducing on the way . the less we &apos;re going to get down , the smaller , and then the temperature also will be the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things we are doing , which are not completely much to the big <unk> , only more , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to use these breakthroughs with <unk> and that we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> uses <unk> energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed in that wide because we need for all sides .
there are a lot that has to come together .
this is a wish .
a very productive wish that we invent this technology .
if you only take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose this wish , or i could choose this wish , and i could take this wish , i would take that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig in between the long-term and <unk> , people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the u.s. and rich and rich , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what things do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss these <unk> and they would be shocked by ridiculously low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> to control co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we have to lead dialogue and lead full and the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer to get all the big scientists , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works sensible , it &apos;s just in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> to find more billion to find more billion and the place of actually build the first of it .
as soon as the first finished , when he promised , it &apos;s all really clear , because the profit is so different than in <unk> as we know them .
to understand the right : this means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear <unk> , and then the process begins on the bottom and then working on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . today , you &apos;ve got to rethink the reactor over , so there are many people who can go wrong and a lot of control that can go wrong and stuff . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think about a column -- which she is buried , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that offers itself a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yes . well , what happens to the garbage : you can be a lot less garbage with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste that has already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in those reactors . this is our <unk> .
so this is what is a problem that was a problem that we fill in our own and so to dramatically reduce the <unk> during this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about different people in this world .
where is the biggest interest in how to do this ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t identified a place , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that wears in russia , india , and the people of the company was in russia , india , i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> and talked about how this is <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , that &apos;s why everybody who has a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , the <unk> and probability and likelihood of this is really going to be into life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent .
this is kind of the deadline that we have demonstrated the <unk> that we need to drive .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easy to hold it .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies that work , as much when their approaches work for their pilots to do for their pilots .
and it would be best if there would be several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the big possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would be even without the <unk> , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there is a liquid <unk> that seems something difficult , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty of this is that a <unk> has a million times so much energy , as one , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s basically the radiation , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league almost in a league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or similar .
there &apos;s a <unk> which is called <unk> , which is working with various techniques to <unk> warming , so we would get 20 or 30 years longer to <unk> us .
this is just a <unk> .
you know , you don &apos;t need this .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance because you can keep it wrong so you eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know whether the importance of this problem is , if you lead to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> if the things come up , or that innovation needs more than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for them to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that are doing with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is now , if you have all sorts of problems , if you have all sorts of problems to invest in something , and there &apos;s people in the rich scenario , and there &apos;s people in the rich world that you look at and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that that uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make economic growth , and then the skeptics will say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not interested in the fact that it &apos;s no carbon , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of this time , the <unk> of malaria , the <unk> , the <unk> of malaria , and so on that there is a dumb waste of resources , as there &apos;s better things we can do .
<unk> : now , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
they shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get to big <unk> , and here can disagree sensible people when you have something that doesn &apos;t be economically , and trying to fund this . for me , for me , most of the waste .
it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> and funded only the curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much less cheaper .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> , then only you can keep up the rich .
i mean , everybody from us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why is the research not talking more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he takes the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a thought i think of appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that gets supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to be the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about a meter tape , about a meter tape and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because it makes people work very fast .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since since since since , i conducted about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and there is something about this task , and there &apos;s something about this task , and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people start to orient itself to the orient .
you talk about it , you think about how it is going to look like it .
then you invest a little time in planning and organization . they &apos;re drawing and put spaghetti sauce out .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> structures .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time anymore , taking the marshmallow and they put him gently down to the top , step back and you &apos;ll admire your work .
but then , almost always happened , that &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; is because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more , <unk> <unk> than others , and among the worst is fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there &apos;s teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> <unk> , and among the best are new sons of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
as peter tells us not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how does this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids invested in the spaghetti time to be <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
in fact , that <unk> were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> is to do that they start with the marshmallow and put prototypes , working with the marshmallow at the top , so that she <unk> the opportunity to fix prototypes .
<unk> shows this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get immediate feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance to work with prototypes , significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of us lies at about <unk> , <unk> , half of that , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three is the highest , what i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but this is going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator at the team , will be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special qualities of <unk> .
they lead the process , you understand him .
and that team who fall down and look at the work will be significantly improving of the team .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical approach , you get about six that have robust structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s take the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winner .
what happened to this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price for home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practice with the same student .
what happened now ?
now she understood the benefit of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so from the same , that became bad team of one .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i can help digital tools and processes to help work , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is doing , it helps you identify of hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or performing to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this same simple practice .
and those of you who &apos;s interested in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , actually , this is a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task and that we use our thinking optimal how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that lies before .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do this as a machine .
a big machine , a cool thing , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room must be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in the time before there were cars or twitter or , &quot; america &apos;s looking for the idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of going to <unk> , to <unk> .
and this is what i get .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , you go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that had ever been on this planet , no matter how scale they do : health , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents filed this number on <unk>
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who was born today in new new new delhi , as long as the richest man on the world around 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve made the demographics of the earth in a way , like there &apos;s no war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . pop .
in the rich world , diseases exist that millions of us have even threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , things try to try and look at whether it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , one billion people on this world every day to bed every day .
this number rises , and it goes very fast , and this is embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappearing , and in case we don &apos;t break out of this chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s already .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country , to rape , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even destroy .
i think that really , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this holds me awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we also were also able to be able to make it reasonable as we can today .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think we would have to go back hundreds of times the enlightenment , in which we have to do progress in which we have to do progress in which we have about these things , more front than now .
people are moving into their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth will free it .
and listen , everybody has a right in his opinion ; even a right in its opinion .
but know , what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about immunization for &quot; the new yorker . a little article .
and i was amazed , on resistance , on resistance to what the most effective activity in the history of humanity is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that molecules would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules was in a certain way of nature in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i made on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;ll type , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who didn &apos;t <unk> me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as early .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking to ironic , with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what causes that .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , and sometimes there &apos;s no reason why not be so .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be rather skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand it .
take nothing than granted .
but now comes out of this : if you have to take the evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic in fear , as i never seen it and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with each other , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
plenty of studies were done to see if that was true .
plenty of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we think of anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see what we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe on a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic ways of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries on the world where the <unk> for measles .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
because there anyone here ?
did one one in the audience ever see anyone in measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country at all , but 160,000 times over the world last year .
these are many deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny , and people like jenny and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and illiteracy from of all of the oprah .
and that can make them because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , walk .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , except by vaccines , and he says about vaccines and says how much they are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and this is actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul was talking to paul in a public war , he can &apos;t tell no arms of the story .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
so you take them on , keep the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have this country now now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die back to it , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
what about <unk> ? take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine has written me a few weeks ago and i said i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she would not vaccinate her child against <unk> . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning anybody in lagos , and flies just after los angeles , in the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of this <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how this works now .
this is the planet that we live on . do not as if he doesn &apos;t .
we love it to lie in lying . we love that .
did you all have all their vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to make .
i know they &apos;ve done this because half of the americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data shows that all the time .
they make their urine . more than never never do .
this is okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> themselves that it can afford .
so we walk around , and where are we running ?
we walk into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious deal , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i have all sorts of props here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it ; it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , they shout the people in and say , &quot; what does it care ? let &apos;s make people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some <unk> who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where believe and magic evidence and science , you get into a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 400,000 people around because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , from which we know the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths deaths in a country that gets worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in which we are now in , is this fine struggle between the <unk> genetically <unk> and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it must stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every branch , every branch , every branch , each <unk> , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we did it in the last eleven 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand this .
we &apos;re re-engineering food .
why do we do that ?
now what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and do you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix us that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
she &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes , and sometimes the idea that we should not allow the science to do , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , and she holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shameful .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? re-engineering food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like cassava .
she &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people eating .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s only a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all the time in it .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask us : why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to take genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , more food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so much as far as we do , we think , not to be guilty of being <unk> colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation you want to say , &quot; you want to say , &quot; don &apos;t you want to go into this ridiculous machine and going into the future ? &quot;
on any case . that &apos;s what i want to do .
in the moment you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and far as far as it is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
since some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician &apos;s interested in it , it &apos;s as a &quot; you look at it as &quot; a deception that will be a real thing when someone thinks you &apos;re just stuck with it . &quot;
with other words , <unk> have been a measurable effect in some studies , the <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a <unk> or a kind of ... in <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body , a measurable effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
it becomes a deception to something real , because somebody like it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magician .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i even have learned him from <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
so see what happens .
the knife they can study ; my hand they can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeves .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve or out of him , i &apos;m just going to just <unk> my wrist .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s something moves . as long as i get here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes good , the knife will be held through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually in fact in its place that i can shake it , without the knife fall .
nothing moves in my sleeve or come out , no <unk> . and they can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often <unk> children who are interested in magic , because you can find a lot about deception , because you can look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you here in the room here in the room .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist , to make sure nothing in my sleeve or come out , and this is a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that that &apos;s the actual secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i put my hand from you , so you see them from the back of the back , and you see them from the back of the time , my favorite position , in which he &apos;s so extended .

there &apos;s somebody who had not been childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you &apos;re not aware that there are only three fingers , because the way he processed information , they don &apos;t count one , one , two , three , but they have as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not about this . and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s going to be stuck there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is by making myself , is going to cross through this movement that the finger goes back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show them your friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really got me really blown away me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and therefore that was an amazing thing .
and that turns out , if you provide a dummy placebo against a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just one round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you have the shape that they give the placebo placebo , for example , change in a smaller pill , and put this blue and put a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , though none of them -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill isn &apos;t so good like a blue pill .
what ? that really popped me out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not anything .
if you take capsules that are more effective than pills pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s at a end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dose is also a role .
a pill twice a day , not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
that also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector .
so in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our faith in us that &apos;s a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose something that is obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you need to reach to the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long . she &apos;s very , very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a little bit sterile .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and push through them to the other side .
if you get nasty -- if you fall out , i showed that a few friends last night in the hotel room and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to go quickly , you look for the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;ll be the first sensitive part here here .
you can see it in the same , you can also get <unk> if you want .
so , it goes so , right here , where my meat begins , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , so again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had in <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> themselves the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show it .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the <unk> come in now .
let me show you out of the closeness .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going to look away , look away , look away .
people back the back or the ones that look at the video at some time , will say , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it would be real impressive , he would say , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would be bleed . &quot;
okay , let me <unk> a little blood for you .
yes , here &apos;s it .
i would take the needle now .
i would show my arm clean and show you that there are not wounds .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of making a real real thing , i &apos;ll just let the needle put in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to look at a few times .
i hope you look very much . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people to count the number of books that were published in the past five years , and they gave after about 40 on the last five years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness .
there &apos;s very much <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of this tide , there are multiple cognitive ones that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of these cognitive traps .
this is true for <unk> , who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so confused as anyone else .
the first of these traps is a <unk> to admit .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not useful , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could take out , but in large and all the thing that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what &apos;s what makes well-being .
the second trap is a false experience and memory : basically , they are between happy and happy about his lives or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that makes well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who said he was heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was at the end of the recording .
and then he added , really pretty emotional , which has ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t know because he was <unk> , the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had kept what he had kept .
what really says that we could think about ourselves and over other people could think about two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present is capable of experiencing the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt , &quot; does it hurt when i get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the history of our life gets upright , and it &apos;s the one that gives you the question : &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself and the <unk> self , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this starts really starts with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it begins immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed from our experiences is a story .
and let &apos;s start <unk> with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who participate in a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clear more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had a patient had a patient .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients thought they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a a much worse <unk> of the <unk> had known as a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how she ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the thing that is worse is the where the pain is all at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and too later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing about ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as for b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from <unk> itself , b clearly had an inferior time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually be <unk> the <unk> of the patient as you just shake the tube as well to him .
this will lead to the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that a few minutes , you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a very bad thing , and you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a much better thing , because now you have patient a better story about his experience .
what draws a story out ?
and this is true for the stories that provides memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so a story of <unk> are turnarounds and end .
end is very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> self lives continuously .
it turns out moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i made this point -- you know , the psychological presence for about three seconds . what means you have about 600 million of it . in a month there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave there .
most of them will completely ignore by <unk> itself .
and yet , you get some sense that they should count that what happens during that moments , our life is happening .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use as we are in the world .
and as we use them , seemingly important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is about time .
from the point of view of ourselves , if you have a vacation and the second week just as well as the first one , then the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is not better than the <unk> vacation because there are no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> itself , time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , and decide what he had to choose , then you know what he &apos;s supposed to pick up , then you know what he &apos;s got less bad , and this is the surgeon that &apos;s going to be selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this election .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self , and they can think of ourselves as a tyranny of self as one , which is what the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need to do .
i have the impression that when we do vacation , that means we do vacation , largely in the services of <unk> itself .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve ever done in antarctica a few years ago , which i had ever had , and i think relatively often in terms of how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably &apos;ve probably heard from my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever opened the <unk> with the 600 pictures i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , this is three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours and a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , like a little appetite , i have a real question , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to give memories so much of the weight to the weight that we have experienced ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> all their paintings are crushed and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , you think of the sense of memories , you might get another answer .
why we pick up the <unk> that we find is a problem with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask questions : how happy are the moments in the life of itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good picture of happiness at the time .
if you ask for happiness &apos;s happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfied or pleased the person think about your life .
very different term .
each of those who are not different from happiness , and i &apos;m part to a lot of researchers about well-being , and i &apos;m one of explorers about well-being that we cleaned up on the same .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the <unk> itself is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization organization has a worldwide poll where more than half a million people are asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of ourselves .
and the main lesson that we believe is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how content someone with his life is , and it doesn &apos;t tell you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an impression of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about its size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s his life as eight on a scale of 10 of 10 times , they have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> itself .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what makes the happiness of <unk> .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly content with people who we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of ourselves , they will do very different things at the end .
the conclusion from what i said here is that we should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not focusing on the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you think of this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate are not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who are moving to california , happier .
well , your <unk> itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about how awful the weather in ohio was in ohio , and they will feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we told a few weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this gallup gallup survey .
is this something that you can do about because you have a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found at gallup is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness &apos;s happiness .
if we were looking at how emotions vary with the income .
and it turns out that under one income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample under another income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly happy , the poorer you will be .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not buying a <unk> , but that lack of money , or we can do this misery and we can measure this misery very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> itself , get a different story .
the more money you are worthy .
this is not true for emotions .
but danny , all the american commitment to life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in <unk> and so on .
is there an opportunity to make politicians that the country generally take a <unk> , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it is tribute to the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , they just happen and in other countries you just happen .
people are doing this , recognizing that you should think of happiness when you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study <unk> or whether you want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
as you can be lucky , very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
this is going to influence politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to think in the next one or two or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic will be , or should at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i develop now for 10 years . and my goal for the next decade is to make it just easy to make the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with playing play , more and <unk> games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you consider how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite appropriately .
three billion hours a week aren &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most biggest problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time .
i calculated that it took time for 21 billion hours for 21 billion hours a week .
this seems to be a little bit more <unk> , so i repeat it , so if we want to work like hunger , poverty , climate change to solve global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes exactly why i believe that games are so vital for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings of playing . so he has built a camera .
this is one of the classical expressions in play .
if you don &apos;t have a player , maybe give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a bit of fear , but very good enough enough , in the solving of a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some nuances here that &apos;s a sign of optimism . the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge of so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost near the imagination .
and when you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just a short victory of victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces on the world when we take the barriers to attack , the face of the next century , the face of the <unk> on the verge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it as &quot; in life i am bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m that &quot; in life i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former house in berkeley , california , where i &apos;m in my thesis in my thesis we are better than in the real life .
this is a problem that have many players .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though this is .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , in context with motivation to do something , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately , they &apos;re trying to solve the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to try to try the <unk> again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , when we poke on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it possible in play , to think , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from playing reality ?
so i looked like world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the epic wins in <unk> as possible .
so first , first , if you get in one of this <unk> , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are ready to <unk> a <unk> mission , and it immediately goes .
but not just any mission , but a mission to fit perfectly at your current level , right ?
so do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn <unk> . there are always something important to do .
and there are plenty of employees .
where you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who have to work with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in the true life , that sense that at a <unk> of a <unk> of employees .
there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have driven by &quot; level up , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; cats &quot; or &quot; 1 . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the true life .
if i &apos;m leaving this stage , i didn &apos;t say : + 1 : a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not getting in the true life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , anytime on the verge of <unk> , that we would rather be spending our whole time in these trade-offs .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound <unk> .
but to see it in context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go upright .
so the first way to go .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re doing play with play , that only sense of the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that we use this whole time to play the time , actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , continuously creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
consider this interesting statistics , which recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person from today with intense <unk> has spent 10,000 hours to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours in the united states , which they spend in school , from the fifth grade , by the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a full of <unk> , in the young man , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of them have the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that when we spend 10,000 hours to the 21st century , we will give up to the 21st century .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever , whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a total generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have never seen human potential for available .
so many people have we currently have in the world who spend at least one hour per day with <unk> .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and working on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so , especially in india , china , brazil .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is to master us .
here are the four things i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do , immediately to do a hurdle , together with believing that we have an urban hope .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth trying to try and go .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we are people more than we played with them , even if they defeated us evil .
the reason is that there is a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that someone time with us is that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to the <unk> .
so this allows the <unk> of <unk> from bonds , trust and each other .
as a result of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , like a <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier , working hard to work hard as if we can relax or do nothing .
we know that we work as much as human beings when we do hard to do hard to do .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it to become part of awe of awe of the brain .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go into the same light . you know all of wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest staircase of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information across world of warcraft on the internet than over any other topic in every other new new world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as individuals .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real one .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to witnesses less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that that makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so he says it &apos;s totally logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
there was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and when you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
the <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
it was supposed to be such great famine that the king of <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
the people suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so very much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> surviving , she survived so 18 years of these famine , by using a day eating and the next time .
as well , i think , let &apos;s put games today .
we sit in games to get out of the real world .
we sit out games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we bring ourselves out of play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king decided , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the victor to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and made up for a new home . they just let many people go back to how to survive and looking at the rest of the area where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> that then later the roman empire , the same economy like the old <unk> .
so scientists recently came to this notion that <unk> &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global <unk> , which could explain almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this could be this crazy story .
maybe they actually saved your people by playing for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about these <unk> , and so much about these <unk> , that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years <unk> , we have warcraft for 16 years .
i argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half their civilization to search for a new world . so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should put in <unk> that half of us have spent an hour with playing games until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you will ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and this question i &apos;ve got my work in the institute at the institute of the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it presses how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome . and then people make people to make this idea into reality .
we think we &apos;re victories wins and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very short three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> , so they &apos;re going to be realistic in real time , so they &apos;re going to be able to live your real life , and then you have to figure out how much oil is there , and then you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it would be true . and we ask them to make videos or photographs .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players . and we &apos;ve been accompanied it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have keeping them in play behavior .
so we have a bigger <unk> game a bigger , higher goal than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute .
the starting point is computation is that the people left only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> . &quot;
so the call to a player , to sign , we have almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientist , the <unk> and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on march 3rd . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end the game , you get the award from the world bank , &quot; social <unk> , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and funding them to learn , social gridlock .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , who are going to be able to imagine their own social company to save the world .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , believe , is going to happen next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree to me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make tight social nets , <unk> and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play major games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play .
if i went into the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m able to create any future imaginable : that we can create every future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what me had noticed a few months ago in writing an article of paper .
i always have my <unk> hand right now , but i was working with the wheel of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been able to <unk> in my life , which means &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; disabled , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so injured , also hurt , useless and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , stability . &quot;
i read this list from a friend according to and read , and i had to stop reading , but i had to stop reading , but i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading after this <unk> , and that with <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the issue has been quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i started to build my sense of elementary school , and so started to create my sense of self outside of my family sphere and to shape , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and god was thanks to a <unk> .
if i would take this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone could be positive in any way , whose lives can be positive in any way . today i &apos;m going to have the opportunity to be celebrated .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and expected i find a <unk> contribution .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
especially the last two words , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with this words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and as we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks , really believed that the pronunciation is a great force , because what you have is a great force , because what you can do loud .
so , what do we actually do <unk> -- one disabled people or a powerful people ?
alone , an people who call <unk> as a child might be enough , they &apos;re <unk> and beliefs <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be fun to open the doors ?
a man who opened for me the doors was my pediatrician at <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name is , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t get correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just made for children as well as created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to start repeating individual exercises , rather than this thick , elastic <unk> -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated them . i hated her . i hated her . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a <unk> child with dr. p. and so trying to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these things were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , <unk> and young girl , you &apos;ll just tear one of those tape .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i wanted to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , but he actually made me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask myself today how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> man .
this is just one example of many of how adults can encourage the imagination of a child .
but as we already prove <unk> examples of the <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we all want to do : it would be every single thing to see itself as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were triggered in many cases of a technological change .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , you can tell , of course , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , which allow people to use their ability to use it , which is to be able to use a own identity , and we have to redefine our own identity , and they can be able to define a own identity , and they can be able to define a own identity in the world , orient itself .
so maybe this technology shows this technological change very clearly because there was always a other truth of society , which is that every human ability to adapt something really <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always feel like me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable to me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable to me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable with people , and i think gradually i understand why .
this phrase from learning is living from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , as if my life would be so successful , and as if my life would be so successful , as if my life was able to escape , or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re in the challenge of the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even more .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> is no obstacle that we need to <unk> to get our lives better .
<unk> belong to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact or the hard of the <unk> of an people .
there are in life in life and challenges , and these are just <unk> real and every person &apos;s real , but the question is not , whether we come with <unk> or not , but how we come to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people who we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepared to be able to get good with it .
and we &apos;re not going to put our kids when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be the medical fact to be amputated and to the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and in fact , to be honest , the only thing that i had to put apart with is that the world is constantly saying , she could describe me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart , and even a forecast , hard truth about their medical reformation , or even a forecast to the quality of life that you expect , we need to pay attention to the way someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the concept that just watch what &apos;s broken in one , and how we repair this , for each other disability than the pig &apos;s disease .
if we weren &apos;t holistically treating people holistically and not all its forces and possibilities and acknowledge , we create to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we <unk> a man who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and we &apos;re focusing on all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not have these <unk> times or deny , we should not try to avoid them , and we should be able to avoid them under the rug , but it &apos;s about the <unk> opportunity .
it may be more likely to be more about saying that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to embracing them , but that we &apos;re open to a <unk> , and maybe to dance .
and maybe we create it , <unk> than something natural , <unk> and useful and feel so much of their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 of charles darwin and when he wrote over 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in something very true in human character .
i would rearrange it as well : not the most powerful of its way , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the thing that can adapt to best .
of conflicts comes creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> from the fight of human mind is defined by conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest qualities of people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re carved on , if we &apos;re really tested .
potentially , that &apos;s exactly the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> is for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
once honest -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical one , but not the normal one , and would you really want to know these arms , gray person , really want to know if there were you ?
i think , rather .
it would be great if we could have this paradigm against another thing or the strength to create it even a little bit of a little dangerous to formulate , and they invite to make their own special and valuable skills in society .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always got people from the members of our society to be useful to be useful and a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence of evidence 60,000 years ago , the neanderthals had been worn older people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that happened , because the <unk> in the <unk> of this human people was valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable treatment .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summer and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you shouldn &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i brought her from her mother to her mother . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it made click click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who knew just from stories about this day , because i knew of course , quite typical to my birthday was two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been pointed after you , and i only had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you could never run up and never be a independent life like other kids , and then they &apos;d just lead me to lie . &quot;
really extraordinary , i found that he gathered my whole childhood out of my whole childhood , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , whether i had my scholarship to <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his favorite x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor is for the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> went on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you don &apos;t get a little bit other , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get kids to get a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with that , two different things .
and also i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of the time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 years , whether i had my prostheses from flesh and bone , then i would have no second <unk> .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experiences .
and maybe this change could happen also , because i &apos;ve seen so many people who opened up the doors , instead of trying to be able to hold me to me , or i wanted to make an idea of <unk> .
look , it takes really just one people that shows you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own , internal forces -- and the human spirit is so <unk> -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create this , and open a door , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them up to open the doors .
the actual meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is in one , the potential <unk> .
again , what potential do we want to use ?
in the 1960s one case in the &apos; 60s , <unk> were transformed into <unk> <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student is going to be <unk> harder , get the better teachers .
they then have asked over a <unk> period of time with a &quot; independent &quot; &quot; very well . it was told that they were very smart , and after these three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear the heart of the <unk> , it was just enough .
and as well , it was after three months .
but just those who were still in school -- besides the students who had thrown out the school .
in this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just told you that are the <unk> and that the students with the grade , and as they &apos;ve taught them and they treated them .
the only real disability is a spirit of a mind that has broken up a mind that has no hope . he finds nothing more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and our innate ability the imagination .
but if we create it to support the human spirit , continue to help themselves and other people around themselves , and other people are putting our forces really .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and the poem knows god , not the god of the name , but the poem knows god , but the god who knows only four words , but the god , he always says : come to dance with me . &quot;
come on dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are currently ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more accurate and faster and faster .
or want to be <unk> , stronger , more power .
do you want to be attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always coming to more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as you have creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is this all just fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay with &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense of the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those are not the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the <unk> -- and maybe you can take a glimpse of kathryn &apos;s book , which is about being wrong because nothing in the other talk will make sense for you .
but if they accept biological evolution , consider this : is it only about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or matters too ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i have put a bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , they &apos;ve had success ; it has its surroundings .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , there was 20 or 25 different <unk> from hominids .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the biggest part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells pretty much .
now , is you realize that we can pull out of it and the mechanisms of a bacterium to produce the protein of human <unk> , which is used to treat a diabetic &apos;s protein ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about about bacteria is that each of us in our gut of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to cells in our body ?
maybe 10 times so much .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , is <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all nutrients that they could only want to provide without any effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> , <unk> the outcome .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the first <unk> of creatures , perhaps about three to four billion years ago -- the first <unk> of creatures -- the first <unk> of creatures -- and then the human species , which is what &apos;s in the last <unk> years .
in this giant unfinished symphony of the universe , is the life on the earth just briefly , the animal kingdom , like a single length of sync , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s we .
this also represents the <unk> of this speech , so i hope they liked it .
now when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was intrigued by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in the power of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue in both <unk> .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms arrived , the things began to change .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the rest of the body will <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of our body in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it came to my increased doubt .
i came to this to understand the feelings of george burns , who <unk> his show his show in the 90s in the 90s .
and one night there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
he says a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal of <unk> , as the objective of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to recover the health after a disease .
i wanted to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about treating the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i &apos;ve developed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> to the next level of the orbit to go into the sea .
i think we would all have the mood , and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to achieve it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest lives .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily <unk> the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and that &apos;s where fish would survive , if fish were there , they would have been able to have a vacuum in a <unk> environment .
so , what means when we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and most importantly , we &apos;re going to say there &apos;s a number of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reasons for that would be that it &apos;s been done by medicine , we &apos;ve done a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and from the population .
and second , we as a species , we &apos;ve got our environment so <unk> that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we hike and circulate us so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional way , of course , imposed from nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , when we colonize a species , it will colonize insulation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new evolution that isn &apos;t just natural , but led from us as <unk> in decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s see the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men as women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think if it wouldn &apos;t only be the gender of your child , but also in the body of genetic adaptations that can heal disease and prevent .
what if you could make the genetic change to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes become increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion pairs of the human genome to a price of about 10,000 and in the room from about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long long until the reality that it will give the 1,000 human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago a week ago , gave the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who were encouraging the natural process of evolution to work faster and <unk> proteins -- which is <unk> arnold . &quot;
a few years ago , the creator of the scientist was awarded to the scientist <unk> for his research in which he took a <unk> <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes -- to take them to a pluripotent stem of stem -- a cell potentially in your body to be in your body .
these changes are in coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin into bacteria that can make viruses that are not just protection of themselves , but also the immunity to other viruses can serve .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
this is all today , and in the future will be much more possible .
then imagine two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if they could change the sperm and <unk> or the <unk> , to make your children a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science can allow us to prevent disease to prevent disease , could also allow us to prevent <unk> , <unk> -- better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that allow them to allow them faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years , and maybe even over the next hundred years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , the more more friendly ?
or will we be selectively controlled different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society form and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
and most of all of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to have to make this decisions ?
in good like in evil , and before you think , these decisions will be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or one else , which helps to stand up and go up and go up and go up .
we at berkeley in berkeley , this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else as something that you put in the morning and that gives you extra strength and that will continue to continue to keep their speed , for example .
this is actually the true one of human and machine .
but not just that -- it goes together and connect them to the universe and other devices out there .
this is not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers that wears about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s a request to carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some important complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds about <unk> terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows it to operate deep to living , to carry and highly modified movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and raise my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re so far to imagine our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s now take our view on the wheelchair users , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people , the world &apos;s estimated in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , which was in the <unk> of her life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair was hit by the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or the wheelchair is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the realm of mobility .
let me introduce you to you now that by amanda <unk> , who was worn at the outcome of 19 years ago that she could not walk over 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , our <unk> .
it &apos;s got sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> , which they move forward in this kind of <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and <unk> as a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every movement and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after this , not long after this <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to go to me and learn to drive back and drive even with the hands of wheel .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for amanda , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty of poverty , i <unk> a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> of the fire .
now , in our city , in the age of volunteers , you have to be pretty early in the <unk> to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at the <unk> , i had pretty good opportunities in that .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she was standing in the <unk> and <unk> under a screen outside in the cabin , while her house fell in flames .
the other volunteers who came out of me was -- call him <unk> luther -- would we get to go into the house and was asked to save the dog and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was lost up .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who could tell for the rest of his life , he was going to tell people that he went into a <unk> house , just because he was faster than i did .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hope was to me , but i went to -- the stairs , walking down to the hallway , at this point , at this point , at this point , at this point , at this point , to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back to the bottom where i met my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our fluctuations out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his substantially more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> gave a letter of the <unk> , where she was <unk> for the brave use of her house .
one about everything is afraid of kindness : somebody had brought her a few shoes .
both in my profession as also in robin hood , as also in my <unk> as a census , i &apos;m witness from generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the acts of altruism and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room in this room and see people who are either going to be a <unk> success or on your way , i want to offer this memory : wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you give it now .
use them in a <unk> room where they put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a human life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;ll just come back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where the women lead the <unk> with sex &apos; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the river of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately we have this aspect of human evolution in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the prize .
during chimpanzees of large , fear are led to the <unk> of <unk> females .
they really have come up there , because this leads to a <unk> society , in the deadly violence far .
but unfortunately bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the depths of <unk> <unk> , and are the observation only hard accessible .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of a violent argument -- the arena of a violent argument that has been used for decades and almost so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are at risk of survival .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> lead to you don &apos;t even have a stadium with <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a smile to hear the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflicts and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love it to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s just fundamental for engaging with connection and the care of tolerance .
this is what we learn and the rules of the game .
play increased creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about energy production -- diversity of interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you observe bonobos at stake , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight out of the wild .
first one <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think in <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of saying , &quot; they put him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it like him , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are distributed , both in both to people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it shows the <unk> of the game -- and also , as the play is the game of trust as well as also -- while it makes tremendous fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> and it can take a lot of forms of which some of them are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the intuitions again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think exactly how you play it alone , and we &apos;re <unk> borders of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact . and the unexpected measures that we form is the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a smaller <unk> on the insights , the bonobos in our past and present .
but she also true a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through bigger creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but will we make the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s crucial .
for bonobos and human beings are equally made of teeth and claws alone .
right now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , may be <unk> at the <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re the creativity of <unk> and the wonder of <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 , at the same moment , at exactly the same moment , every <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to do too much time , because if you can imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case the sperm <unk> , that hits the x chromosome .
and in the other case , this is its sperm on the x that hits the x .
both are <unk> , both of the fire .
we still come back to these people .
for most of my work , i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studying studied , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal body -- as they <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> , as they thought about body .
the other hat i carried in my work in my work is the activist as <unk> -- or , as i say , as i say , as impatients , the patients who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i just give you a couple of examples of the kinds of <unk> that &apos;s not the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> , the <unk> , which we &apos;ve all been growing up with testes .
and that &apos;s why the testes are going to be off at the palm stage .
but because this individual individual were missing receptors around the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body has more of the typical female results .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes mostly until they reached puberty and grow their breasts and develop their breasts , until someone &apos;s coming up to the way that there is something else .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of <unk> <unk> and uterus , in fact , in fact , they have a y y .
this is important to understand that you could actually hold this person for actually , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called something called <unk> .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> that are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think -- i don &apos;t know my actual woman -- i don &apos;t think i probably have the typical <unk> -- most women as i actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually have a brain that was that more <unk> , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> isn &apos;t only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of an 19 years ago , who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had to find out that he was <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in utero , his <unk> was so strong that they created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> became male male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody had something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he &apos;s in <unk> , that the doctors found that he was inside the female female .
okay , just a quick example for a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something that is called <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason , why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> twins , is it <unk> -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason for them often made different interventions , is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomic characteristic goes with a certain identity .
so we &apos;ve got the concept that a woman is called a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be supposed to be an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re confronted with a body that is actually something very different , which is confused us in terms of this <unk> .
so we have lots of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve experienced in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender at the <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in berlin .
a lot of journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us if <unk> <unk> female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that they don &apos;t have this test .
we know now that gender tricky enough is that we have to admit that nature &apos;s nature &apos;s not going to say to us between male and female and <unk> and <unk> ; we are that that &apos;s what this line is as though , of course .
so we have such a situation where , where the further our science progresses , we have given to so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve kept for robust anatomical <unk> , which are very simple <unk> , a lot of <unk> than we &apos;ve accepted .
and this is not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out as much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
at our observation , we came into all sorts of <unk> areas .
so we push to the case that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we only differ by a few <unk> ?
as we keep our science further forward , we get increasingly in a zone of <unk> where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas we see that to the <unk> , in our current culture , in our current states , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard conversations about what point is to people , so that he &apos;s a other right than fetal life .
we have very difficult thing today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors used to have never been able to struggle with the question when someone was dead .
they just kept a feather under the nose , and when they moved into it , she didn &apos;t bury them .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , you bury them .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today where we take people <unk> organs and take them to others .
and as a result , we got us at the fight with the really difficult question when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have more categories as used .
now , you could assume that the whole crash did not make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much insecure than we thought , makes me tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of consideration .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to do first that i am a big fan of fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which what they did , and it &apos;s not because of the music , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> happened with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were made from my view , and that &apos;s why that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radically , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember our fathers were the concept of the monarchy the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was taken on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had to have political power to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to father and so on .
the founding fathers back that idea back and replaced it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created .
they <unk> the field of play and decided that <unk> , the similarity of things , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that part because they were part of a <unk> system , in the two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , clearly , many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things , like an supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very pool of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of this managed to be a concept that was a concept that was a concept that was a concept .
and so they have really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about this , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened to this ?
for example , the women who used the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the fathers that says that we should not have a uterus and <unk> , &quot; that we should not have a uterus and <unk> that we should not have to have the <unk> , etc . , using rather ownership , etc . . &quot;
and women <unk> this successful .
next was the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin color , which are emerging in anatomical differences , again , again , successful .
we see the same at the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all of the similarities , we have to start asking in question why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , you mind , i want to sustain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish like a human rights as a man .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to sex with sex or to get married .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that makes sense for me , and that we think i should retain .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it are and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures who were <unk> in the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both middle of 1979 at exactly the same day .
imagine one of them , maria , three months <unk> , she was born on the one june of 1980 .
henry , on the other side , will be born by <unk> , so he &apos;s born by the 1 march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months <unk> , would get all kinds of rights three months ago , henry -- the relatively <unk> sex to choose the right to choose the right .
henry needs to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find another <unk> about what their rights are .
henry , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s going to be male , he can now be moved in , what mary needs to worry about .
maria and maria in all states can &apos;t perceive the same right , the henry in all states , and to marry the right .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry one woman in a few states .
so we have the permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question : what are we going to do , because our science makes this progress in anatomy , that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels like the science of the autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we have to pull somewhere a line , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y y system .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of history i told you at the beginning of the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream talk .
he says we should not find people to &quot; their skin , but after the property of their character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are you judged people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of golden <unk> , which i know more than some people i know .
i want to be <unk> that i probably read some bright <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , more intelligent , more intelligent people than some <unk> that i know .
so how should we <unk> the question after the properties of character ?
it turns out as a really difficult .
and a part of me wonder , what if the content &apos;s content was something that would be in the future <unk> -- using an fmri ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make themselves thoughts about questions about questions about democracy .
in our efforts to build democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it is in iran , where a man who feels given to other men with death , it &apos;s been punished by death , it &apos;s ready to negotiate with a <unk> , in which case he may remain alive .
the states of this kind of exist in us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon with which i talked about a couple of years ago , which had a few <unk> twins , in order to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i put with him , and he asked him why he did this surgeries -- it was his answer -- it was his answer that children would be very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , did they consider political asylum , rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without changing the state .
so i think we must be leaders .
all right , just to end , i want to notice that i &apos;ve been talking very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look like , or looked like we had the mothers involved more involved .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and that &apos;s what i think there could be different types of insights that are produced by different types of anatomy , <unk> when people use a <unk> .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the domain of <unk> .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways how they think and in the world act .
what we &apos;ve experienced from <unk> studies is that women , in average , but on average -- not any , but on average , that tend to be complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable , very much attention .
and that &apos;s why we think about this , we have an interesting situation before .
and years ago when i did a graduate student , which was my interest in feminism , which was my interest in feminism -- i watched as a feminist , so it still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism was female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is going to resolve it about gender about gender , so that &apos;s why he &apos;s not not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is to be called it , it could give us something , in the average of the male brains , which makes us <unk> social relationships for <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so , where the founding fathers were extremely <unk> were protected as individuals in this concept , is it possible that when we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we can &apos;t just be able to protect them , but how we can worry for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we have democracy to think about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think of identity and more about relationships .
so that if we try to create a human connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , to every opportunity to find a different <unk> , crazy outfit , to carry and photographed in the last time and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> on the environment and also that in my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars for serving my dollars for a good purpose ; i see quite unique , and it &apos;s shopping to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody get with so many <unk> with ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve got bet that i would carry all other things i &apos;d want to wear if i just came to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have heard of me as the woman who here at ted in their underwear , means that , i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i really want to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe or not , from this <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has got me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you carry <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will be totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life with trying to be myself , and adapt to me at the same time .
be just who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just understanding them , they &apos;re going to value it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw as if i dress up , or that i remember their seven-year-olds .
i want to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you look at something good , then it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize the moment for them .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and the outside of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : <unk> <unk> in everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without telling a word .
it was always been proved to me and again , when people came up to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all over .
because the lesson that i try this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to be emotional <unk> , because the corner is always going to give me another crazy , <unk> information that only focuses on me when i just love a little bit in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
so if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally in italian , and every boy in italy , but the reason why i &apos;m going to show you this thing in the formula one in the past decades in the past decades .
some time ago , it was so that if she wanted to win a formula one race , they took their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , then she won the race .
now , nowadays , if you want to win a race , in fact , as you want to get a race in real time , some thousand sensors in real time , some thousand sensors on the system , and then they use them to use this car , and then they &apos;re going to move back to this car and change things in real time .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consists of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what today is interesting today is the <unk> begins in our lives .
our cities were going to be in the last few years , just equipped with networks and electronics .
they get to computers in free .
and as computers in free , you start reacting to other ways , they &apos;re seen and powered and powered .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the land , but 50 percent of the world population there are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , it pulls all this sense and power in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli : for moma later , as the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start talking to us .
in some sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this changes radically the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo was the moses shaped , he means he took up the hammer , and he was still able to see a little place <unk> and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you don &apos;t do ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to go to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment .
let &apos;s start with the vision .
now the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is in truth one of our labs .
it was formed four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done there was actually a really new kind of network that was used on the world -- this is a <unk> -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> information from this network that are going to be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was when the <unk> won <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in italy , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won &apos;t .
now look at what happened on this day , only when the activity is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , before play .
you see the top of the time .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and move .
the game begins in -- silence .
france does a gateway . &quot; italy make a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal play .
first phosphorus , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to celebrate .
she saw the big rash .
the next day , went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the image of the space of space , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the rash of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so quickly , another example for feeling : this is not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
well , today we know all about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows them all the potato chips , which is a mac computer , as they came together .
but we just know little about where the things go .
so we actually actually designed some little markers to pursue the garbage as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve been helped to tagging things more than a year in seattle , the things that they can see -- different kinds of things as you can see -- things that you would just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage with the garbage and started to pursue it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
of seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that when we see every day that the cup we throw away , not simply that she is still anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away there is still there .
and if we would show that the people , then we can move a behavior forward .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague on the mit , <unk> <unk> , could take you much more about this , and the many wonderful things you can do with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we have seen on the beginning of this , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did in <unk> , in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> , which came to us and said that spain and <unk> a beautiful tradition in public places as part of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a <unk> <unk> , imagine that tubes in front of these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves that open up and close .
they cause something like a <unk> with <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall off , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and he will open up to make them <unk> as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it made him very much .
and we got the mission to design the nest entrance to design .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach him , it will open up and put them in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy when you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to tell you the roof of people who were there , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just like the architecture almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that open the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was more fun in this night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
but reality is always unexpected .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have small helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you &apos;ve seen earlier , which moves with other , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is , not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then this could just be a 3d cloud from <unk> that you can walk and move through which they can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> by creating a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are run .
it could have a impulse to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatnot .
i want to show you something to first .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater of new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as momentum for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the various <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time , and a <unk> .
so that they can feel the whole movement .
they can do that all the time .
but then if we &apos;re all <unk> , you can play with it and with color and <unk> play .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible pulse for <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re talking about people to do something and change the environment -- almost like something like we call it how we call a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine each of a small donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing of what happened last few years , the last few decades is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge and power it through the internet .
today , we can see for the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- can we move from the digital world from the world to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this means something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can make us the next challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually actually engage the people in which they &apos;re collectively doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is back a cloud from <unk> , in the same way as a cloud of particles is out of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical shapes in london , but with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different types of experiences .
you can actually look at it from below the bottom of 2012 , and more than sharing , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like london new <unk> .
you can get in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , my context is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated by nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first <unk> .
myself , awe .
my heart came out , i was <unk> , while i tried to believe what was me .
the <unk> <unk> around me , almost 60 feet out of the water . and i could just wonder that that was a snowflake in a different snowflake year .
<unk> is born as calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in explicit ways with their surroundings and their experience .
some refuse to give up and fall until the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get it more , and in a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
during a iceberg melt , i put its <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg in the iceberg , he puts <unk> drinking water .
i go to my images of this drawing <unk> as if i was making portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious moments , that they exist in these individual moments , and never come again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of your life cycle .
one part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i put in <unk> in greenland .
very rare you can actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where he &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he sticking about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , went to this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of this .
<unk> is totally paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company called design and animations , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch .
so we decided , tony -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk again with tony .
i just want to go again with him and i asked , &quot; moment , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to higher and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did someone have seen the film &apos; butterfly and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- so your fingers walk along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just just a check of a check , and instead , i did not the slightest idea of how i should <unk> him .
i committed to this place and to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; i &apos;m going to get him a device , and we will find a way that he can make his art again .
because it is a farce that somebody who carries all that in itself , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a conference later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then draw with a <unk> that &apos;s only registered the negative area .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
they say all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the <unk> , after the <unk> , and finally , people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and ate her from all of my wife , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if you can use your eyes to control things , so that <unk> can control a laser , so that he can make a laser that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and forth , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we &apos;ve got the insurance industry out of the doors , and have actually received a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
this was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from the world <unk> -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i went into the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that and that we were <unk> and all the images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks we have programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> them , and now we have a device available to a <unk> , and now we have a device to make it free -- you can build it for free , the software you can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely freely from limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room from somebody else and this is his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew tony for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we have his bed , so he can see out there .
we put a projector up against a wall of the <unk> of the hospital .
and he went back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot .
we also had to <unk> in the parking lot , so we were working as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he took us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve made something drawn .
i feel the feeling i was pushed under water , and finally , somebody bought down and my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t this mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us on the pole and we continue to develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes from a <unk> .
and someone who has such <unk> potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re doing that to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since this time we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it comes all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored , when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it was in april <unk> in the city of los angeles one exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the hardest representative of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just put something around and surrounded me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should each of you , and in every single day where you have something that needs to be done . if not , when not , when not i do , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably america &apos;s most <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you from circles and revelations .
now , a epiphany is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you &apos;re about the block and takes it as a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was launched every week in <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in <unk> .
they did secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to away from the city .
i had a thumb , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found myself to san francisco -- and then in the 1980s , i found it in <unk> .
about three or four years ago i received a call from this teacher , a woman who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to know as adults .
please come to ohio , and please come together with the man that i know that they &apos;ve found him .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and that i want you to be a hurry . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we went to them , and we gave up to her family , because it was necessary because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , to know me , turned it into a box full of ashes and was placed into my hands .
what happened was that the circle closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that takes the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned .
he needs the same thing -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
now , imagine a big explosion , while they &apos;re on to 1,000 feet up .
imagine an airplane full smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear of <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i saw them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had had the machine already , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
this is usually not the route .
he switches off the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror to end .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people that i wanted to raise a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it , i noticed a phrase one , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine we are , and the person &apos;s there , then i open him .
i never want to move more something in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was , when we <unk> the george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to become better in everything i &apos;m <unk> .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego .
and i <unk> the time i wasted things for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t give me two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and in the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of how you know it from a documentary .
while we cut <unk> , i had this feeling , human being , to die .
almost like we would prepare our life for our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness <unk> really in one thought , which is that i just wish me one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
a month after that , i visited a presentation of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
not yet .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world all made sense for me .
i realized at that time , by connecting the dots , that it &apos;s just about a great father to be a great father .
more than everything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i became the miracles to die on this day .
i got another gift , which is to see into the future , and come back and to live and different .
my call to all the ones who fly today is : imagine that happens on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would they change ?
what would they do that they take off , because they think they were forever there ?
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want the bomb to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can now do the systems to <unk> the systems that can control and valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with this centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we create it , an effective <unk> on a laptop <unk> , which is used by a laptop of <unk> , and then we are in the business .
and this is the planning of <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are going to go into the gray box , damage the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> logged .
this is a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we began to <unk> our research at six months ago was completely unknown what makes sense and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the <unk> part of part , the <unk> part , he made by myriad <unk> failures .
and it seemed something <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> our attention and we started a <unk> project where we got our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> as a <unk> who didn &apos;t like to liked our cheese -- <unk> off , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve experimented with different types of cheese , i went on that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that is trying to infect on this goal .
and if not , don &apos;t break out nothing .
so that was really my interest and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we <unk> the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
presumably , they knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you already heard that the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for as first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this cause .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this with the real world -- with potential purposes in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove it .
to get these theories , let &apos;s remind us that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act around a <unk> goal and very likely it is in iran because there are most of the infections .
well , in this area there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
basically , it runs beyond the <unk> nuclear power and on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
now , the rotor is this moving part within centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you rigged the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor of rotor , and eventually , to take the centrifuge explode .
what we also found out is that the goal of the attack actually was slowly to make it slowly and scary -- obviously , to make <unk> despair , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get out of it quickly .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of that by looking at us very precisely data and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> is very clear out of this code ; you cannot miss it .
i started using scientific literature , like these <unk> in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just happen .
these results were achieved by several weeks .
and often we ran into a dead end and had to collect us new .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slower the large <unk> with six <unk> in interaction and manipulating valves .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- got out of my socks .
there is the gray box , and then you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing does is that it makes the fuel values of sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it turns out <unk> code , which is still during the world with the wrong layer of data .
and in fact , this false fuel data has been taken by <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where during the <unk> the <unk> is fed by <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just that <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more valuable .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where one human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the large <unk> will become fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by one human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk is at risk , then really bad things happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither <unk> , even the <unk> will notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about this . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do specifically with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> , how we &apos;ve seen it at <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the consequence we need to ask us .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most sensitive environments .
we have to ask us the consequences and we start preparing better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there was very much about that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem was even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to put me in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat nothing -- fun at beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career today to <unk> situations , and that all are a compelling thing that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what they &apos;re doing for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i took an ad ago an ad on ebay .
i would send a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , received a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson is not going to be a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence to buy what the topic would actually be .
so what you got was this : her name : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be the topic , and they ended up in order to fly the ears for their involvement , especially if i took their company stupid .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this one year , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work in , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve done some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to prepare for something like this , on something like this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from up to the end to the end , from the end to the end , completely with brands , which you &apos;re going to see in the film , this is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
this was more toward the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x <unk> , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the film .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they have ever worn ...
the greatest car that you &apos;re the risk of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , except to show that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring it the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to do if <unk> would help happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has an negative <unk> -- but do you know how to develop this ?
how much money is required to realize this ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case , some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we may see like a tribe of <unk> .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a hard thing about this ?
jk : both .
so ... so not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at the people that they have to do it .
there are some places we can use .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera from &quot; would mean we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant in reality , &quot; we want to do with your film . &quot;
and just how all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought this whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as much people as possible , it &apos;s so many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> that the masses leads to this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
actually no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem at all .
that would be okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you look at transparency at the <unk> <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- unencumbered by deception and <unk> , to discover and <unk> ; it &apos;s understandable to information , especially to understand information , especially the last line , is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be done , changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of <unk> -- like this strange bear , who still <unk> .
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
what else else ?
a whole dish cool <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell you this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father was caught by lying -- and there he &apos;s sitting and watching me , &quot; my son , there are every single story three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s just a company , one agency was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i had to do it alone , i had to do it alone , i had to deal the <unk> and directly with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand becomes understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , giant <unk> , and i have friends who do little <unk> as i do .
and my friends who make big , giant <unk> , say that the reason their movies are so successful , in the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends who make little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see in the film ?
whenever i do myself on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see ban <unk> .
and every time i <unk> someone , i can say , &quot; are they fresh enough for this interview ?
are they as far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they will have choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well for women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you an emergent frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make these things -- you know , people remembers ban -- that &apos;s somehow why we &apos;re interested in .
what would they describe ban ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about audacious , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh is a great word that this category is really to something positive , in contrast , &quot; fight and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them more fresh -- better fresh , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like i , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to be beautiful clothes .
80s <unk> hits <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i &apos;ve got , &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many <unk> and so a stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or one jewelry .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
the brand two : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
part 2 : part hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in the entire country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my small , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be able to be the <unk> , but i often see the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was i needed a expert expert .
i needed somebody who could come into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover this <unk> .
if you could do it for those , they could help me help me .
you brought their images , yes ?
that i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit like this with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the own world is the world , in which you live -- like people who live around the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what connection is this to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do they do ?
what is the <unk> ? what is you now in the moment ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you that are not them .
which other <unk> did you go through ?
this must not be scared . in what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yes . now .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be out of this .
there went a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> are two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
so , there &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on a strength , instead of both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to be afraid to be afraid , and they actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands act like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii mini mini <unk> and <unk> .
now there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would they be ?
they have a <unk> ? are you something that gets blood in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they something that a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are kind of playful , fresh as the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , profane , delicious , magical and agile as <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are it established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> ,
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , <unk> and ways the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and the &quot; no &quot; said because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but will find 17 <unk> who were willing to dispense on these control to try to dispense with someone who wanted to do with someone that we don &apos;t usually have not had to tell stories -- stories that would never support a <unk> .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using <unk> of the brain , both in order to make movies as well as films .
we drove to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city for five years , they have no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we drove in school , in where companies are their way into impoverished schools , in all america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects i got to get the most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and this is what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really be interested in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is to think that our view of the view .
and what was that for you ? what it &apos;s successful ?
now , there &apos;s the film at <unk> film festival , we can look at this .
<unk> was the premiere in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually only a period of two and two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not getting <unk> .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project , which almost any <unk> that we talked about , their customers , to make the fingers of them .
something that i believe is that when you try to try and gather your opportunity , taking risks that in these risks .
i think when you get people from it , then you bring them closer to the failure .
i think that if you train his employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit .
i feel the feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have not fear of ways that they might <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
call the fear . call the risk .
a large spoon have full , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , bringing us a little honesty .
and this said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; is called transparency &quot; from my good friends from <unk> to <unk> on the <unk> for ebay .
big data will be turned for organizations throughout the world .
<unk> : &quot; call transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what happened to the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , displayed on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude , to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , i gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access to their access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t <unk> me -- but i had no access to a lot of art and this works .
and then when i went to visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i was trying to make this desire -- art accessible -- with technology together .
we put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around this museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> that <unk> van gogh .
i actually come into one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of kind of new york .
you &apos;re coming to two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and sorry .
they want to orient up in the museum ?
open the card , and jump it with a click .
in it , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just further . much fun .
look around .
thank you , but the best one comes .
so i &apos;m in front of my <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who really care about art , can click here -- but i click this now .
this is one of the images we captured with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture is about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then they want really deep inside .
and so i started playing around to play , and found something there .
and i thought , &quot; wait time , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit of a little known at the met with some known at the met , and found out that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , where a goose is beaten with a stick .
it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go really close to go , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview of the point , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one comes -- in a second .
let &apos;s go quickly to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
at the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s only when you want to see like van gogh this masterpiece to this masterpiece ?
you <unk> in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my <unk> this picture until i really am in the fractures .
this is <unk> , probably before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it means collections .
each of them , everybody -- right or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and online their own museum -- from all these images , you can get your own collection of collection .
simple , you go in -- and i created this , it means the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put everything with comments to send their friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when they look at this masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they think not even from museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent them online .
this is the biggest question i asked me , &quot; did you make this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split into two camps .
this is the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of any hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this guy would be completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you move your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been at one of these extreme decided , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high <unk> , which is in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or whatnot .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , together with most other experimental <unk> , which need a good share of logic to put together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play with it and look like it , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years , is probably that one thing at the same time can be at a place .
i mean , it can think odd sound about this is that one thing at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember a child playing playing on a <unk> .
he was another toddler and not very good at it and he fell all the time .
but i bet it taught him play with a very valuable lesson , which is the big things not just leave you over , and that they stay on a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with their particles , imagine all sorts of weird things -- how they fly straight through walls , or that they can be at two different places .
and so they all wrote those observations on , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t needed them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and that maybe because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean nobody ever seen a particle .
but my logical side of this didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be so .
so i would make clear <unk> to the whole thing , if we could show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made me a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we look at here is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i zoom in there . we look right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go to all these things , but i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to offend it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just as comfortable .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to be on them and the wind that seems over <unk> and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see this piece of metal , we had to put out the whole <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we made the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> it into a vacuum , and <unk> it to almost just in the elevator , was the piece of metal , like it wanted to behave .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
rather than that it &apos;s just there , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> like this -- like a <unk> and together <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate to vibrate at the same time and not to vibrate -- something which allows just in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what i really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object to vibrate and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms are still sitting there , and at the same time , the same atoms move down and down .
only to precise <unk> , she agrees .
the rest of the time they are <unk> .
that means each atom at the same time is at two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth it for all this year in the clean space , because , check this , the <unk> between one atom and this piece is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if a single atom of a single atom can be at two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t you do it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you would be at the same time in several places , how would that feel like this ?
how would you deal with the conscious mind that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact just <unk> objects that are in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and strange of the mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal , that when families think about where they &apos;re living and work , you want to choose to choose between at least a hand of different cities that all in competition is all in the competition for new people .
in the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city to be available to be called .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more valuable than it costs them .
so we could do the world very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they just trade the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , this already did . the other half yet .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;d like to be about to , in these homes and their environment and their environment , to avoid complaints and from <unk> .
so it turns out as very difficult to keep out of this extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new block , unless the laws there would support such a construction and not <unk> .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new surfaces that have enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , over 75,000 times their country , and they wanted to know what they could do , and they wanted to know what they could do in your country and do exactly the same in honduras .
at this point , <unk> has said to <unk> , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re just going to get a <unk> area of our country , and if we &apos;re just going to work on a <unk> of our country , and when people are going to work there , and can do it all on the surface of these messages , what they normally would usually go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer in 2009 , honduras under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program both did innovation as well as <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to become his <unk> .
meanwhile , i gave me a talk to tedglobal .
by improvement , try and try and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city based on the following elements .
the first point , is the importance of law , laws that determine that you cannot realize existing <unk> .
we give new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws . and they &apos;re usually for laws to help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala <unk> <unk> to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give this the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of an hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are about how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion in a place when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , could we maybe look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk introduced in very simple shape that a <unk> city is a place that is a place that are being out there , which is the laws that rule there and people have to choose either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we have to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and even once on the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve been given another with fact <unk> , which has been a graphic like this has been trying to emphasize that if you want to create much value in a city , it needs to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in <unk> .
that airport alone has a area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of this if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area from least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
well , polite all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the director of congress came on the stage and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but could we maybe look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the statement that a new city offers new options .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also closes new ways for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the aid of <unk> , they could support from their <unk> , who would support the law for this charter and in action that everybody would trust that the charter is really off .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the certainty of the <unk> was going to come here and build this city for all the parties in honduras , in honduras , which has been terrified and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s got a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , at the 19th january of january , they voted on congress to have a <unk> policy that &apos;s for special <unk> <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a heavy crisis behind itself , was elected to a voice for this <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it must be fda approved by congress .
at february 17th , there was been approved to <unk> <unk> to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> of the world that most of them was interested in the business of <unk> .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new slum built in south south south south south south south korea .
all you can see on this picture , was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very much interested in the urbanism is singapore .
there were two cities built in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and you &apos;ve already imagined this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a system that <unk> allows , and it &apos;s also working on an external law .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to put in america , especially at a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world there are 700 million people who claim that they would like to live <unk> on another place .
one million people leaving latin america and wander into the united states .
many of them are dads who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> their work , sometimes they have to earn enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes children are trying to find their parents that they have , in some cases , hasn &apos;t seen anymore .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in honduras to build a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to pass on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new people ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you .
do you know how many decisions they do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions they make in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions , the <unk> of choice is doing a typical american one day is <unk> .
also , recently a study was made with ceos in which she saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the various subjects , and how much time they were working with making decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found out that an average ceo is busy in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these subjects was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were going to be within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions required an hour or more of their time .
think of their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you are in the nine minutes of meeting from an hour category ?
how good , think are they making the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask them when i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very very very very very <unk> convenience stores , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of things of fruit and vegetables and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time we &apos;ve actually drinking <unk> .
i loved it to do this business ; but at one point i &apos;ve asked me , well , how do it come to you ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes , who came from a thousand years .
so i decided to visit the leader leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model that do you really do all these options ? &quot;
and he pointed out to the <unk> of tourists who came every day and usually their cameras .
we decided to build an experiment and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gear .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we &apos;ve made a little <unk> directly at the entrance at the entrance .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes <unk> , or 24 different tastes <unk> , and we &apos;ve got two things , first , i &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would be trying to stay in and <unk> ?
there are more people standing up when it was 24 , about 60 percent than if there were six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people would buy a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who stayed , when it was 24 percent , they had a glass of <unk> .
from the people who were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do it , people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who they had six to choice as if they had 24 to their choices .
now , if you don &apos;t choose a glass ticket , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also affecting us in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even when it comes against our own interests .
so the theme of the day , financial save .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we were looking at decisions about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> , which were a <unk> possible , the probability plan , the probability of being affected by tomorrow .
and we found out that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that , in fact , the participation was lower .
if you &apos;re now looking at the extremes , the plans that offered a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want to do it .
in the plans who offered nearly 60 fund , the <unk> now fell on about the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate in <unk> , even then , even it has negative consequences .
so , the people who participate decided to participate , rather than the more opportunities they were available , the more <unk> they &apos;re <unk> to choose and fund .
the more opportunities you were available , the more they put their whole money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend when you think your future resources is important .
now , in the last decade , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences that provide from more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push on , even if it comes against their own interest .
they meet more inferior decisions -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they tend to decide for things that you &apos;re less content , even if you make an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelving of <unk> , mustard , and <unk> , but we actually couldn &apos;t look at the comparison and comparing something from the amazing offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in different ways -- which they can just use in their business .
the first thing .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that fewer more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry that they lose <unk> .
but in fact , we see it increasingly more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and then there &apos;s an increase in sales , now there &apos;s an increase in sales , it &apos;s reduced to the cost , &amp; amp ; and there is a improvement .
as a <unk> and gamble of the various head and worship the various head of 26 to 15 , she experienced an increase of sales .
when the golden filmmaker corporation her 10 of the worst sold , she was experiencing that the revenues around 87 percent <unk> -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is now <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they provide them quite 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i believe one of the best examples of the market , as you were looking at the best of the choices , something that david <unk> has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff takes automatically in a <unk> part .
those who want to meet a choice , are 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i should be limited .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your staff can &apos;t be <unk> , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to provide all people in this audience to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read , and then i ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that they thought of the first time , when the second time , when the second time , but i would be able to do it in the second time .
because the images had made it real for them .
what makes me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about the reason that people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that must be vivid and concrete .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more than you use a <unk> or a credit card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really be a real money .
and it turns out that if you create it , something feels specific , it feels a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so we have in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with people who have been working with <unk> -- and these people were all in a meeting in which they signed their participation for their <unk> .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting as much as she was , only we &apos;ve added one little extra .
the small thing we &apos;ve got to <unk> was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase of participation around 20 percent , and there was an increase of the number of people who were willing to save or one rise to four percent , which they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
the third technique : <unk> .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study we made in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> and below in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different types of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and put them into 10 categories or <unk> them in 20 categories , then you believe that i have given them more choices and a better <unk> , when i had given them the 400 other than i had given them 600 .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one means &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> and the display on the right , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there are a couple .
if you think that the on the left of jazz is and that , on the right side , then you clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> <unk> .
the categories must say something that provides the choices .
and this problem , often , when you look at the long bullet points of all of this fund .
who would you actually inform this ?
my fourth technique : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can do more information with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> their car completely himself .
they have to create 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order in the decisions .
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> <unk> to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how cares .
when you use the <unk> at the decision , that means that they &apos;ll be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what they find out is that the people who go from the very low <unk> and over again , they &apos;re choosing the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then stay with it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence in that information .
if i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning like i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gears choose to give me nothing about my preferences in the interior , it makes me still choose to choose it .
it &apos;s also <unk> me to the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in this .
let me wrap up .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the <unk> temper -- narrow -- make it real alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today is to manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for themselves , good for the people who they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you are for choice .
and the more we &apos;re more than choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then why this is important .
we all want to be the stars -- celebrities , comedians -- comedians -- when i was young , this was incredibly difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us that we all or all our creative activities can be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but at youtube , more than more than 48 hours per minute .
again , just a tiny fraction of these will ever be <unk> and will look at thousands of times and this is at the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> of this video that he filmed in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video last summer for the first time .
actually didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you just do that as if you &apos;re called five mountain <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually been sent up in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there were jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the demonstrations at the end of the end of the end .
because <unk> , like jimmy <unk> represent us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> on <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
so the chart looked like .
just like the &quot; double raindrop &quot; it seems to be from nothing .
what &apos;s going on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> it went on , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson theater was a first one who did twitter on twitter .
so important is that one person or group of <unk> has taken a standpoint with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then this community was formed of people who shared these big <unk> , and started talking about that .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single single day .
unlike <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of this phenomenon -- either by using it , or do something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold this for crazy , you should know that there was a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats are watching cats who look at this video .
this is important , the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the floor , which made it from a <unk> joke that we all participate in .
today we &apos;re not finding pleasure on something , we do with it .
who could predict all of this ?
who would have predicted &quot; double raindrop &quot; or rebecca black or rebecca ?
what <unk> did her write , in which that kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in a world , in which every minute of two days , is just really unique and unexpected <unk> as that mentioned video .
i admit , i was not very interested in that as a friend i told me to look at this great video , about a guy who went into new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t have disabilities who are not a hard person who &apos;s not going to drive a bloody onstage .
because this is not surprising and humorous , was became a <unk> funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do .
and that all leads us to the big question ...
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and in which the audience is defined by the audience .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- justin bieber made his beginning with youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re also feeling as well as owners of our culture .
and that &apos;s not the characteristics of the old media and they also often meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i go into 10 minutes about the connectedness between three generations , and as the amazing strength of this connectedness , when she had five days , when she had five days in the recycling of this little girl , when she had five days in the chinese sea , and he never disappeared more -- this little girl who is now living in san francisco and today ?
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a puzzle that will even put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who entire life from the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his homeland .
hold it to the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he must admit that his life was a single waste of waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> his .
he moved into silence back .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that history was not trying to <unk> us , we &apos;ve been passed away .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in early <unk> are silent at lake <unk> .
my mother may was 18 , when her father died -- already in a gay marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had asked a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail .
after a four year-olds and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat still on the lake as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear had her front of pirates with rape , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
in a <unk> would have been my sister and i , then i drink myself and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady <unk> of the motor , the clap of each wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came out of the rest of times , but from the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the motor that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the <unk> coast , and at the young man who died up too much for him , and to the taste of the first <unk> , which was one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever tasted like this .
after three months in the refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations , building together a new life .
we let us go down in <unk> , one from the middle of the world , whose population is made out of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smells of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were found between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on one line in a <unk> , six days , double layers , double layers .
we could managed to find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and was put in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to prevent . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but it was painful by &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , and there are <unk> : &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
after where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the motions of our grandmother .
my mother suffered <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake , until their <unk> came to her <unk> .
she opened a <unk> , made a <unk> and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , caught between two worlds .
loan and sponsors .
centers built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student who asked <unk> demands on himself .
in some other , i was in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the insulation .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of this help i was in my last year , i was <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i became from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now tan and social activist who had never heard of lectures , which she had never heard , and in homes , whose existence would never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into a routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were telling each other the stories of their day and two daughters , and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do this .
she reminded me that i was so old as she had climbed the boat .
no one was never a possibility .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , living on the limits of possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i could not be able to buy with a career in law in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to collapse of the collapse of collapse , can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now going to have enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you <unk> it .
opportunities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be greatly encouraged .
there was an energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the <unk> , &quot; not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year long we had no cent .
at the end of one day , i cooking a huge bone soup that we shared us .
we worked down to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant doing that , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure left .
before i give you the talk of my grandmother , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> of the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved them alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother she hit .
without her man &apos;s man , she was worried about a <unk> by court and <unk> in her own case , and one larger <unk> when they won .
&quot; was not known as <unk> .
i &apos;m just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . thousand miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she was coming to hi .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> their stories that we were .
after midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of them is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she was holding it for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t hold them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s actually through women .
you see who we were shaped and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who might come in our lives , we &apos;d come to the <unk> .
the defeat would be too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think on the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease with <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , so brave <unk> of the engine , the <unk> <unk> of the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it might be <unk> , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take with his camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital digital camera at age 15 years .
i combined it with my previous predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the use of the camera was in planning rather .
and when you pick up a picture with a camera , end the process , if you press the outcome .
for me , it seemed more to be more , to go at the right place at the right time .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to keep when the trigger is being pushed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist to it .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can capture , but i &apos;d always want to make it look like it , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about being an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic , but what we think for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and able to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly vaccine imaginable here , which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way of combining each other , you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional looks like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining pictures .
it &apos;s really just about to combine different realities .
so the things that make an image realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that aren &apos;t three special images .
but combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that they should have the same perspective .
secondly , they should have these pictures of the same <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- from the same altitude and the same <unk> .
third is , it &apos;s about going to be able to be able to be able to get the individual images and end by creating it seamlessly .
it makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually made together .
so by putting color , contrast to the edges and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic and disorders , we put the boundaries between the different images and we let them look like a single photograph , even though a single photograph can take hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape of a landscape , and the bottom part .
but this picture is actually completely compiled from different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place when you find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take trade-offs with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to find them to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a <unk> .
the bank comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to let it look like it .
to achieve a <unk> outcome , it runs from me from planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good planned company .
and if you do good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all tools , and the only thing that limited us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced to the <unk> was to make a <unk> .
that &apos;s not particularly scientifically about -- she provides a cup of coffee or tea and asking the patients , families , family , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button , in his own .
and i jump every morning .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 pounds of them .
it works very simple : every time i get on the scale , you send my data on google health .
and there they &apos;re also going from my <unk> <unk> , so he can recognize where my <unk> is , and that &apos;s not just in the moment that i need <unk> or so , but also with a view in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i get on my <unk> and people talk to me , before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch just a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could have patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to bring them to make some kind of game to control their health .
the next week comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> that you &apos;re on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to allow the people to measure their blood pressure , to send him to your doctor and for him to share with them , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t only take control of control of their own ship , but can also help us with the challenge of the challenges that are in front of us , and the <unk> of healthcare , double demand , and so on .
make ways to use the easy to use and start embracing patients in the team .
and that can reach them through these ways , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know very precisely where all atms are around <unk> .
we know one more where all stations lie .
and yeah , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website and an <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and about 10,000 <unk> had been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we have designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone &apos;s going to go , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , her <unk> , to find the next <unk> , to find life .
and from today , we want to be not just as <unk> as the product is called , but also as <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which is about helping us to behave like <unk> to behavior , to crowdsource the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s collapsing , it &apos;s their own familiarity or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing , what we want to ask is that firms on the world is helping us to help us to help us .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in its position .
please help us , and try to make the health not just better , but take into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to force ourselves to touch with environment by ...
it will pay for crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s load .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i &apos;ve launched a program to try to take sabbatical and design in an environment , which is so pretty much everything they actually hate , we have to work them in the government .
the program for america and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> for the geeks .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what today with technology is possible .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what it looks like , as if he was looking for a date , but what he really addiction , when he really addiction , when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> by an feet .
how did he come to look for this particular way of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston in the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has been much more <unk> .
and they found that the city never <unk> these fire <unk> .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , even even something else and that was that the residents <unk> the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what any good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him , if it <unk> <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take away away away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t take any other <unk> .
it is expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so the citizens <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the citizens .
and chicago has just introduced them to <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> <unk> .
we now know nine cities to use that app .
and it has been widely distributed , natural , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team who worked at a project last year in boston for three people .
it was about a way to find out with parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we told us later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would be taken over two years , and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s still nothing .
there &apos;s a project in the california law that the taxpayer has paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that has written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , a kind of shot of the bug on the institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that she represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in the collective technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country who get up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they didn &apos;t complain about them , they fix them .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s then , if you all forget your feelings about politics and the queue of <unk> and all the other things , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please i ask you that you &apos;re doing it because the things change .
politics don &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their strength -- <unk> you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought there was mainly about people to choose to choose .
now after two years , i &apos;ve got to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
there &apos;s where you normally come out when you <unk> in your city .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your <unk> call center , like our fellow <unk> <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that people who call the government for many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and see very loud music and see if the cattle <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the &quot; new urban institution &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what about &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott volunteered from human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all the public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next hand we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here , the digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to get the government into crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them to government performance , if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative services .
if a neighbor comes to the other , we improve our communities .
call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is not the government .
and most people understand that , but you believe that one is the input from the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often we &apos;ve elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re expecting the government that reflects our values and our needs , and then not changed much ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below , is what we call its bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and for which we pay to do something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we have to make its bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is taking place .
we have to be against the machinery of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens , which has written a very detailed <unk> report that &apos;s an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not political , which is <unk> active .
now , for those of us who gave up the government , it is time that we want to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really think we &apos;ve got to reach what we need to achieve , without making an institution that can act in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but that needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to make the function of the government in a way that actually can be able to achieve society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the <unk> internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with it to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t struggle to fight this battle that we all struggle to talk about ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make their minds on every channel to every time , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that the work of the government improves .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this might be to be a fire hydrant , weeds to <unk> , a trash with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have this fire fire all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we are not only consumers , and we don &apos;t only consumers are paying control and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i all have for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in trying to explain the people as wonderful the new technologies , which are going to be the emergence of this , and i thought i &apos;m going to tell you what i really do . and i was trying to see what &apos;s really going on with these incredible <unk> , which will happen so quickly that we can barely keep up .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
if you could just show the slide short .
this is a slide that i just selected out of my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the <unk> shape .
this slide shows data from an analysis from <unk> processor compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide we often find in our field , which we often find in our field , a way on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power in the <unk> .
and this is an novelty thing that we need to use this guy &apos;s scale in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
another bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in the technology on the <unk> ?
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , we say , this is a way of the technology , and this is a random amount of technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would come on on the <unk> scale in the form of a flat line .
but when this happens like this , this changes the <unk> condition .
so if the <unk> <unk> would be as fast as the <unk> progression , then we could get <unk> into a taxi and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
that had never been there before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , through which the scale is growing exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is when you look at this exponential curves , you see they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is forever and forever as fast as we &apos;ve moved .
there are two options .
either it will be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new comes , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think so something like this is going to happen .
it really means that , then that means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask and i also think of myself , is how this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that makes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems really to be very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still at the year 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future is confined to a year since i am in this world .
i think the reason is that we know that anything is underway .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that there is just no sense of trying to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple model of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about what that could be , this transition where we are in the moment .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to step back and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life &apos;s life .
i think that a lot makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of them .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they get the <unk> .
i also think there are theories like everything about rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of that , but i &apos;m going to tell you that at this time , little <unk> of these chemicals contain .
some of these <unk> contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so growing .
all the ones that were , started there .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but these <unk> didn &apos;t be about alive in today , because every single of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have <unk> chemicals down to unequal quantities .
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> grew up , which has got faster than other and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so that tend to survive longer , and they &apos;re catching up in <unk> to the extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is it going to learn when this <unk> is a trick about abstraction .
in any way we don &apos;t really understand , this <unk> is the ability to learn information , information <unk> .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way , they allowed them to <unk> , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over the time of 2.5 billion years where they came in .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every creatures used the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we just have , just to the <unk> , even the thing in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> that i try to keep in airports from <unk> .
in it , in it -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is made out of regular letters -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i made it 10 ^ 22 .
so if somebody would want a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even in the world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
i would be in reality in fact , then i &apos;d written them on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made her happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , very interesting step , in which things were completely different , because they started communicating these cells , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is also why for example the consistency grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how you can stay away from penicillin and have this information together , and now we have a lot of bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria , because the bacteria communicate themselves .
these communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve either survived together , or they went together . that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeatedly repeatedly , and by the evolution of evolution .
the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close to that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many <unk> <unk> , which together as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level of evolution was happening , not longer the individual cell , but the whole <unk> , which we call organism .
the next step happened in this communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structure .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started train specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and making information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning has happened within the period of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn for example , a particular failure , because she liked sick and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now this could be done within the lifetime of one organism , whereas before , hundreds of thousands of years , because of thousands of years , because these information is learned about the individuals who died because these <unk> didn &apos;t exist yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> with this special <unk> because evolution could be within an individual .
she could take place in a time .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
even as example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and give basically <unk> notes in my head , to create a similar idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound around , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we go through the same stages , which <unk> through the <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we &apos;re presenting data , process .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to make this information .
and it connects us to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were there .
so , evolution can happen in the period period of microseconds .
you also have <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the <unk> <unk> again .
the first steps of the story that i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> several hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just to take a few decades .
the process is feeding by itself and will so , i think , <unk> is the word -- if something its <unk> increases .
the more it changes , the faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding by themselves .
i live professionally from building computers and i know that i use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not to use computers without the computer computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it is impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead of doing instead , and what the designers of thinking is , and the machine is doing something that the machine and the machine makes it something far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it makes it partially with ways that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in the last time , is the evolution itself .
we put a <unk> in the machine which is going on in <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed by random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> please have a hundred million randomly selected of instructions .
now please take this randomly chosen instructions , take all the programs out , and pick the people who my policy is next to the next . &quot;
so in other words define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say , i want to take numbers out , that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve been used for this .
so find programs that are most likely to rank numbers out .
of course , the chance of randomly elected elected instructions is very small to just spread numbers by accident , so not the instructions actually do this .
but one of them likes to do with something two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences , which is what my policy has come next .
store that off , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> <unk> that are the numbers in charge .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that are something closer to the targets than others .
say , &quot; please again again . &quot;
<unk> them again .
maybe take some mutations one .
and try this whole one again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , a few hours .
finally , i get programs to make numbers perfectly out .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they are obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m really sure that they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that are going to do the job .
because your life depended on whether they made the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , <unk> a map <unk> and says , &quot; oh check . look . look . look .
there is , &quot; this plane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make your flight safer . don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
so <unk> <unk> us .
we &apos;re using these programs to make a lot faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from today are feeding themselves .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time , as <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make up what the hell we actually are actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after us .
i find it very <unk> from us that we are the product product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of evolution as well .
now , the lunch says , before and i think i hear here now before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , at about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
when we wanted to travel , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the head of dusk without camera and no tweet in my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not killing technology .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full world full world of pirates and <unk> ships in my imagination .
i came up with it as thought of our fancy clocks and cameras from his hands .
they kept us by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to do magic rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it makes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that storytelling always used more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; put your finger on each light . &quot;
and so -- here , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i live -- which is right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about such ways .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
i always found fireflies in a glass .
so you have to flip here the ipad , and the fireflies <unk> .
and the excerpt from the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and therefore every book is here every book and every world is a little <unk> that i prefer here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these cards were static .
this map grows and lighting up and serves for orientation in the rest of the book .
she also shows other places of the book .
i go in here .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that was challenging with new affairs , including the <unk> .
for the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids in their suite is that kids are sitting in their lab , without go down .
but now , with portable technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with your technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll sent to a search . you have to go out and with the passenger &apos;s ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i had pictures of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this <unk> is <unk> . you have to go out to make a photograph from one flower and tag .
in another chapter you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we plan an interaction at which you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality by <unk> , which appear on a plant in a plant .
at a place , the screen filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , they away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology is going to be closer and in the magic and technology in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and the magic , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest , and in places where there &apos;s very much hopelessness .
here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating that is , has given me very much force .
in the short time here , i became clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes to it , it gets important and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a matter , but that the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as <unk> doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had impact .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
she was also the starting of the place in our family in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
it was born to 1880 1880 and the experience of slavery , their view of slavery .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
she put me so stuck . then i could barely breathe .
one or two hours later , when i encountered her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel even my hug ? &quot;
and when i said , &quot; no , &quot; she said me again . if i said , &quot; yes , i would leave me in quiet .
she was something that made you always wanted to be close to you .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins ran around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes . then she came up and came up to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out to outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise that you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to be watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first <unk> me , you &apos;re going to love your mom always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise with promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , granny , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; as well , next <unk> to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought to and said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is &quot; you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s aged a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and took this <unk> beer with my sister and i went to the forest .
we just <unk> there .
then he took a drink of beer and offered to my sister &apos;s one , and she took them , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . don &apos;t you . i want no beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today we do this , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . you just do .
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now <unk> . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still do you because of the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all of all your grandchildren you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to confess to you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity does .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us , they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they were something special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we have to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
1972 , 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are discharged on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i think <unk> our world changed fundamentally .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black black black black black black , in prison , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles , baltimore to 60 percent of the black young men either in prison , in prison , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
but our system will not only be shaped by questions , it becomes also by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treated much better when they are rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , changes the result .
yet , we seem to be quite happy .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few <unk> developments .
my home of alabama pulls them permanently , if you were prosecuted .
here and today in alabama have lost 34 percent of the male black population .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic <unk> is as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world who sentenced children to death in prison .
in this country of our country , there are for children <unk> without genetic growth .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of process .
the only country of the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death sentence is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a man made for him to die for a crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : has someone made for a crime , but : have we made it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people who we executed is one that we have for innocent <unk> , the <unk> and out of death row .
one amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with an airplane , when for nine planes , <unk> , one crashes .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our battle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we &apos;re the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking about my students &apos;s history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the world war war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you tell the people that you &apos;re supposed to stop saying that we have to stop in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and therefore we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions are in the historical context .
we poke each other .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> didn &apos;t get to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany about death .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death sentence .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
it became quite quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , we ever have to kill for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> from us , self-aware and specifically people <unk> . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like it would feel in a world in which the german state of people would <unk> people , especially if they were a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we put people up to death , when the victim is white , when the victim is white , when the victim is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their earth , in their earth , the body is <unk> people in their own .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental footprint .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t engage with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> from suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more commitment , more dedication to be in a complex world .
for me , the time to build , and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged ones that never become at ted .
but think on a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all have to believe things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational , so we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only from our minds .
they come from ideas that are powered by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i think that they &apos;re driving us , not just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians .
when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything . but what we needed most , but what we needed most , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the essence of what i believe is that the <unk> must be engaged for this .
there &apos;s no distinction to find technology and design that allows us to be more human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more from us than if we don &apos;t take us .
she will deeply touch .
as a young lawyer , i had the great privilege to meet pink parks .
always came back back to <unk> , where they were taking two of their earliest friends , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women came together and talked .
and to the wife woman , then he <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks come into the city . we want to talk to us .
want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do if you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i will listen . &quot;
and i went over and listened to just .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
i sat there one day , and after a few hours turned out to me , and after a few hours turned to me , &quot; well <unk> , tell me what &apos;s the same thing about the same .
what do you try to reach ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
<unk> want people to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eradicate <unk> <unk> for children .
we want something against the death sentence .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to eradicate <unk> . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this will be very , very tired . &quot;
then he turned out to me in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to ask ways to ask these challenges : these problems , this sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true for each people on the planet .
when someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also think in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i believe in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , although they &apos;re so dramatic , and so <unk> , we &apos;re not measured in our technology , not about the things we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged treatment , but about how they deal with the poor , the <unk> <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas rush ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted of presence .
i go to the <unk> and visit a clients who might be 13 or 14 years old , and they should be in court .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge someone in something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thought , my kindness , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
exactly , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should take you whatever .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more properly , i started working at a ground .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as a client .
and i started with this . the headline was like , &quot; politics , my poor clients like a privileged , white <unk> , white <unk> <unk> .
in my center , i explained that failure of the <unk> and the police and the police as <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there is just error .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know anymore whether i dreamed of these crazy chicken or he actually had written him .
and to my dismay , i had not just written him , but also sent to the court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to be in trial and this crazy case .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so heavy , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went to the stairs .
when i was the staircase to the court in the court , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are they ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability every single person to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i walked the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have they asked these crazy radio ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
increasingly people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw my favorite janitors and go off .
he always saw again through the window and could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and off .
finally , this older black man who came up with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat down straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the break , a <unk> came in that the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , they don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give it up .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far <unk> , but that it &apos;s the justice of the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our all survive with the survival of their survival .
that we have our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity to connect with humanity , pity and justice .
and most importantly , i want to see those of you who just see this , just say , lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
they have in this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and belongs to them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , which is actually going to be a effort to do something from the <unk> , something else flows into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death penalty for a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> is not with a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> come before .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this <unk> is suggesting that money in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> in america is extremely declining .
this fact is often being asked in a context of elevated <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the classroom of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come in prison .
we have <unk> ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> <unk> that people are going to go behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than you force them to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current impact doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they &apos;ve really brought a string to sync here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
if bin laden &apos;s death leads an increased <unk> .
two : famine in somalia . speaker gave three : spray the police spray .
4 : torturing four : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . speaker speaker : 65 dead .
8 : <unk> . speakers 9 : <unk> <unk> .
various speakers : <unk> . weapons .
recession . gridlock . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are precisely sharing this issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second every second every second , our senses can ever process much more information in than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , is the first stop for all the information of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our system system , our <unk> .
in fact , and <unk> the whole information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it <unk> , &quot; is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , which is seven days , 24 hours on the day , 24 hours on the day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we have in the last century , in the last century , as strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades to create a world of excess .
well , i don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have a big problems -- climate crisis , water , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at doing problems at very long time , but finally , they end up to overcome .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , average expectancy has more than doubled more than doubled that has increased inflation from the population of the population population .
child mortality has to reduce a tenth .
this is coming to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and cost itself to be reduced .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently in a peaceful time of <unk> life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is up to 80 percent in the past 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , water , toilets , toilets , plastic , mobile phones , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth would never have been able to dream like this .
the foundation for a lot of these are technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be on information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and is thousands of thousands of thousands of times as a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it goes -- in good like in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , the faster computers .
it slows down for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left hand on the left side .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that all available .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , something that my friends in autodesk are called sensors in autodesk , synthetic biology and networks , robots , <unk> , vaccine , vaccination and food , digital biology , <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer in &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i &apos;ve got the newspapers <unk> and after the best headlines i could find .
i love these : &quot; watson <unk> of human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence was available to every single owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , four years ago ray kurzweil and i see a new university that &apos;s called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , which is how these used to solve the major challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students , businesses , products and services to create a decade of life from human beings .
think about it that a group of students can affect life from billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that did exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , then i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating <unk> goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource of the force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he was invited the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers was given <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not coming as pure metal .
it becomes connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost for solar energy in india -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy was over 50 percent last year .
last month , this was published with a study , which shows that until the end of this decade of energy in the sunny areas of solar energy , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl sagan was the <unk> 1990 when it was the saturn <unk> , back in the way ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it meant ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we struggle to fight <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , and he gave me the permission to share with them -- he gave me the permission of them -- and by the many of you may have heard . it has been the size of a <unk> in <unk> .
it can produce a thousand liters per day from <unk> water a day -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola this technology is global in <unk> countries on the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to achieve the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
remember that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> than president reagan has been 25 years ago .
and when you look for your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world , the information and communication in abundance , like no one could ever predict .
and it comes even better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries and photograph , libraries of medical diagnostics -- now are literally <unk> and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what we expect .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize .
we demand teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a cell , that you can talk to the device , because it can be with ai , you can test your <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . right in a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of health .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the institutes of disease and prevents a pandemic in their outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest <unk> against a population population is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we grow <unk> from two on five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads that we never heard before , will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of an economic history i see one of the largest economic history of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars to flow in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier , and they &apos;re going to get better through the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get better through the <unk> , and so that they have the opportunity to use 3d and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about one sentence of new , never before .
how would it be about to the oppressed , wherever they are to make a voice to make up and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams can create extraordinary things , things that can create extraordinary things , things that can create big companies and governments only can do in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game that solved the effect .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
as well after its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that nowadays , the human pattern is better as the proteins and the best supercomputer .
and when these people came up and looked at who the best <unk> in the world was not a <unk> , it was no <unk> , a woman , a woman who was working in the day as an assistant at the day , and at night the best <unk> of the world was .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power as individuals to ask us the major challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do that what necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in the store when i can allow it to give a piece of my own wrong <unk> to give it to this .
but before i talk to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> near and move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appeared and turn to statistics and to make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic of that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat tolls .
that means that the player will beat three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball into <unk> , he comes up , he won &apos;t be caught , and who tries to throw up to the first base , hasn &apos;t done in time and the runner was in security .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s certainly hits four from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who met the last <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less than i talked to you about it .
suppose they have a <unk> and they become a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is in terms of <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area and they have a beloved people with <unk> and their <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> whose <unk> is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s beating a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> one should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that none of the medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or a doctor should be .
but what we &apos;re doing is that we included each of them , including the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes any power on the details of how to do this .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was an obsessive <unk> student .
in the high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was too .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters of toronto , the <unk> hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and , and , every branch , every branch of each branch , which is <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i moved with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the school with the impression i knew , if i knew everything known and everything knew , or as much as possible , as far as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it didn &apos;t work for a time until i met a printer .
i &apos;m <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto as a woman , in toronto .
at this point , i visited the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> council was looking for studying the <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i tune to them , he made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under <unk> heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , instead of pumps all the blood flow , turns out a part of the blood vessels in the lung , and that gradually came up , so the <unk> came up .
and this was not a hard way to diagnose .
i asked them and made me to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a time of a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and there i did my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually i made two mistakes .
i sent them home to talk to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the aside and did what i should have had to have a call on my <unk> , so he had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew she was able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to do so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would be able to worry for my patients without worrying about him .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them back home , i sent a quiet voice into me , who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was really missing me so much of the nurse , which i asked the nurse , which was a piece of girl , &quot; believe that it &apos;s fine when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it will go . &quot;
i remember it yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> , and they brought them home .
and i went back to the work .
the rest of the day i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , dungeon the hospital and went to a parking lot to drive home when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was one other nurse said , not the sister who had seen a desktop printer , but one of another three words to me and these three words fear i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the <unk> is very special because we just see the patients so fleeting .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients that they &apos;d expect home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she came home after she had sent her home , she broke them back to the <unk> , she took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure by 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they hardly barely breathe and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them to the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i used to get through this rollercoaster because she came after <unk> , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days became clear that she would never awakening .
she had no <unk> suffered suffered .
her family gathered up .
and over the course of eight or nine days , led to the <unk> .
the <unk> day <unk> you -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you don &apos;t forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this firsthand .
the next weeks , i made me mean , and i learned to the worst shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know all of all the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend &apos;s best , even though this one goes on <unk> , and then you get a terrible discussion when you get the bad discussion , if you get a terrible discussion , and you <unk> that you &apos;re never doing such a mistake .
if you do <unk> and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about , is the ones who make an inside .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve made bad , but that you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my <unk> , he was very loving .
he was talking to the family and i &apos;m sure that he made sound of <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked me these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i do her home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
but slowly put it out .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke together , and i may say i can feel better .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection and never even <unk> a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did it .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot on and i in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and once he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in your office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; remember the patients with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you &apos;ll google this , but it &apos;s not infection of the <unk> , but the top <unk> and causes the top of the <unk> .
and fortunately he died .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of shame and self-doubt , felt open to me and went back to work until it happened and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve got two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only got 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no imperfections in their treatment .
one thought he would have <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys . when that was without <unk> , my colleague in the <unk> of the patient was a <unk> in the lower right and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to him and asked my colleagues as well .
and he did he and when he was a <unk> in the right in the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was fine .
both of the cases in me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , what happened in the first five years , but complete nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , embarrassed .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk about the quiet voice , which is really not happening , how can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- as now , i have no idea what you think about me about me .
when did you have heard the last time from <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , they go to a cocktail party and there you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about the own mistakes .
if i went into a room full of colleagues with colleagues , and to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not reach the end of the second story before it was really embarrassing to you , anybody would get a joke , you would switch the topic and forget the rest of them .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> would have lost the wrong leg , then you believe me , i would have to see him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and those who are not making mistakes and the ones that are not doing with bad results and those with good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response to how antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we do those who make mistakes from medicine , that a safe system remains .
but there are two problems with this .
in my sort of 20 years of medicine and journalism , i have created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and false treatments to my first article that i have for my first article , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; black ways , &quot; writing . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system in a system every day , in which one of 10 <unk> is either one of 10 <unk> or false <unk> , in which <unk> are going to be more more than more more than dead .
in this state , around 24,000 canadians die of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , we &apos;ve got the institute for 100,000 .
both powerful <unk> , because we don &apos;t think of the problem as well as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a <unk> where the medical knowledge has doubled all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and give it a slightly <unk> breath on this and suddenly the story <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same cadence .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all that are errors are inevitable .
so if you take the system as well as i &apos;ve been taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end nobody &apos;s left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , in my show , black species , &quot; i would say the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the microphone .
and then your pupils can expand , they &apos;ve come out in front of the head , then look down and swallow your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to say to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i <unk> . &quot;
what they need is an environment that they put in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the newly defined doctor is a man , white to make his humanity , accepted it , is not proud of doing mistakes , but putting everything out of them , so it can be passed on .
she divides their experiences with others .
she supports other from your mistakes .
and she shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a loving person , so that all of those of them are .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that is , then people make mistakes from time at time .
so that the system is so that the system evolves , which makes people make mistakes that anyone who can be able to create the potential mistake , in fact , in fact , to create the potential mistake , in fact , to make things like me , and that specifically for people like me who should make mistakes and for the rewards of that rewards .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to be able to pass there .
i don &apos;t know what they hold from me , but that &apos;s what i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you think he was <unk> here .
you may think he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
actually he collected fish .
he described one as a very much &quot; common . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until in the 80s , he was placed in great style .
now he &apos;s in the red list today .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or about other places , she &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe them still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to another concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> a lagoon .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t really go from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon from <unk> and from a few mangroves .
there was <unk> from about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen lived well and made good of it in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was shrunk for half its size .
maturity they measure five centimeters .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had too lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story talks about my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the 1960s -- europe has many <unk> .
<unk> meant in countries who started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing ship called <unk> 4 .
i was driving on this and we made controlling the entire southern sea and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the sea .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially the reason of the sea came on , and then then <unk> <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you lead a survey , and then start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals get <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat it away , because they were dead .
once we started a life alive .
she was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them because you could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is accumulated every time of fishers , if you drive into areas , in which never been fish .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our <unk> of the new level and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> .
with the time it changed . it changes because for people are all the actions of course .
every generation looks at the images that they capture at the beginning of their conscious life as the standard and going to derive everything .
then the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they &apos;re going to take the previous losses .
it can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they only get the <unk> remains .
this is now largely our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you could think now that the problem was in people who lived in <unk> societies , killed , and they were known after a few generations , what they did .
because obviously an animal is going to have a lot of times , just even even before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
with time , we focus on the big animals and in the sea , they are the big fish .
they &apos;re fewer rare , because we catch them .
with the time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
now , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm , scientists , that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a previous form of view , aren &apos;t as well as they &apos;d like to argue .
there &apos;s for example , the anecdote is that the report of a <unk> report , who saw large <unk> , who could not be used in this area , or not usually <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in sophisticated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine reserve .
because by marine reserves , we basically put the past again .
we &apos;re looking at the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed and very low .
so , the people who see a marine reserve and that benefit from the insight , which allows it to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap in and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there was a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> will remind you to &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people are so touched -- except from the <unk> , why were she so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little <unk> that has lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , focus on cameron , so he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; <unk> .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , <unk> in communist , you had to put if you had a typewriter to register this in the government .
they also had to register a leaf out of this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could find the creator of this thought .
and we can &apos;t understand in the west , how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be the speech speech .
in our own countries we would never do that .
but if you have to buy a new <unk> from 2011 , and print a side of print , then this page is bright yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern that &apos;s clear to them and their printer <unk> .
that &apos;s happening today .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> from the existing world .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that their money made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online up online , but they &apos;ve done it illegal by putting money from our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , as we &apos;ve collected our <unk> , as we &apos;ve gathered over the keyboard while we &apos;re shopping about an infected computer online .
america intelligence ago , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i claim that there is more likely to be more likely to be a <unk> of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
the second largest <unk> we can see today &apos;s not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it in the money because of them , <unk> as anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases of ourselves , like the <unk> .
it shows a great model of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or was it .
last autumn , it had to register , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system thoroughly .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of this group , whether he had it possible for the <unk> , because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a little bit of such expensive ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate you takes when you put a website with <unk> , for example , gmail .
now we &apos;re all using all of us , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors . but they know that they can use more trust in <unk> states like gmail , because they &apos;re encrypted for the local <unk> , so that the local government can &apos;t be able to <unk> in their conversation .
but if you look into a foreign expert .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
well in egypt , the insurgents in april of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in these records was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes of one in germany , who had sold a few programs to sell a couple of programs that they could intercept -- in very large -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is exactly here .
so western governments <unk> governments with <unk> , so that against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example in germany just a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago of the so-called <unk> , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be your phone <unk> .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their connection .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we continue to think about these things , then the obvious answer of the people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it affects me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments , our governments like , but every right that we &apos;re going to do forever forever .
and do we trust we trust one of every future government , a government that we might have to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to have the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were produced <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : modules , made out of cement with a set of charge , who fit .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the position to build things larger than we , building buildings , a brick after the other .
essentially , the <unk> had become the <unk> block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , the lego came out with it .
it was automatically called <unk> stone .
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , nice bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego did it for all possible .
lego has essentially done the <unk> , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution announced the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was telling us from a world of static , <unk> blocks to a world in which was all interactive .
as the <unk> , allows us to build the transistor much larger , more complex cycles , a brick after the other .
but there is a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept this that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is <unk> and orange .
all you need to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and they can build very quickly .
you add a blue in a green , and you can make light .
you can insert a switch in and so they built a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is here , and they &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
over the simple play , is actually <unk> .
rather than you have to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to use them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed this up to speed or slow , they just turn on this button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> kids distributed to kids and see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as they start to understand the electronics that surrounds them and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a <unk> works , or why the doors of <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod responds to touch .
we also brought them to <unk> .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as material material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought out of risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box and paper -- and they said , &quot; power what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a lobster from squishy that fear in the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material for all .
so <unk> source is open source .
you can go to the website , all <unk> and they make yourself .
we want to do the world of the creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world we live in , that <unk> world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start to invent them .
thank you .
