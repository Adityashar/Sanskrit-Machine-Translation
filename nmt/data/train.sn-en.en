[Eng.1]	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[Eng.2]	The same was in the beginning with God.
[Eng.3]	All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
[Eng.4]	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
[Eng.5]	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
[Eng.6]	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
[Eng.7]	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
[Eng.8]	He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
[Eng.9]	That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
[Eng.10]	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
[Eng.11]	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
[Eng.12]	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
[Eng.13]	Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[Eng.14]	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
[Eng.15]	John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
[Eng.16]	And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
[Eng.17]	For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[Eng.18]	No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
[Eng.19]	And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
[Eng.20]	And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
[Eng.21]	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
[Eng.22]	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
[Eng.23]	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
[Eng.24]	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
[Eng.25]	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
[Eng.26]	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
[Eng.27]	He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
[Eng.28]	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
[Eng.29]	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
[Eng.30]	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
[Eng.31]	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
[Eng.32]	And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
[Eng.33]	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
[Eng.34]	And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
[Eng.35]	Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
[Eng.36]	And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
[Eng.37]	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
[Eng.38]	Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
[Eng.39]	He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
[Eng.40]	One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
[Eng.41]	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
[Eng.42]	And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
[Eng.43]	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
[Eng.44]	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
[Eng.45]	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
[Eng.46]	And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
[Eng.47]	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
[Eng.48]	Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
[Eng.49]	Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
[Eng.50]	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
[Eng.51]	And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
[Eng.1]	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
[Eng.2]	And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
[Eng.3]	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
[Eng.4]	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
[Eng.5]	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
[Eng.6]	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
[Eng.7]	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
[Eng.8]	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
[Eng.9]	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
[Eng.10]	And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
[Eng.11]	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
[Eng.12]	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
[Eng.13]	And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[Eng.14]	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
[Eng.15]	And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
[Eng.16]	And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
[Eng.17]	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
[Eng.18]	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
[Eng.19]	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
[Eng.20]	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
[Eng.21]	But he spake of the temple of his body.
[Eng.22]	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
[Eng.23]	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
[Eng.24]	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
[Eng.25]	And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
[Eng.1]	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
[Eng.2]	The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
[Eng.3]	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[Eng.4]	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
[Eng.5]	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[Eng.6]	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[Eng.7]	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
[Eng.8]	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[Eng.9]	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
[Eng.10]	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
[Eng.11]	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
[Eng.12]	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
[Eng.13]	And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
[Eng.14]	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
[Eng.15]	That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
[Eng.16]	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[Eng.17]	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
[Eng.18]	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[Eng.19]	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
[Eng.20]	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
[Eng.21]	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
[Eng.22]	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
[Eng.23]	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
[Eng.24]	For John was not yet cast into prison.
[Eng.25]	Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
[Eng.26]	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
[Eng.27]	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
[Eng.28]	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
[Eng.29]	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
[Eng.30]	He must increase, but I must decrease.
[Eng.31]	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
[Eng.32]	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
[Eng.33]	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
[Eng.34]	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
[Eng.35]	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
[Eng.36]	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
[Eng.1]	When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
[Eng.2]	(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
[Eng.3]	He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
[Eng.4]	And he must needs go through Samaria.
[Eng.5]	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
[Eng.6]	Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
[Eng.7]	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
[Eng.8]	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
[Eng.9]	Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
[Eng.10]	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
[Eng.11]	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
[Eng.12]	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
[Eng.13]	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
[Eng.14]	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[Eng.15]	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
[Eng.16]	Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
[Eng.17]	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
[Eng.18]	For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
[Eng.19]	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
[Eng.20]	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
[Eng.21]	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
[Eng.22]	Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
[Eng.23]	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[Eng.24]	God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[Eng.25]	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
[Eng.26]	Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
[Eng.27]	And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
[Eng.28]	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
[Eng.29]	Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
[Eng.30]	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
[Eng.31]	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
[Eng.32]	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
[Eng.33]	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
[Eng.34]	Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
[Eng.35]	Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
[Eng.36]	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
[Eng.37]	And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
[Eng.38]	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
[Eng.39]	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
[Eng.40]	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
[Eng.41]	And many more believed because of his own word;
[Eng.42]	And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
[Eng.43]	Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
[Eng.44]	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
[Eng.45]	Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
[Eng.46]	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
[Eng.47]	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
[Eng.48]	Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
[Eng.49]	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
[Eng.50]	Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
[Eng.51]	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
[Eng.52]	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
[Eng.53]	So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
[Eng.54]	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
[Eng.1]	After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[Eng.2]	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
[Eng.3]	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
[Eng.4]	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
[Eng.5]	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
[Eng.6]	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
[Eng.7]	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
[Eng.8]	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
[Eng.9]	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
[Eng.10]	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
[Eng.11]	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
[Eng.12]	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
[Eng.13]	And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
[Eng.14]	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
[Eng.15]	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
[Eng.16]	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
[Eng.17]	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
[Eng.18]	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
[Eng.19]	Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
[Eng.20]	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
[Eng.21]	For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
[Eng.22]	For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
[Eng.23]	That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
[Eng.24]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
[Eng.25]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
[Eng.26]	For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
[Eng.27]	And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
[Eng.28]	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
[Eng.29]	And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
[Eng.30]	I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
[Eng.31]	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
[Eng.32]	There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
[Eng.33]	Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
[Eng.34]	But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
[Eng.35]	He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
[Eng.36]	But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
[Eng.37]	And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
[Eng.38]	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
[Eng.39]	Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
[Eng.40]	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
[Eng.41]	I receive not honour from men.
[Eng.42]	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
[Eng.43]	I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
[Eng.44]	How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?
[Eng.45]	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.
[Eng.46]	For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
[Eng.47]	But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
[Eng.1]	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
[Eng.2]	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
[Eng.3]	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
[Eng.4]	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
[Eng.5]	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
[Eng.6]	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
[Eng.7]	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
[Eng.8]	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,
[Eng.9]	There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
[Eng.10]	And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
[Eng.11]	And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
[Eng.12]	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
[Eng.13]	Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
[Eng.14]	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
[Eng.15]	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
[Eng.16]	And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
[Eng.17]	And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
[Eng.18]	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
[Eng.19]	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
[Eng.20]	But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
[Eng.21]	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
[Eng.22]	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
[Eng.23]	(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
[Eng.24]	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
[Eng.25]	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
[Eng.26]	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
[Eng.27]	Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
[Eng.28]	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
[Eng.29]	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
[Eng.30]	They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
[Eng.31]	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
[Eng.32]	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
[Eng.33]	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
[Eng.34]	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
[Eng.35]	And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
[Eng.36]	But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
[Eng.37]	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
[Eng.38]	For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
[Eng.39]	And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
[Eng.40]	And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
[Eng.41]	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
[Eng.42]	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
[Eng.43]	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
[Eng.44]	No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
[Eng.45]	It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
[Eng.46]	Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.
[Eng.47]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
[Eng.48]	I am that bread of life.
[Eng.49]	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
[Eng.50]	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
[Eng.51]	I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
[Eng.52]	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
[Eng.53]	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
[Eng.54]	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
[Eng.55]	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
[Eng.56]	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
[Eng.57]	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
[Eng.58]	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
[Eng.59]	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
[Eng.60]	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
[Eng.61]	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
[Eng.62]	What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
[Eng.63]	It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.
[Eng.64]	But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
[Eng.65]	And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
[Eng.66]	From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
[Eng.67]	Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
[Eng.68]	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
[Eng.69]	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
[Eng.70]	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
[Eng.71]	He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
[Eng.1]	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
[Eng.2]	Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.
[Eng.3]	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
[Eng.4]	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
[Eng.5]	For neither did his brethren believe in him.
[Eng.6]	Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
[Eng.7]	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
[Eng.8]	Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.
[Eng.9]	When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
[Eng.10]	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
[Eng.11]	Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
[Eng.12]	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
[Eng.13]	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
[Eng.14]	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
[Eng.15]	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
[Eng.16]	Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
[Eng.17]	If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
[Eng.18]	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
[Eng.19]	Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
[Eng.20]	The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
[Eng.21]	Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
[Eng.22]	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
[Eng.23]	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
[Eng.24]	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
[Eng.25]	Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
[Eng.26]	But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
[Eng.27]	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
[Eng.28]	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
[Eng.29]	But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
[Eng.30]	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
[Eng.31]	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
[Eng.32]	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
[Eng.33]	Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
[Eng.34]	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
[Eng.35]	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
[Eng.36]	What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
[Eng.37]	In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
[Eng.38]	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[Eng.39]	(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
[Eng.40]	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
[Eng.41]	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
[Eng.42]	Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
[Eng.43]	So there was a division among the people because of him.
[Eng.44]	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
[Eng.45]	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
[Eng.46]	The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
[Eng.47]	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
[Eng.48]	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
[Eng.49]	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
[Eng.50]	Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
[Eng.51]	Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
[Eng.52]	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
[Eng.53]	And every man went unto his own house.
[Eng.1]	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
[Eng.2]	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
[Eng.3]	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
[Eng.4]	They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
[Eng.5]	Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
[Eng.6]	This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
[Eng.7]	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
[Eng.8]	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
[Eng.9]	And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
[Eng.10]	When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
[Eng.11]	She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
[Eng.12]	Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[Eng.13]	The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
[Eng.14]	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
[Eng.15]	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
[Eng.16]	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
[Eng.17]	It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
[Eng.18]	I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
[Eng.19]	Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
[Eng.20]	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
[Eng.21]	Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
[Eng.22]	Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
[Eng.23]	And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
[Eng.24]	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
[Eng.25]	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
[Eng.26]	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
[Eng.27]	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
[Eng.28]	Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
[Eng.29]	And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
[Eng.30]	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
[Eng.31]	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
[Eng.32]	And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
[Eng.33]	They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
[Eng.34]	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
[Eng.35]	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.
[Eng.36]	If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
[Eng.37]	I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
[Eng.38]	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
[Eng.39]	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
[Eng.40]	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
[Eng.41]	Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
[Eng.42]	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
[Eng.43]	Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
[Eng.44]	Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
[Eng.45]	And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
[Eng.46]	Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
[Eng.47]	He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.
[Eng.48]	Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
[Eng.49]	Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
[Eng.50]	And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
[Eng.51]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
[Eng.52]	Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
[Eng.53]	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
[Eng.54]	Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
[Eng.55]	Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
[Eng.56]	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
[Eng.57]	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
[Eng.58]	Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
[Eng.59]	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
[Eng.1]	And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
[Eng.2]	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
[Eng.3]	Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
[Eng.4]	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
[Eng.5]	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
[Eng.6]	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
[Eng.7]	And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
[Eng.8]	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
[Eng.9]	Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
[Eng.10]	Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
[Eng.11]	He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
[Eng.12]	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
[Eng.13]	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
[Eng.14]	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
[Eng.15]	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
[Eng.16]	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
[Eng.17]	They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
[Eng.18]	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
[Eng.19]	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
[Eng.20]	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
[Eng.21]	But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
[Eng.22]	These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
[Eng.23]	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
[Eng.24]	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
[Eng.25]	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
[Eng.26]	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
[Eng.27]	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
[Eng.28]	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
[Eng.29]	We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
[Eng.30]	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
[Eng.31]	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
[Eng.32]	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
[Eng.33]	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
[Eng.34]	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
[Eng.35]	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
[Eng.36]	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
[Eng.37]	And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
[Eng.38]	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
[Eng.39]	And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
[Eng.40]	And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
[Eng.41]	Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
[Eng.1]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
[Eng.2]	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
[Eng.3]	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
[Eng.4]	And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
[Eng.5]	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
[Eng.6]	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
[Eng.7]	Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
[Eng.8]	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
[Eng.9]	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
[Eng.10]	The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
[Eng.11]	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
[Eng.12]	But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
[Eng.13]	The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
[Eng.14]	I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
[Eng.15]	As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
[Eng.16]	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
[Eng.17]	Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
[Eng.18]	No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
[Eng.19]	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
[Eng.20]	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
[Eng.21]	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
[Eng.22]	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
[Eng.23]	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
[Eng.24]	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
[Eng.25]	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
[Eng.26]	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
[Eng.27]	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
[Eng.28]	And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
[Eng.29]	My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
[Eng.30]	I and my Father are one.
[Eng.31]	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
[Eng.32]	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
[Eng.33]	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
[Eng.34]	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
[Eng.35]	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
[Eng.36]	Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
[Eng.37]	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
[Eng.38]	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
[Eng.39]	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
[Eng.40]	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
[Eng.41]	And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
[Eng.42]	And many believed on him there.
[Eng.1]	Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
[Eng.2]	(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
[Eng.3]	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
[Eng.4]	When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
[Eng.5]	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
[Eng.6]	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
[Eng.7]	Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
[Eng.8]	His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
[Eng.9]	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
[Eng.10]	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
[Eng.11]	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
[Eng.12]	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
[Eng.13]	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
[Eng.14]	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
[Eng.15]	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
[Eng.16]	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
[Eng.17]	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
[Eng.18]	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
[Eng.19]	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
[Eng.20]	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
[Eng.21]	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
[Eng.22]	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
[Eng.23]	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
[Eng.24]	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
[Eng.25]	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
[Eng.26]	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
[Eng.27]	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
[Eng.28]	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
[Eng.29]	As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
[Eng.30]	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
[Eng.31]	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
[Eng.32]	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
[Eng.33]	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.
[Eng.34]	And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
[Eng.35]	Jesus wept.
[Eng.36]	Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
[Eng.37]	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
[Eng.38]	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
[Eng.39]	Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.
[Eng.40]	Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
[Eng.41]	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
[Eng.42]	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
[Eng.43]	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
[Eng.44]	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
[Eng.45]	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
[Eng.46]	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
[Eng.47]	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
[Eng.48]	If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
[Eng.49]	And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
[Eng.50]	Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
[Eng.51]	And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
[Eng.52]	And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
[Eng.53]	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
[Eng.54]	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
[Eng.55]	And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
[Eng.56]	Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
[Eng.57]	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
[Eng.1]	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
[Eng.2]	There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
[Eng.3]	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
[Eng.4]	Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
[Eng.5]	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
[Eng.6]	This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
[Eng.7]	Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
[Eng.8]	For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
[Eng.9]	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
[Eng.10]	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
[Eng.11]	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
[Eng.12]	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
[Eng.13]	Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[Eng.14]	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
[Eng.15]	Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
[Eng.16]	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
[Eng.17]	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
[Eng.18]	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
[Eng.19]	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
[Eng.20]	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
[Eng.21]	The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
[Eng.22]	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
[Eng.23]	And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
[Eng.24]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
[Eng.25]	He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
[Eng.26]	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
[Eng.27]	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
[Eng.28]	Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
[Eng.29]	The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
[Eng.30]	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
[Eng.31]	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[Eng.32]	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
[Eng.33]	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
[Eng.34]	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
[Eng.35]	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
[Eng.36]	While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
[Eng.37]	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
[Eng.38]	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[Eng.39]	Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
[Eng.40]	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
[Eng.41]	These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
[Eng.42]	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
[Eng.43]	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
[Eng.44]	Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
[Eng.45]	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
[Eng.46]	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
[Eng.47]	And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
[Eng.48]	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
[Eng.49]	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
[Eng.50]	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
[Eng.1]	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
[Eng.2]	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
[Eng.3]	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
[Eng.4]	He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
[Eng.5]	After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
[Eng.6]	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
[Eng.7]	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
[Eng.8]	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
[Eng.9]	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
[Eng.10]	Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
[Eng.11]	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
[Eng.12]	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
[Eng.13]	Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
[Eng.14]	If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
[Eng.15]	For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
[Eng.16]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
[Eng.17]	If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
[Eng.18]	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
[Eng.19]	Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.
[Eng.20]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
[Eng.21]	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
[Eng.22]	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
[Eng.23]	Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
[Eng.24]	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
[Eng.25]	He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
[Eng.26]	Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
[Eng.27]	And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
[Eng.28]	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
[Eng.29]	For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
[Eng.30]	He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
[Eng.31]	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
[Eng.32]	If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
[Eng.33]	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
[Eng.34]	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
[Eng.35]	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
[Eng.36]	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
[Eng.37]	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
[Eng.38]	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
[Eng.1]	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[Eng.2]	In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[Eng.3]	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
[Eng.4]	And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
[Eng.5]	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
[Eng.6]	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
[Eng.7]	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
[Eng.8]	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
[Eng.9]	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?
[Eng.10]	Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
[Eng.11]	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
[Eng.12]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
[Eng.13]	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[Eng.14]	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
[Eng.15]	If ye love me, keep my commandments.
[Eng.16]	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
[Eng.17]	Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
[Eng.18]	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
[Eng.19]	Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
[Eng.20]	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
[Eng.21]	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
[Eng.22]	Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
[Eng.23]	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
[Eng.24]	He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
[Eng.25]	These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.
[Eng.26]	But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
[Eng.27]	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
[Eng.28]	Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
[Eng.29]	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
[Eng.30]	Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
[Eng.31]	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
[Eng.1]	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
[Eng.2]	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
[Eng.3]	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
[Eng.4]	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
[Eng.5]	I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
[Eng.6]	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
[Eng.7]	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
[Eng.8]	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
[Eng.9]	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
[Eng.10]	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
[Eng.11]	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.
[Eng.12]	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
[Eng.13]	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
[Eng.14]	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
[Eng.15]	Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
[Eng.16]	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
[Eng.17]	These things I command you, that ye love one another.
[Eng.18]	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.
[Eng.19]	If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
[Eng.20]	Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
[Eng.21]	But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
[Eng.22]	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
[Eng.23]	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
[Eng.24]	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
[Eng.25]	But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
[Eng.26]	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
[Eng.27]	And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
[Eng.1]	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
[Eng.2]	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
[Eng.3]	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
[Eng.4]	But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
[Eng.5]	But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
[Eng.6]	But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
[Eng.7]	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
[Eng.8]	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
[Eng.9]	Of sin, because they believe not on me;
[Eng.10]	Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
[Eng.11]	Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
[Eng.12]	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
[Eng.13]	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
[Eng.14]	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
[Eng.15]	All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
[Eng.16]	A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
[Eng.17]	Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
[Eng.18]	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
[Eng.19]	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
[Eng.20]	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
[Eng.21]	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
[Eng.22]	And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
[Eng.23]	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
[Eng.24]	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
[Eng.25]	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
[Eng.26]	At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
[Eng.27]	For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
[Eng.28]	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
[Eng.29]	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
[Eng.30]	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
[Eng.31]	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
[Eng.32]	Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
[Eng.33]	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
[Eng.1]	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
[Eng.2]	As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[Eng.3]	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
[Eng.4]	I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
[Eng.5]	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
[Eng.6]	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
[Eng.7]	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
[Eng.8]	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
[Eng.9]	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.
[Eng.10]	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
[Eng.11]	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.
[Eng.12]	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
[Eng.13]	And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[Eng.14]	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[Eng.15]	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
[Eng.16]	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[Eng.17]	Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
[Eng.18]	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
[Eng.19]	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
[Eng.20]	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
[Eng.21]	That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
[Eng.22]	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
[Eng.23]	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
[Eng.24]	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
[Eng.25]	O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
[Eng.26]	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
[Eng.1]	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
[Eng.2]	And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
[Eng.3]	Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
[Eng.4]	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
[Eng.5]	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
[Eng.6]	As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
[Eng.7]	Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
[Eng.8]	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
[Eng.9]	That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.
[Eng.10]	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
[Eng.11]	Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
[Eng.12]	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
[Eng.13]	And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
[Eng.14]	Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
[Eng.15]	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
[Eng.16]	But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
[Eng.17]	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
[Eng.18]	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
[Eng.19]	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
[Eng.20]	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
[Eng.21]	Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
[Eng.22]	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
[Eng.23]	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
[Eng.24]	Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
[Eng.25]	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
[Eng.26]	One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
[Eng.27]	Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
[Eng.28]	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
[Eng.29]	Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
[Eng.30]	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
[Eng.31]	Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
[Eng.32]	That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
[Eng.33]	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
[Eng.34]	Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
[Eng.35]	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
[Eng.36]	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
[Eng.37]	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
[Eng.38]	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
[Eng.39]	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
[Eng.40]	Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
[Eng.1]	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
[Eng.2]	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
[Eng.3]	And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
[Eng.4]	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
[Eng.5]	Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!
[Eng.6]	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
[Eng.7]	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
[Eng.8]	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
[Eng.9]	And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
[Eng.10]	Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
[Eng.11]	Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
[Eng.12]	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
[Eng.13]	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
[Eng.14]	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
[Eng.15]	But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
[Eng.16]	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
[Eng.17]	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
[Eng.18]	Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
[Eng.19]	And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
[Eng.20]	This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
[Eng.21]	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
[Eng.22]	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
[Eng.23]	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
[Eng.24]	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
[Eng.25]	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
[Eng.26]	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
[Eng.27]	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
[Eng.28]	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
[Eng.29]	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
[Eng.30]	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
[Eng.31]	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
[Eng.32]	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
[Eng.33]	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
[Eng.34]	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
[Eng.35]	And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
[Eng.36]	For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
[Eng.37]	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
[Eng.38]	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
[Eng.39]	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
[Eng.40]	Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
[Eng.41]	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
[Eng.42]	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
[Eng.1]	The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
[Eng.2]	Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
[Eng.3]	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
[Eng.4]	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
[Eng.5]	And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
[Eng.6]	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
[Eng.7]	And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
[Eng.8]	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
[Eng.9]	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
[Eng.10]	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
[Eng.11]	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
[Eng.12]	And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
[Eng.13]	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.
[Eng.14]	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
[Eng.15]	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
[Eng.16]	Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
[Eng.17]	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
[Eng.18]	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.
[Eng.19]	Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
[Eng.20]	And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.
[Eng.21]	Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
[Eng.22]	And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
[Eng.23]	Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.
[Eng.24]	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
[Eng.25]	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
[Eng.26]	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
[Eng.27]	Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
[Eng.28]	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.
[Eng.29]	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
[Eng.30]	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
[Eng.31]	But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
[Eng.1]	After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
[Eng.2]	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
[Eng.3]	Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
[Eng.4]	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
[Eng.5]	Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.
[Eng.6]	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
[Eng.7]	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
[Eng.8]	And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
[Eng.9]	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
[Eng.10]	Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
[Eng.11]	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
[Eng.12]	Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
[Eng.13]	Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
[Eng.14]	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
[Eng.15]	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
[Eng.16]	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
[Eng.17]	He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
[Eng.18]	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
[Eng.19]	This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
[Eng.20]	Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
[Eng.21]	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
[Eng.22]	Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
[Eng.23]	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
[Eng.24]	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
[Eng.25]	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
[Eng.1]	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[Eng.2]	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
[Eng.3]	And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
[Eng.4]	And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
[Eng.5]	And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
[Eng.6]	And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
[Eng.7]	And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
[Eng.8]	And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
[Eng.9]	And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
[Eng.10]	And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
[Eng.11]	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
[Eng.12]	And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
[Eng.13]	And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
[Eng.14]	And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
[Eng.15]	And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
[Eng.16]	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
[Eng.17]	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
[Eng.18]	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
[Eng.19]	Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
[Eng.20]	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
[Eng.21]	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
[Eng.22]	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
[Eng.23]	Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
[Eng.24]	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
[Eng.25]	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
[Eng.1]	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
[Eng.2]	Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
[Eng.3]	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
[Eng.4]	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
[Eng.5]	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
[Eng.6]	And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
[Eng.7]	Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
[Eng.8]	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
[Eng.9]	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
[Eng.10]	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
[Eng.11]	And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.
[Eng.12]	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
[Eng.13]	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
[Eng.14]	When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
[Eng.15]	And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
[Eng.16]	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
[Eng.17]	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
[Eng.18]	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
[Eng.19]	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
[Eng.20]	Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
[Eng.21]	And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
[Eng.22]	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
[Eng.23]	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
[Eng.1]	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
[Eng.2]	And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[Eng.3]	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
[Eng.4]	And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
[Eng.5]	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
[Eng.6]	And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
[Eng.7]	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
[Eng.8]	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
[Eng.9]	And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
[Eng.10]	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
[Eng.11]	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
[Eng.12]	Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
[Eng.13]	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
[Eng.14]	But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
[Eng.15]	And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
[Eng.16]	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
[Eng.17]	And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
[Eng.1]	Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
[Eng.2]	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
[Eng.3]	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
[Eng.4]	But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
[Eng.5]	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
[Eng.6]	And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
[Eng.7]	Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
[Eng.8]	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
[Eng.9]	And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
[Eng.10]	Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
[Eng.11]	Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
[Eng.12]	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
[Eng.13]	And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
[Eng.14]	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
[Eng.15]	The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
[Eng.16]	The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
[Eng.17]	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[Eng.18]	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
[Eng.19]	And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
[Eng.20]	And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
[Eng.21]	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
[Eng.22]	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
[Eng.23]	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
[Eng.24]	And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
[Eng.25]	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.
[Eng.1]	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
[Eng.2]	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
[Eng.3]	Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.4]	Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
[Eng.5]	Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
[Eng.6]	Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
[Eng.7]	Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
[Eng.8]	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
[Eng.9]	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
[Eng.10]	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.11]	Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
[Eng.12]	Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
[Eng.13]	Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
[Eng.14]	Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
[Eng.15]	Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
[Eng.16]	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.17]	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
[Eng.18]	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
[Eng.19]	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.20]	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.21]	Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
[Eng.22]	But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
[Eng.23]	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
[Eng.24]	Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
[Eng.25]	Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
[Eng.26]	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
[Eng.27]	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
[Eng.28]	But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[Eng.29]	And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
[Eng.30]	And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
[Eng.31]	It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
[Eng.32]	But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
[Eng.33]	Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
[Eng.34]	But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
[Eng.35]	Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
[Eng.36]	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
[Eng.37]	But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
[Eng.38]	Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
[Eng.39]	But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[Eng.40]	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
[Eng.41]	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
[Eng.42]	Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
[Eng.43]	Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
[Eng.44]	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
[Eng.45]	That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
[Eng.46]	For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
[Eng.47]	And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
[Eng.48]	Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
[Eng.1]	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.2]	Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
[Eng.3]	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
[Eng.4]	That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
[Eng.5]	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
[Eng.6]	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
[Eng.7]	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
[Eng.8]	Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
[Eng.9]	After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
[Eng.10]	Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
[Eng.11]	Give us this day our daily bread.
[Eng.12]	And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
[Eng.13]	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
[Eng.14]	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
[Eng.15]	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
[Eng.16]	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
[Eng.17]	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
[Eng.18]	That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
[Eng.19]	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
[Eng.20]	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
[Eng.21]	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[Eng.22]	The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
[Eng.23]	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
[Eng.24]	No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
[Eng.25]	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
[Eng.26]	Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
[Eng.27]	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
[Eng.28]	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
[Eng.29]	And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[Eng.30]	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
[Eng.31]	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
[Eng.32]	(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
[Eng.33]	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
[Eng.34]	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
[Eng.1]	Judge not, that ye be not judged.
[Eng.2]	For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
[Eng.3]	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
[Eng.4]	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
[Eng.5]	Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
[Eng.6]	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
[Eng.7]	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
[Eng.8]	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
[Eng.9]	Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
[Eng.10]	Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
[Eng.11]	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
[Eng.12]	Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
[Eng.13]	Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
[Eng.14]	Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
[Eng.15]	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
[Eng.16]	Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
[Eng.17]	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
[Eng.18]	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
[Eng.19]	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
[Eng.20]	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
[Eng.21]	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.22]	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
[Eng.23]	And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
[Eng.24]	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
[Eng.25]	And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
[Eng.26]	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
[Eng.27]	And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
[Eng.28]	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
[Eng.29]	For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

[Eng.1]	When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
[Eng.2]	And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
[Eng.3]	And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[Eng.4]	And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
[Eng.5]	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
[Eng.6]	And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
[Eng.7]	And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
[Eng.8]	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
[Eng.9]	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
[Eng.10]	When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
[Eng.11]	And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.12]	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.13]	And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
[Eng.14]	And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.
[Eng.15]	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.
[Eng.16]	When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:
[Eng.17]	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.
[Eng.18]	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
[Eng.19]	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
[Eng.20]	And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
[Eng.21]	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
[Eng.22]	But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
[Eng.23]	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
[Eng.24]	And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
[Eng.25]	And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
[Eng.26]	And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
[Eng.27]	But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
[Eng.28]	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
[Eng.29]	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
[Eng.30]	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
[Eng.31]	So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
[Eng.32]	And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
[Eng.33]	And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
[Eng.34]	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.
[Eng.1]	And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
[Eng.2]	And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.
[Eng.3]	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
[Eng.4]	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
[Eng.5]	For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
[Eng.6]	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
[Eng.7]	And he arose, and departed to his house.
[Eng.8]	But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
[Eng.9]	And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
[Eng.10]	And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
[Eng.11]	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
[Eng.12]	But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
[Eng.13]	But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[Eng.14]	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
[Eng.15]	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.
[Eng.16]	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
[Eng.17]	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
[Eng.18]	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
[Eng.19]	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
[Eng.20]	And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
[Eng.21]	For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
[Eng.22]	But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
[Eng.23]	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
[Eng.24]	He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
[Eng.25]	But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
[Eng.26]	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
[Eng.27]	And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.
[Eng.28]	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
[Eng.29]	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
[Eng.30]	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
[Eng.31]	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
[Eng.32]	As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
[Eng.33]	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
[Eng.34]	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
[Eng.35]	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
[Eng.36]	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
[Eng.37]	Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
[Eng.38]	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
[Eng.1]	And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
[Eng.2]	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
[Eng.3]	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
[Eng.4]	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
[Eng.5]	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
[Eng.6]	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[Eng.7]	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[Eng.8]	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
[Eng.9]	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
[Eng.10]	Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
[Eng.11]	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
[Eng.12]	And when ye come into an house, salute it.
[Eng.13]	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
[Eng.14]	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
[Eng.15]	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
[Eng.16]	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
[Eng.17]	But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
[Eng.18]	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
[Eng.19]	But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
[Eng.20]	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
[Eng.21]	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
[Eng.22]	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
[Eng.23]	But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
[Eng.24]	The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
[Eng.25]	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?
[Eng.26]	Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
[Eng.27]	What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
[Eng.28]	And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
[Eng.29]	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
[Eng.30]	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[Eng.31]	Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
[Eng.32]	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.33]	But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.34]	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
[Eng.35]	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
[Eng.36]	And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
[Eng.37]	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[Eng.38]	And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
[Eng.39]	He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
[Eng.40]	He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
[Eng.41]	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
[Eng.42]	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
[Eng.1]	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
[Eng.2]	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
[Eng.3]	And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
[Eng.4]	Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
[Eng.5]	The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
[Eng.6]	And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
[Eng.7]	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
[Eng.8]	But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
[Eng.9]	But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
[Eng.10]	For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
[Eng.11]	Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
[Eng.12]	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
[Eng.13]	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
[Eng.14]	And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
[Eng.15]	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.16]	But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
[Eng.17]	And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
[Eng.18]	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
[Eng.19]	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
[Eng.20]	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
[Eng.21]	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
[Eng.22]	But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
[Eng.23]	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
[Eng.24]	But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
[Eng.25]	At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
[Eng.26]	Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
[Eng.27]	All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
[Eng.28]	Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[Eng.29]	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
[Eng.30]	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[Eng.1]	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.
[Eng.2]	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
[Eng.3]	But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
[Eng.4]	How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
[Eng.5]	Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
[Eng.6]	But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
[Eng.7]	But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
[Eng.8]	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
[Eng.9]	And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
[Eng.10]	And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
[Eng.11]	And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
[Eng.12]	How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
[Eng.13]	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
[Eng.14]	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
[Eng.15]	But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
[Eng.16]	And charged them that they should not make him known:
[Eng.17]	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
[Eng.18]	Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
[Eng.19]	He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
[Eng.20]	A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
[Eng.21]	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
[Eng.22]	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
[Eng.23]	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
[Eng.24]	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
[Eng.25]	And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
[Eng.26]	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
[Eng.27]	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
[Eng.28]	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
[Eng.29]	Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
[Eng.30]	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
[Eng.31]	Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
[Eng.32]	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
[Eng.33]	Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
[Eng.34]	O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
[Eng.35]	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
[Eng.36]	But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
[Eng.37]	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
[Eng.38]	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
[Eng.39]	But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
[Eng.40]	For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
[Eng.41]	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
[Eng.42]	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
[Eng.43]	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
[Eng.44]	Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
[Eng.45]	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
[Eng.46]	While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
[Eng.47]	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
[Eng.48]	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
[Eng.49]	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
[Eng.50]	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
[Eng.1]	The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
[Eng.2]	And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
[Eng.3]	And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
[Eng.4]	And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
[Eng.5]	Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
[Eng.6]	And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
[Eng.7]	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
[Eng.8]	But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
[Eng.9]	Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.10]	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
[Eng.11]	He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
[Eng.12]	For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
[Eng.13]	Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
[Eng.14]	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
[Eng.15]	For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
[Eng.16]	But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
[Eng.17]	For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
[Eng.18]	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
[Eng.19]	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
[Eng.20]	But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
[Eng.21]	Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
[Eng.22]	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
[Eng.23]	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
[Eng.24]	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
[Eng.25]	But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
[Eng.26]	But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
[Eng.27]	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
[Eng.28]	He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
[Eng.29]	But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
[Eng.30]	Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
[Eng.31]	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
[Eng.32]	Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
[Eng.33]	Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
[Eng.34]	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
[Eng.35]	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
[Eng.36]	Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
[Eng.37]	He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
[Eng.38]	The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
[Eng.39]	The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
[Eng.40]	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
[Eng.41]	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
[Eng.42]	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.43]	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.44]	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
[Eng.45]	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
[Eng.46]	Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
[Eng.47]	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
[Eng.48]	Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
[Eng.49]	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
[Eng.50]	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.51]	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
[Eng.52]	Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
[Eng.53]	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
[Eng.54]	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
[Eng.55]	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
[Eng.56]	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
[Eng.57]	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
[Eng.58]	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
[Eng.1]	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
[Eng.2]	And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
[Eng.3]	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
[Eng.4]	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
[Eng.5]	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
[Eng.6]	But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
[Eng.7]	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
[Eng.8]	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
[Eng.9]	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
[Eng.10]	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
[Eng.11]	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
[Eng.12]	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
[Eng.13]	When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
[Eng.14]	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
[Eng.15]	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
[Eng.16]	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
[Eng.17]	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
[Eng.18]	He said, Bring them hither to me.
[Eng.19]	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
[Eng.20]	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
[Eng.21]	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
[Eng.22]	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
[Eng.23]	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
[Eng.24]	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
[Eng.25]	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
[Eng.26]	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
[Eng.27]	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
[Eng.28]	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
[Eng.29]	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
[Eng.30]	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
[Eng.31]	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
[Eng.32]	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
[Eng.33]	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
[Eng.34]	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
[Eng.35]	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
[Eng.36]	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
[Eng.1]	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
[Eng.2]	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
[Eng.3]	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
[Eng.4]	For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
[Eng.5]	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
[Eng.6]	And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
[Eng.7]	Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
[Eng.8]	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
[Eng.9]	But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
[Eng.10]	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
[Eng.11]	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
[Eng.12]	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
[Eng.13]	But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
[Eng.14]	Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
[Eng.15]	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
[Eng.16]	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
[Eng.17]	Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
[Eng.18]	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
[Eng.19]	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
[Eng.20]	These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
[Eng.21]	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
[Eng.22]	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
[Eng.23]	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
[Eng.24]	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[Eng.25]	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
[Eng.26]	But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
[Eng.27]	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
[Eng.28]	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
[Eng.29]	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
[Eng.30]	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
[Eng.31]	Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
[Eng.32]	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
[Eng.33]	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
[Eng.34]	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
[Eng.35]	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
[Eng.36]	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
[Eng.37]	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
[Eng.38]	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
[Eng.39]	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
[Eng.1]	The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
[Eng.2]	He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
[Eng.3]	And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
[Eng.4]	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
[Eng.5]	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
[Eng.6]	Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
[Eng.7]	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
[Eng.8]	Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
[Eng.9]	Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
[Eng.10]	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
[Eng.11]	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
[Eng.12]	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
[Eng.13]	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
[Eng.14]	And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
[Eng.15]	He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
[Eng.16]	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[Eng.17]	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.18]	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
[Eng.19]	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[Eng.20]	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
[Eng.21]	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
[Eng.22]	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
[Eng.23]	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
[Eng.24]	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
[Eng.25]	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
[Eng.26]	For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[Eng.27]	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
[Eng.28]	Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
[Eng.1]	And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
[Eng.2]	And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
[Eng.3]	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
[Eng.4]	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
[Eng.5]	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
[Eng.6]	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
[Eng.7]	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
[Eng.8]	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
[Eng.9]	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
[Eng.10]	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
[Eng.11]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
[Eng.12]	But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
[Eng.13]	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
[Eng.14]	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
[Eng.15]	Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
[Eng.16]	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
[Eng.17]	Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
[Eng.18]	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
[Eng.19]	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
[Eng.20]	And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
[Eng.21]	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
[Eng.22]	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
[Eng.23]	And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
[Eng.24]	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
[Eng.25]	He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
[Eng.26]	Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.
[Eng.27]	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
[Eng.1]	At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
[Eng.2]	And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
[Eng.3]	And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.4]	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.5]	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
[Eng.6]	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
[Eng.7]	Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
[Eng.8]	Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
[Eng.9]	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
[Eng.10]	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.11]	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
[Eng.12]	How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
[Eng.13]	And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
[Eng.14]	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
[Eng.15]	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
[Eng.16]	But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
[Eng.17]	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
[Eng.18]	Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[Eng.19]	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
[Eng.20]	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
[Eng.21]	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
[Eng.22]	Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
[Eng.23]	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
[Eng.24]	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
[Eng.25]	But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
[Eng.26]	The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
[Eng.27]	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
[Eng.28]	But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
[Eng.29]	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
[Eng.30]	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
[Eng.31]	So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
[Eng.32]	Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
[Eng.33]	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
[Eng.34]	And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
[Eng.35]	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
[Eng.1]	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
[Eng.2]	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
[Eng.3]	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
[Eng.4]	And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
[Eng.5]	And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
[Eng.6]	Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
[Eng.7]	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
[Eng.8]	He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
[Eng.9]	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
[Eng.10]	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
[Eng.11]	But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.
[Eng.12]	For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
[Eng.13]	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
[Eng.14]	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.15]	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
[Eng.16]	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
[Eng.17]	And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
[Eng.18]	He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
[Eng.19]	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
[Eng.20]	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
[Eng.21]	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
[Eng.22]	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
[Eng.23]	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[Eng.24]	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[Eng.25]	When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
[Eng.26]	But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
[Eng.27]	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
[Eng.28]	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
[Eng.29]	And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
[Eng.30]	But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
[Eng.1]	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
[Eng.2]	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
[Eng.3]	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
[Eng.4]	And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
[Eng.5]	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
[Eng.6]	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
[Eng.7]	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
[Eng.8]	So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
[Eng.9]	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
[Eng.10]	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
[Eng.11]	And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
[Eng.12]	Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
[Eng.13]	But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
[Eng.14]	Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
[Eng.15]	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
[Eng.16]	So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
[Eng.17]	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
[Eng.18]	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
[Eng.19]	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.
[Eng.20]	Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
[Eng.21]	And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
[Eng.22]	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
[Eng.23]	And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
[Eng.24]	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
[Eng.25]	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
[Eng.26]	But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
[Eng.27]	And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
[Eng.28]	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
[Eng.29]	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
[Eng.30]	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
[Eng.31]	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.
[Eng.32]	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
[Eng.33]	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
[Eng.34]	So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
[Eng.1]	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
[Eng.2]	Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
[Eng.3]	And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
[Eng.4]	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
[Eng.5]	Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
[Eng.6]	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
[Eng.7]	And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
[Eng.8]	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
[Eng.9]	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
[Eng.10]	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
[Eng.11]	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
[Eng.12]	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
[Eng.13]	And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
[Eng.14]	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
[Eng.15]	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
[Eng.16]	And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
[Eng.17]	And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
[Eng.18]	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
[Eng.19]	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
[Eng.20]	And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
[Eng.21]	Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
[Eng.22]	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
[Eng.23]	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
[Eng.24]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
[Eng.25]	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
[Eng.26]	But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
[Eng.27]	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
[Eng.28]	But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
[Eng.29]	He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
[Eng.30]	And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
[Eng.31]	Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
[Eng.32]	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
[Eng.33]	Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
[Eng.34]	And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
[Eng.35]	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
[Eng.36]	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
[Eng.37]	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
[Eng.38]	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
[Eng.39]	And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
[Eng.40]	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
[Eng.41]	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
[Eng.42]	Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
[Eng.43]	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
[Eng.44]	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
[Eng.45]	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
[Eng.46]	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
[Eng.1]	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
[Eng.2]	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
[Eng.3]	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
[Eng.4]	Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
[Eng.5]	But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
[Eng.6]	And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
[Eng.7]	But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
[Eng.8]	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
[Eng.9]	Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
[Eng.10]	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
[Eng.11]	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
[Eng.12]	And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
[Eng.13]	Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.14]	For many are called, but few are chosen.
[Eng.15]	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
[Eng.16]	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
[Eng.17]	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
[Eng.18]	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
[Eng.19]	Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
[Eng.20]	And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
[Eng.21]	They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
[Eng.22]	When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
[Eng.23]	The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
[Eng.24]	Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
[Eng.25]	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
[Eng.26]	Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
[Eng.27]	And last of all the woman died also.
[Eng.28]	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
[Eng.29]	Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
[Eng.30]	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
[Eng.31]	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
[Eng.32]	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
[Eng.33]	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
[Eng.34]	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
[Eng.35]	Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
[Eng.36]	Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
[Eng.37]	Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
[Eng.38]	This is the first and great commandment.
[Eng.39]	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
[Eng.40]	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
[Eng.41]	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
[Eng.42]	Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.
[Eng.43]	He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
[Eng.44]	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
[Eng.45]	If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
[Eng.46]	And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
[Eng.1]	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
[Eng.2]	Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
[Eng.3]	All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
[Eng.4]	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
[Eng.5]	But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
[Eng.6]	And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
[Eng.7]	And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
[Eng.8]	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.
[Eng.9]	And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
[Eng.10]	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
[Eng.11]	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
[Eng.12]	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
[Eng.13]	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
[Eng.14]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
[Eng.15]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
[Eng.16]	Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
[Eng.17]	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
[Eng.18]	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
[Eng.19]	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
[Eng.20]	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
[Eng.21]	And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
[Eng.22]	And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
[Eng.23]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
[Eng.24]	Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
[Eng.25]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
[Eng.26]	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
[Eng.27]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
[Eng.28]	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
[Eng.29]	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
[Eng.30]	And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
[Eng.31]	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
[Eng.32]	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
[Eng.33]	Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
[Eng.34]	Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:
[Eng.35]	That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
[Eng.36]	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
[Eng.37]	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
[Eng.38]	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
[Eng.39]	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[Eng.1]	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
[Eng.2]	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
[Eng.3]	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
[Eng.4]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
[Eng.5]	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
[Eng.6]	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[Eng.7]	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
[Eng.8]	All these are the beginning of sorrows.
[Eng.9]	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[Eng.10]	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[Eng.11]	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
[Eng.12]	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
[Eng.13]	But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
[Eng.14]	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
[Eng.15]	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
[Eng.16]	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
[Eng.17]	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
[Eng.18]	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
[Eng.19]	And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
[Eng.20]	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
[Eng.21]	For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
[Eng.22]	And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
[Eng.23]	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.
[Eng.24]	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
[Eng.25]	Behold, I have told you before.
[Eng.26]	Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.
[Eng.27]	For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
[Eng.28]	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
[Eng.29]	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
[Eng.30]	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[Eng.31]	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
[Eng.32]	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
[Eng.33]	So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
[Eng.34]	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
[Eng.35]	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
[Eng.36]	But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
[Eng.37]	But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
[Eng.38]	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
[Eng.39]	And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
[Eng.40]	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
[Eng.41]	Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
[Eng.42]	Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
[Eng.43]	But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
[Eng.44]	Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
[Eng.45]	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
[Eng.46]	Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
[Eng.47]	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
[Eng.48]	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
[Eng.49]	And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
[Eng.50]	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
[Eng.51]	And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.1]	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
[Eng.2]	And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
[Eng.3]	They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
[Eng.4]	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
[Eng.5]	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
[Eng.6]	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
[Eng.7]	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
[Eng.8]	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
[Eng.9]	But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
[Eng.10]	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
[Eng.11]	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
[Eng.12]	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
[Eng.13]	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
[Eng.14]	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
[Eng.15]	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
[Eng.16]	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
[Eng.17]	And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
[Eng.18]	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
[Eng.19]	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
[Eng.20]	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
[Eng.21]	His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
[Eng.22]	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
[Eng.23]	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
[Eng.24]	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
[Eng.25]	And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
[Eng.26]	His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
[Eng.27]	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
[Eng.28]	Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
[Eng.29]	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
[Eng.30]	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[Eng.31]	When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
[Eng.32]	And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
[Eng.33]	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
[Eng.34]	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
[Eng.35]	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
[Eng.36]	Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
[Eng.37]	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
[Eng.38]	When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
[Eng.39]	Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
[Eng.40]	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
[Eng.41]	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
[Eng.42]	For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
[Eng.43]	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
[Eng.44]	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
[Eng.45]	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
[Eng.46]	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
[Eng.1]	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
[Eng.2]	Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
[Eng.3]	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
[Eng.4]	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
[Eng.5]	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
[Eng.6]	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
[Eng.7]	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
[Eng.8]	But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
[Eng.9]	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
[Eng.10]	When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
[Eng.11]	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
[Eng.12]	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
[Eng.13]	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
[Eng.14]	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
[Eng.15]	And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
[Eng.16]	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
[Eng.17]	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
[Eng.18]	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
[Eng.19]	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
[Eng.20]	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
[Eng.21]	And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
[Eng.22]	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
[Eng.23]	And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
[Eng.24]	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
[Eng.25]	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
[Eng.26]	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
[Eng.27]	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
[Eng.28]	For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
[Eng.29]	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
[Eng.30]	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
[Eng.31]	Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
[Eng.32]	But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
[Eng.33]	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
[Eng.34]	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
[Eng.35]	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
[Eng.36]	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
[Eng.37]	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
[Eng.38]	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
[Eng.39]	And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
[Eng.40]	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
[Eng.41]	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
[Eng.42]	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
[Eng.43]	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
[Eng.44]	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
[Eng.45]	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[Eng.46]	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
[Eng.47]	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
[Eng.48]	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
[Eng.49]	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
[Eng.50]	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
[Eng.51]	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
[Eng.52]	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
[Eng.53]	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
[Eng.54]	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
[Eng.55]	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
[Eng.56]	But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
[Eng.57]	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
[Eng.58]	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
[Eng.59]	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
[Eng.60]	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
[Eng.61]	And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
[Eng.62]	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
[Eng.63]	But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
[Eng.64]	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
[Eng.65]	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
[Eng.66]	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
[Eng.67]	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
[Eng.68]	Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
[Eng.69]	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
[Eng.70]	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
[Eng.71]	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
[Eng.72]	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
[Eng.73]	And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
[Eng.74]	Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
[Eng.75]	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
[Eng.1]	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
[Eng.2]	And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
[Eng.3]	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
[Eng.4]	Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
[Eng.5]	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
[Eng.6]	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
[Eng.7]	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
[Eng.8]	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
[Eng.9]	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
[Eng.10]	And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
[Eng.11]	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
[Eng.12]	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
[Eng.13]	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
[Eng.14]	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
[Eng.15]	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
[Eng.16]	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
[Eng.17]	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
[Eng.18]	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
[Eng.19]	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
[Eng.20]	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
[Eng.21]	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
[Eng.22]	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
[Eng.23]	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
[Eng.24]	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
[Eng.25]	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
[Eng.26]	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
[Eng.27]	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.
[Eng.28]	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
[Eng.29]	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
[Eng.30]	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
[Eng.31]	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
[Eng.32]	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
[Eng.33]	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
[Eng.34]	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.
[Eng.35]	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
[Eng.36]	And sitting down they watched him there;
[Eng.37]	And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
[Eng.38]	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
[Eng.39]	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
[Eng.40]	And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
[Eng.41]	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
[Eng.42]	He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
[Eng.43]	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
[Eng.44]	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
[Eng.45]	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
[Eng.46]	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[Eng.47]	Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
[Eng.48]	And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
[Eng.49]	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
[Eng.50]	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
[Eng.51]	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
[Eng.52]	And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
[Eng.53]	And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
[Eng.54]	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
[Eng.55]	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
[Eng.56]	Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.
[Eng.57]	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
[Eng.58]	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
[Eng.59]	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
[Eng.60]	And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
[Eng.61]	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
[Eng.62]	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
[Eng.63]	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
[Eng.64]	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
[Eng.65]	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
[Eng.66]	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
[Eng.1]	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
[Eng.2]	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
[Eng.3]	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
[Eng.4]	And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
[Eng.5]	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
[Eng.6]	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
[Eng.7]	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
[Eng.8]	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
[Eng.9]	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
[Eng.10]	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
[Eng.11]	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
[Eng.12]	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
[Eng.13]	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
[Eng.14]	And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
[Eng.15]	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
[Eng.16]	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
[Eng.17]	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
[Eng.18]	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[Eng.19]	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
[Eng.20]	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
[Eng.1]	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
[Eng.2]	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
[Eng.3]	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
[Eng.4]	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[Eng.5]	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
[Eng.6]	And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
[Eng.7]	And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
[Eng.8]	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[Eng.9]	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
[Eng.10]	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
[Eng.11]	And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
[Eng.12]	And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
[Eng.13]	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
[Eng.14]	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
[Eng.15]	And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
[Eng.16]	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
[Eng.17]	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
[Eng.18]	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
[Eng.19]	And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
[Eng.20]	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
[Eng.21]	And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
[Eng.22]	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
[Eng.23]	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
[Eng.24]	Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
[Eng.25]	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
[Eng.26]	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
[Eng.27]	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
[Eng.28]	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
[Eng.29]	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
[Eng.30]	But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
[Eng.31]	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
[Eng.32]	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
[Eng.33]	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
[Eng.34]	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
[Eng.35]	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
[Eng.36]	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
[Eng.37]	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.
[Eng.38]	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
[Eng.39]	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
[Eng.40]	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
[Eng.41]	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
[Eng.42]	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
[Eng.43]	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
[Eng.44]	And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
[Eng.45]	But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
[Eng.1]	And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
[Eng.2]	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
[Eng.3]	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
[Eng.4]	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
[Eng.5]	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
[Eng.6]	But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
[Eng.7]	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
[Eng.8]	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
[Eng.9]	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
[Eng.10]	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
[Eng.11]	I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
[Eng.12]	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
[Eng.13]	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
[Eng.14]	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
[Eng.15]	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
[Eng.16]	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
[Eng.17]	When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[Eng.18]	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
[Eng.19]	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
[Eng.20]	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
[Eng.21]	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
[Eng.22]	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
[Eng.23]	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
[Eng.24]	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
[Eng.25]	And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
[Eng.26]	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
[Eng.27]	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
[Eng.28]	Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
[Eng.1]	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
[Eng.2]	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
[Eng.3]	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
[Eng.4]	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
[Eng.5]	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
[Eng.6]	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
[Eng.7]	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
[Eng.8]	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
[Eng.9]	And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
[Eng.10]	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
[Eng.11]	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
[Eng.12]	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
[Eng.13]	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.
[Eng.14]	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
[Eng.15]	And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
[Eng.16]	And Simon he surnamed Peter;
[Eng.17]	And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
[Eng.18]	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
[Eng.19]	And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
[Eng.20]	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
[Eng.21]	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
[Eng.22]	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
[Eng.23]	And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
[Eng.24]	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
[Eng.25]	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
[Eng.26]	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
[Eng.27]	No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
[Eng.28]	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
[Eng.29]	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.
[Eng.30]	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
[Eng.31]	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
[Eng.32]	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
[Eng.33]	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
[Eng.34]	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
[Eng.35]	For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
[Eng.1]	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
[Eng.2]	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
[Eng.3]	Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
[Eng.4]	And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
[Eng.5]	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
[Eng.6]	But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
[Eng.7]	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
[Eng.8]	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
[Eng.9]	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.10]	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
[Eng.11]	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
[Eng.12]	That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
[Eng.13]	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
[Eng.14]	The sower soweth the word.
[Eng.15]	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
[Eng.16]	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
[Eng.17]	And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
[Eng.18]	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
[Eng.19]	And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
[Eng.20]	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
[Eng.21]	And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
[Eng.22]	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
[Eng.23]	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.24]	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
[Eng.25]	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
[Eng.26]	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
[Eng.27]	And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
[Eng.28]	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
[Eng.29]	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
[Eng.30]	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
[Eng.31]	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
[Eng.32]	But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
[Eng.33]	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.
[Eng.34]	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
[Eng.35]	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
[Eng.36]	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
[Eng.37]	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
[Eng.38]	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
[Eng.39]	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
[Eng.40]	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
[Eng.41]	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
[Eng.1]	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
[Eng.2]	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
[Eng.3]	Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
[Eng.4]	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
[Eng.5]	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
[Eng.6]	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
[Eng.7]	And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
[Eng.8]	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
[Eng.9]	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
[Eng.10]	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
[Eng.11]	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
[Eng.12]	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
[Eng.13]	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
[Eng.14]	And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
[Eng.15]	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
[Eng.16]	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
[Eng.17]	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
[Eng.18]	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
[Eng.19]	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
[Eng.20]	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
[Eng.21]	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
[Eng.22]	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
[Eng.23]	And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
[Eng.24]	And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
[Eng.25]	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
[Eng.26]	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
[Eng.27]	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
[Eng.28]	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
[Eng.29]	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
[Eng.30]	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
[Eng.31]	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
[Eng.32]	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
[Eng.33]	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
[Eng.34]	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
[Eng.35]	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
[Eng.36]	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
[Eng.37]	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
[Eng.38]	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
[Eng.39]	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
[Eng.40]	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
[Eng.41]	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
[Eng.42]	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
[Eng.43]	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
[Eng.1]	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
[Eng.2]	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
[Eng.3]	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
[Eng.4]	But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
[Eng.5]	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
[Eng.6]	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
[Eng.7]	And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
[Eng.8]	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
[Eng.9]	But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
[Eng.10]	And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
[Eng.11]	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
[Eng.12]	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
[Eng.13]	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
[Eng.14]	And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
[Eng.15]	Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
[Eng.16]	But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
[Eng.17]	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
[Eng.18]	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
[Eng.19]	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
[Eng.20]	For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
[Eng.21]	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
[Eng.22]	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
[Eng.23]	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
[Eng.24]	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
[Eng.25]	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
[Eng.26]	And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
[Eng.27]	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
[Eng.28]	And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
[Eng.29]	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
[Eng.30]	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
[Eng.31]	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
[Eng.32]	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
[Eng.33]	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
[Eng.34]	And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
[Eng.35]	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
[Eng.36]	Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
[Eng.37]	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
[Eng.38]	He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
[Eng.39]	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
[Eng.40]	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
[Eng.41]	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
[Eng.42]	And they did all eat, and were filled.
[Eng.43]	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
[Eng.44]	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
[Eng.45]	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
[Eng.46]	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
[Eng.47]	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
[Eng.48]	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
[Eng.49]	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
[Eng.50]	For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
[Eng.51]	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
[Eng.52]	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
[Eng.53]	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
[Eng.54]	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
[Eng.55]	And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
[Eng.56]	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
[Eng.1]	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
[Eng.2]	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
[Eng.3]	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
[Eng.4]	And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
[Eng.5]	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
[Eng.6]	He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
[Eng.7]	Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
[Eng.8]	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
[Eng.9]	And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
[Eng.10]	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
[Eng.11]	But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
[Eng.12]	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
[Eng.13]	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
[Eng.14]	And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
[Eng.15]	There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
[Eng.16]	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
[Eng.17]	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
[Eng.18]	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
[Eng.19]	Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
[Eng.20]	And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
[Eng.21]	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
[Eng.22]	Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
[Eng.23]	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
[Eng.24]	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
[Eng.25]	For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
[Eng.26]	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
[Eng.27]	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.
[Eng.28]	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
[Eng.29]	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
[Eng.30]	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
[Eng.31]	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
[Eng.32]	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
[Eng.33]	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
[Eng.34]	And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
[Eng.35]	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
[Eng.36]	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
[Eng.37]	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
[Eng.1]	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
[Eng.2]	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
[Eng.3]	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
[Eng.4]	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
[Eng.5]	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
[Eng.6]	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
[Eng.7]	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
[Eng.8]	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
[Eng.9]	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
[Eng.10]	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
[Eng.11]	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
[Eng.12]	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
[Eng.13]	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
[Eng.14]	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
[Eng.15]	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
[Eng.16]	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
[Eng.17]	And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
[Eng.18]	Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
[Eng.19]	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
[Eng.20]	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
[Eng.21]	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
[Eng.22]	And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
[Eng.23]	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
[Eng.24]	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
[Eng.25]	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
[Eng.26]	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
[Eng.27]	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
[Eng.28]	And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
[Eng.29]	And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
[Eng.30]	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
[Eng.31]	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
[Eng.32]	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
[Eng.33]	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
[Eng.34]	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
[Eng.35]	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
[Eng.36]	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
[Eng.37]	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[Eng.38]	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
[Eng.1]	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
[Eng.2]	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
[Eng.3]	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
[Eng.4]	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
[Eng.5]	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
[Eng.6]	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
[Eng.7]	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
[Eng.8]	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
[Eng.9]	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
[Eng.10]	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
[Eng.11]	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
[Eng.12]	And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
[Eng.13]	But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
[Eng.14]	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
[Eng.15]	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
[Eng.16]	And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
[Eng.17]	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
[Eng.18]	And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
[Eng.19]	He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
[Eng.20]	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
[Eng.21]	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
[Eng.22]	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
[Eng.23]	Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
[Eng.24]	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
[Eng.25]	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
[Eng.26]	And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
[Eng.27]	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
[Eng.28]	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
[Eng.29]	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
[Eng.30]	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
[Eng.31]	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
[Eng.32]	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
[Eng.33]	And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
[Eng.34]	But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
[Eng.35]	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
[Eng.36]	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
[Eng.37]	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
[Eng.38]	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
[Eng.39]	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
[Eng.40]	For he that is not against us is on our part.
[Eng.41]	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
[Eng.42]	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
[Eng.43]	And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
[Eng.44]	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
[Eng.45]	And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
[Eng.46]	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
[Eng.47]	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
[Eng.48]	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
[Eng.49]	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
[Eng.50]	Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.
[Eng.1]	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
[Eng.2]	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
[Eng.3]	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
[Eng.4]	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
[Eng.5]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
[Eng.6]	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
[Eng.7]	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
[Eng.8]	And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
[Eng.9]	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
[Eng.10]	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
[Eng.11]	And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
[Eng.12]	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
[Eng.13]	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
[Eng.14]	But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
[Eng.15]	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
[Eng.16]	And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
[Eng.17]	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
[Eng.18]	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
[Eng.19]	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
[Eng.20]	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
[Eng.21]	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
[Eng.22]	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
[Eng.23]	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
[Eng.24]	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
[Eng.25]	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[Eng.26]	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
[Eng.27]	And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
[Eng.28]	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
[Eng.29]	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
[Eng.30]	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
[Eng.31]	But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
[Eng.32]	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
[Eng.33]	Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
[Eng.34]	And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
[Eng.35]	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
[Eng.36]	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
[Eng.37]	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
[Eng.38]	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
[Eng.39]	And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
[Eng.40]	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
[Eng.41]	And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
[Eng.42]	But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
[Eng.43]	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
[Eng.44]	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
[Eng.45]	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
[Eng.46]	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
[Eng.47]	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
[Eng.48]	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
[Eng.49]	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
[Eng.50]	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
[Eng.51]	And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
[Eng.52]	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
[Eng.1]	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
[Eng.2]	And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
[Eng.3]	And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
[Eng.4]	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
[Eng.5]	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
[Eng.6]	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
[Eng.7]	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
[Eng.8]	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
[Eng.9]	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
[Eng.10]	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
[Eng.11]	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
[Eng.12]	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
[Eng.13]	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
[Eng.14]	And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
[Eng.15]	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
[Eng.16]	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
[Eng.17]	And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
[Eng.18]	And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
[Eng.19]	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
[Eng.20]	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
[Eng.21]	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
[Eng.22]	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
[Eng.23]	For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[Eng.24]	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
[Eng.25]	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
[Eng.26]	But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
[Eng.27]	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
[Eng.28]	And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
[Eng.29]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
[Eng.30]	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
[Eng.31]	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
[Eng.32]	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
[Eng.33]	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
[Eng.1]	And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
[Eng.2]	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
[Eng.3]	And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
[Eng.4]	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.
[Eng.5]	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
[Eng.6]	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
[Eng.7]	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.
[Eng.8]	And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
[Eng.9]	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
[Eng.10]	And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
[Eng.11]	This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
[Eng.12]	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
[Eng.13]	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
[Eng.14]	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
[Eng.15]	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
[Eng.16]	And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.
[Eng.17]	And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.
[Eng.18]	Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
[Eng.19]	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
[Eng.20]	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
[Eng.21]	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
[Eng.22]	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
[Eng.23]	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
[Eng.24]	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
[Eng.25]	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
[Eng.26]	And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
[Eng.27]	He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
[Eng.28]	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
[Eng.29]	And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
[Eng.30]	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
[Eng.31]	And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
[Eng.32]	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
[Eng.33]	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[Eng.34]	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
[Eng.35]	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?
[Eng.36]	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
[Eng.37]	David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
[Eng.38]	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
[Eng.39]	And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
[Eng.40]	Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
[Eng.41]	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
[Eng.42]	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
[Eng.43]	And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
[Eng.44]	For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
[Eng.1]	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
[Eng.2]	And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
[Eng.3]	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
[Eng.4]	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
[Eng.5]	And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:
[Eng.6]	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
[Eng.7]	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
[Eng.8]	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.
[Eng.9]	But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
[Eng.10]	And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
[Eng.11]	But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
[Eng.12]	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
[Eng.13]	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
[Eng.14]	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
[Eng.15]	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:
[Eng.16]	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
[Eng.17]	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
[Eng.18]	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
[Eng.19]	For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
[Eng.20]	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
[Eng.21]	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:
[Eng.22]	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.
[Eng.23]	But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
[Eng.24]	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
[Eng.25]	And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
[Eng.26]	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
[Eng.27]	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
[Eng.28]	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
[Eng.29]	So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
[Eng.30]	Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
[Eng.31]	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
[Eng.32]	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
[Eng.33]	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
[Eng.34]	For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
[Eng.35]	Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
[Eng.36]	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
[Eng.37]	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
[Eng.1]	After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.
[Eng.2]	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
[Eng.3]	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.
[Eng.4]	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
[Eng.5]	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
[Eng.6]	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
[Eng.7]	For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
[Eng.8]	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
[Eng.9]	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
[Eng.10]	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
[Eng.11]	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
[Eng.12]	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
[Eng.13]	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
[Eng.14]	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
[Eng.15]	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
[Eng.16]	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
[Eng.17]	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
[Eng.18]	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
[Eng.19]	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
[Eng.20]	And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
[Eng.21]	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
[Eng.22]	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
[Eng.23]	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
[Eng.24]	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
[Eng.25]	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
[Eng.26]	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
[Eng.27]	And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
[Eng.28]	But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
[Eng.29]	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
[Eng.30]	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
[Eng.31]	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
[Eng.32]	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
[Eng.33]	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
[Eng.34]	And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
[Eng.35]	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
[Eng.36]	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
[Eng.37]	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
[Eng.38]	Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.
[Eng.39]	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
[Eng.40]	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
[Eng.41]	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[Eng.42]	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
[Eng.43]	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
[Eng.44]	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
[Eng.45]	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
[Eng.46]	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
[Eng.47]	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
[Eng.48]	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
[Eng.49]	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
[Eng.50]	And they all forsook him, and fled.
[Eng.51]	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
[Eng.52]	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
[Eng.53]	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
[Eng.54]	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
[Eng.55]	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
[Eng.56]	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
[Eng.57]	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
[Eng.58]	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
[Eng.59]	But neither so did their witness agree together.
[Eng.60]	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
[Eng.61]	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
[Eng.62]	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
[Eng.63]	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
[Eng.64]	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
[Eng.65]	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
[Eng.66]	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
[Eng.67]	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
[Eng.68]	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
[Eng.69]	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
[Eng.70]	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.
[Eng.71]	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
[Eng.72]	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
[Eng.1]	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
[Eng.2]	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.
[Eng.3]	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
[Eng.4]	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
[Eng.5]	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
[Eng.6]	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
[Eng.7]	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
[Eng.8]	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
[Eng.9]	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
[Eng.10]	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
[Eng.11]	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
[Eng.12]	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
[Eng.13]	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
[Eng.14]	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
[Eng.15]	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
[Eng.16]	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
[Eng.17]	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
[Eng.18]	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
[Eng.19]	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
[Eng.20]	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
[Eng.21]	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
[Eng.22]	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
[Eng.23]	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
[Eng.24]	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
[Eng.25]	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
[Eng.26]	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
[Eng.27]	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
[Eng.28]	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
[Eng.29]	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
[Eng.30]	Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
[Eng.31]	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
[Eng.32]	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
[Eng.33]	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
[Eng.34]	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[Eng.35]	And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
[Eng.36]	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
[Eng.37]	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
[Eng.38]	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
[Eng.39]	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
[Eng.40]	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
[Eng.41]	(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
[Eng.42]	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
[Eng.43]	Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
[Eng.44]	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
[Eng.45]	And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
[Eng.46]	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
[Eng.47]	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
[Eng.1]	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
[Eng.2]	And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
[Eng.3]	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
[Eng.4]	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
[Eng.5]	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
[Eng.6]	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
[Eng.7]	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
[Eng.8]	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
[Eng.9]	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
[Eng.10]	And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
[Eng.11]	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
[Eng.12]	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
[Eng.13]	And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
[Eng.14]	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
[Eng.15]	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
[Eng.16]	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
[Eng.17]	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
[Eng.18]	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
[Eng.19]	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
[Eng.20]	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
[Eng.1]	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
[Eng.2]	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
[Eng.3]	It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
[Eng.4]	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
[Eng.5]	THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
[Eng.6]	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
[Eng.7]	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
[Eng.8]	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,
[Eng.9]	According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
[Eng.10]	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
[Eng.11]	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
[Eng.12]	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
[Eng.13]	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
[Eng.14]	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
[Eng.15]	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
[Eng.16]	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
[Eng.17]	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
[Eng.18]	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
[Eng.19]	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
[Eng.20]	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
[Eng.21]	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
[Eng.22]	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
[Eng.23]	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
[Eng.24]	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
[Eng.25]	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.
[Eng.26]	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
[Eng.27]	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
[Eng.28]	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
[Eng.29]	And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
[Eng.30]	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
[Eng.31]	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
[Eng.32]	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
[Eng.33]	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
[Eng.34]	Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
[Eng.35]	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
